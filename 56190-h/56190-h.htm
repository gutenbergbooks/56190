<h2 id="CRAFARD" class="nobreak p1">TESTIMONY OF CURTIS LaVERNE CRAFARD RESUMED</h2>
</div>

<p>The testimony of Curtis LaVerne Crafard was taken at 9:15 a.m., on April 9,
1964, at 200 Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C., by Messrs. Burt W. Griffin,
Leon D. Hubert, Jr., and Albert E. Jenner, Jr., assistant counsel of the President’s
Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to start out by stating for the record, for your purposes,
also, Larry, that we are continuing this deposition under the same authority
which it was commenced yesterday morning, and I know that there is no mistake
on your part that the oath which you took before is still in effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What we propose to do today is to go through in some detail
some of the papers which have come into our possession. The first thing I
want to ask you to look at is a notebook, which is a blue cover spiral notebook
entitled, “Penway Memo Notebook” and it has Commission Document No. 717,
but for the record I will clarify this that this is not the same number as the
numbers that we are using in the deposition. I will give it a deposition number
in just a minute. I am going to mark this for identification on the front
cover—I am going to mark this on the inside of the front cover at the bottom
in pen, “Washington, D.C., April 9, 1964, Exhibit 5202, Deposition of C. L.
Crafard,” and I am going to sign it with my signature, Burt W. Griffin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. For the purpose of the record, count the number of pages and
half pages. Perhaps it is a good idea to initial the bottom of each page with
your initials.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. In addition to the front cover, what I am going to do
is number the pages at the bottom, and I will put my initials on each. I will
make it clear that I am numbering only the separate sheets of paper. I am not
numbering each side of the paper. We can refer to these pages as the numbered
side and the reverse side for purposes of discussion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why don’t you have the record show that <span class="locked">pages——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Page 10 is a blank. Page 11 is a half sheet of paper which has
been torn off and there is nothing written on that page. Page 14 is approximately
a third of a sheet of paper, the bottom two thirds having been torn off, and it
does contain penciled writing on it. Page 15 is a full sheet. Page 16 is approximately
a half sheet with penciled writing on it. Page 17 is a full sheet. There
is a total of 18 pages including half sheets and third sheets of paper in the
notebook, and there is a blue hard cardboard front cover and a buff or dirty
brown back cover which is also hard cardboard. Do we have photostatic copies
of it?</p>

<p>Do you want to put that in the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I just wanted to get them numbered the same way. We can do
that later.</p>

<p>(The document was marked Crafard Exhibit No. 5202 for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to hand you what I have marked as Commission Exhibit
5202, and ask you, Larry, if you recognize that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; this is a notebook I used to keep phone numbers when I
was working for Mr. Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you buy that notebook yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I bought this myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how soon after you went to work for Jack Ruby did you
buy that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About a week after I went to work for him. You look real close
on the front you will see my name on the front of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you write that in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you read what you see on there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. C. L.—Larry Crafard, Carousel Club. Its got 1312½ Commerce
Street, Dallas, Tex. It’s real vague on there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is an impression that simply comes through as actually
scratches on there and doesn’t come through in any color?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; it doesn’t come through in any color.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you bought this book, did Jack Ruby give you any
instructions with respect to maintaining the book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just use it to put phone numbers down in, addresses of people
that called in wanting to talk, called in, put the phone number down so I’d
know how he could get in touch with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did the notations that appear in there follow any sequence either
chronological or by topic or anything of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe they do, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you want to take the time to look at it and see if you
recognize any sequence in the entries?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The first portion of the book on the first page is more or less
numbers which was used quite frequently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are referring to page 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; page 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you want to look over on the back of page 1; the reverse
side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It is also numbers that were used quite frequently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, look at page 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Page 2, I believe, was an address on the top of page 2. It was
an address that I wrote down for Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What about the remaining entries on there. Were they numbers
that were used frequently?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you want to look at the reverse side of page 2?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There is only one number on there, on the reverse side of
page 2 that we used very frequently. That was Little Lynn’s phone number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The front part of page 3?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. From the numbers on there, as far as I know, there was only
one of them that was used very frequently. It was Mickey Ryan. On the
reverse side is just more or less notations that were taken down from phone
calls. Then on page 4 is just numbers that were taken down from phone calls.
The first number on page 4, Norma Bennett, that was that one girl I was
trying to tell you about yesterday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. She was the waitress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; she was the one I started saying about that Jack had
tried to get to work as a stripper to get her to work for this friend of his,
Ralph Paul.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What you mean is that during your testimony yesterday you
remembered her name as Norma but you did not remember her last name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I did not even remember her first name, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I thought you mentioned that her name was Norma.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, you now say that the person you were testifying
about yesterday who tried to get work and who was ultimately placed at work
by Ruby with Ralph Paul was Norma Bennett?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the entry on page—what is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Page 4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Refreshes your memory to that extent, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir. On the reverse side of page 4 is just notations. No. 5
is just notations, with some things that Jack had to do on that day. Then
the reverse side of 5 is just notations, phone calls. No. 6 is some draws that
I took on different days. The reverse side of No. 6 is just notations, mostly
for phone calls that was taken. No. 7 is just notations with the exception of
the top number, the top name, Joe Roskydall, who was a friend of mine while
I was previously living in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Larry, in the pages that you have gone through so far, have
you noticed any handwriting in that book that is not your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As you go through this, if you do recognize any handwriting
that is not yours, would you point that out to us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir. On the reverse side of page 7 there is just notations
from phone calls. The bottom half of that page written in ink isn’t my handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize whose handwriting that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you able to recognize Jack Ruby’s handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I am not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you able to recognize Andy Armstrong’s handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I would recognize Andy’s writing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does that appear to be Andy Armstrong’s handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you want to look at page 8?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is my writing on page 8. That is just phone numbers,
addresses that was taken down that Jack Ruby give me to write down, addresses
that he wanted to keep. On the reverse side of that is a couple of
phone numbers. I don’t recall what they were for. Page 9 I don’t have any
idea what that was for. I don’t recall it all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that your handwriting on page 9?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It looks like my handwriting, yes. The reverse side of page 9
is blank. Page 10 is blank. A portion of a page, page 11, is blank.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Page 11, incidentally, is a half sheet of paper. Do you recall
in using this notebook whether you had occasion to rip out portions of the
notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. A couple of times I took a piece of paper and put a phone
number on it for Jack. Page 12 is just a few notations for some things that I
had to buy for myself. The reverse side of page 11 <span class="locked">is——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is the reverse side of page 12?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Page 12, yes; is just notations. Page 13 is a couple of notations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Page 13 is in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. This number in East Waco may not be mine. I don’t
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are referring to what appears to be 3902——</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. East Waco.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. East Waco, and that is written in pen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I don’t recall I ever wrote it down, and it doesn’t look like
my handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Page 10?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; page 13.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Page 13. The reverse side of that page is my handwriting. It
is just notations. Page 14 is some notations I took while I was trying to make
arrangement to ship a dog to California. It is about a third of a page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you read page 14 for us? It is a little difficult to read.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I’m not even sure what it is, myself. I can make out the name
Frank Fisher underneath, but that is all. I believe the rest of it is something,
Boeing Insurance it looks like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How is it spelled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. B-o-e-i-n-g. The reverse side of page 14 is just notations. 15<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
is just notations. I don’t remember the bottom portion of that number wrote
in dark blue ink.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It begins with “WE-7-3037”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Page 15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then there are three more lines which appear to read on one line,
“063” on the next line “Herman” printed, and the letters “Flore” and then those
are crossed out and written above it in longhand is the word “flowers”. And
then directly under “Herman Flowers” is in longhand “from Wax-a-hatchy.”
Do I understand that you do not recognize that writing, for example, “from
Wax-a-hatchy”, as being in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. “Wax-a-hatchy”, I believe, is my handwriting. The rest of it I
don’t recognize. On the reverse side of that is figuring. That is definitely not
mine. Page 16 is just notations. That is about 2/3 of a page. The reverse side
of that page is just notations, people calling in wanting reservations. Page 17
is just notations in my handwriting. The reverse side of page 17 is just notations.
Page 18 is just notations in my handwriting. The reverse side of that is
just notations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. With the exception of the pages in that book which you have indicated
are blank, every page in the book is filled, which means that there are
only a total of 18 pages in the book altogether. Do you recall from looking at
this notebook whether when you bought the notebook it had more pages in it
than appear to be there now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it did have. I’m not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall ripping out any of the pages?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall ripping out any full pages; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall whether in making the entries in that book you
used pages in a consecutive fashion or whether you made entries on pages at
random so that there would be many blank pages interspersed among pages that
had writing on them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Most of it, I believe, was—from the first portion of the book,
from the front to the back was pretty well in rotation. If I turn it over to the
back and maybe flip over four or five pages and make a notation in it, as I
recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you mean by that that you would leave some blank pages at
the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As I recall, there was blank pages left spaced in the back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So your testimony would be that the book as you see it now is
not in the same condition as it was in when you left Dallas on the 23d of November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there anything else about that book which appears to be different
from the way that you remember it when you left Dallas on the 23d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; not that I can notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any general questions, Mr. Hubert, that you want
to ask about the book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; I would like to. What was the purpose of keeping that
book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I used it, Jack would get calls he wanted to keep the number of
and I’d write the number down in this book and later transfer to another book,
and then I would use it if a phone call come in somebody wanting to talk to Jack
I’d put the number down where he could get in touch with them at so I could
give him the number to call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you testified that the first three or four pages were made
when you first bought the book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And were in fact numbers that you knew or he told you would be
frequently called, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; the first two pages on both sides.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He gave you those numbers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you were to keep the book in order to advise him currently,
that is to say, daily, of the calls and messages and so forth that came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I suggest to you, therefore, that that book, in order to serve the
purpose that you stated, it was being kept for, would have been used by making
the entries in sequence as they came up and not skipping around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I used the front of the book for numbers that Jack give me
that he wanted to keep. Then I’d use the back of the book for people that
called in for reservations at the club or he’d give me some numbers he wanted
to use right then, but he wouldn’t want to keep them, or something of this sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. My point is that when you first started to use the book did you
just put the first series of entries other than those numbers that were frequently
called just at random on any page, or would you put it in the next available
page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It would usually be on the next page. Sometimes I would skip
maybe two or three pages.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any reason for doing that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I’d want to have the pages there, a couple of blank pages there,
like this one here which should have been torn out. I don’t know why I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What page are you referring to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The reverse side of page 12. It is a list of some sandwiches I
went out and got for a couple of the girls that worked at the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you suggesting to us that the book served several functions
and that there were different portions of it for each function?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you said that the back of each page was used for the
function of putting down reservations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I might use two or three pages right in a row for that, or I might
take a page right out of the middle of the book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And leave it in the book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Usually I tore the page out. The pages I transferred over and
when I got the book full I’d just throw the book away and get another book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which book are you talking of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. These notebooks like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had more than one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I had one other notebook similar to this, the same type
of a notebook as this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what you did with that notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I thought you testified that this was the one that you started off
with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There was another one that you bought later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. I used it quite frequently. I’d tear the pages out and write
down the reservations a lot, most of the time. I had this book and when I
started putting reservations down I thought I’d get another book and use it for
that and then I’d have this one just for the phone numbers and I wouldn’t mess
up the reservations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then the other book, when it was used up, as it were, was thrown
away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you have been through it. What we want to find out is
if there is any way that one can tell by looking at the book about the date when
any particular entry was made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you saying that you skipped around arbitrarily?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It might be 2 or 3 days before I’d put anything down in this
book in a row, maybe. Personally, I couldn’t say anything about the dates when
I made the entries.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Suppose that you hadn’t used the book for a couple of days and
then you found occasion to make an entry. Would you make that entry right
following the last one you had made or would you make it at some other page?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Several times I would flip over in the book to the next empty
page, put down an entry, and later I’d take the first few pages that I had left
out, left where I could and there would be a number Jack would want to keep
and I’d write the number down. These numbers on the first couple of pages
here, I think the first page is all numbers that I got the first day and then the
others is numbers I added to it later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then are we to understand that there is no possibility of determining
the sequence of events recorded in that book by referring to the order
in which they appear in the book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, an entry on one of the later pages might have
been made prior to the one on the earlier page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you testified, Larry, that you would sometimes flip the
book over and make entries on the back of the pages, and as you have just done
in front of us, you have turned the book over on its face to the back of the book.
Do I understand your testimony to mean, then, that you worked, for some of
your notations you worked backward?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. From the back of the book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But am I correct in understanding that the pages in the front
of the book which have writing on the back side of the numbered page were not
entries that were made in this fashion that we have just been describing but
followed in the ordinary sequence that you would have made in working from
the front of the book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right. The first two pages in the book, as I stated before,
are numbers that he wanted to keep. I would fill the front of the page
and then turn the page over and fill the reverse side of that same page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, as you go through there, would you leaf through those
pages from one on, and tell us what the first page is that you recognize that
wasn’t made by working from the front of the book and filling in sequence the
back of the page after you had filled the front?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it would be page No. 4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And the back of page 4 has entries on it which might have been made
because you were working from the back of the book forward?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, I believe so. I believe that is where I made those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You also explained to Mr. Hubert that you would transfer some
of the entries from that book into another notebook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you describe the other notebook for us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was a Penway notebook, but it was a larger notebook. It
was a memo pad, I believe is what it was. Was wide enough that it had a
dividing line down the middle of the page, a red dividing line down the middle
of the page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who purchased that notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how long after you purchased this small Exhibit 5202 did
you purchase the notebook that you have just been describing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was about 3 or 4 days later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was that book kept physically?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Mostly on Jack’s desk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you leave that notebook at the Carousel when you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there any entries that were made in that notebook which
were entered directly into that notebook without being placed in some other
notebook first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe there were a few in the last couple or few pages in the
notebook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The entries that were in this larger Penway notebook which you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
have been describing, did they include all of the telephone numbers that are
in this small Penway notebook which we have before us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, not all of the numbers. There were numbers—the numbers
that Jack wanted to keep and used quite frequently.</p>

<p>I believe all of the numbers on both sides of the first two pages were in that
book along with some other numbers that he had given me that he wanted
to keep that I wrote down there in the front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were all the numbers that were placed in the large Penway
notebook placed there at Jack’s instructions or did you place some of them
in there on your own initiative?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was numbers that Jack wanted to keep and he asked me to
write down, he had asked me to get another book and write them down in it
so he could have them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Up to the time that you bought this larger Penway notebook,
had Jack been maintaining a notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Very seldom that he used a notebook. He had a book full of
numbers he very seldom used it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did he keep that book of phone numbers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he had one on his desk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what kind of a book that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was a regular phone number and address book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you think you would recognize that book if it were shown
to you again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Larry, do you recall at this point if there were other entries in
this small Penway notebook which you have identified as 5202 which you do
not see in there now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I couldn’t say definitely that there was; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to refer now to the inside of the front cover. At the
top of the inside of the front cover there is a number which appears to be
“261-TA3-8101.”</p>

<p>Is that the way you would read that number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I would read it 261-7A3-8101.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize that number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, can you tell us what the number is underneath that?
Read it for the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. FE 5-3366.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize that number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is a number under that, 612. Do you have any idea what
connection that has?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you see the name “Jeff,” which is written under 612?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know who that might refer to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I can’t recall who it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is the next number under Jeff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. TA 1-1782.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That “T” is written the same as what you thought was a No. 7?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In 261——</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just a second. Half the time I’ve got to figure it out, myself.</p>

<p>Yes, that would be TA there, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And that is your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it what you are indicating is that you have a tendency
to make your “T’s” look like “7’s.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize this number TA 1-1782?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, I don’t sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, on the top of page 1 there is some sort of a word written.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The word “save.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is the significance of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That I want to save that piece of paper, that particular sheet
of paper, that I don’t want to destroy it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it that the notation “Vegas Club” with its number under
it is the telephone number of the Vegas Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And the next number is written “Jack’s home” and under that
“Whitehall 15601.”</p>

<p>That is Jack Ruby’s telephone number at home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, tell us what this next notation “Buddy” Fort <span class="locked">Worth——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Buddy, Fort Worth, phone No. AX 3-0118 with the words “twist
board” underneath it is the fact that this Buddy was a gentleman Jack called
in reference to the twist board. I believe that is one of the gentlemen had
something to do with making the twist boards in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember what Buddy’s last name was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I’m not positive. I believe it was Buddy Heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your understanding as to Buddy Heard’s connections
to the twist boards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that he had something to do with the production of
the twist board in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What leads you to believe that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Because of the way it is set up here, he give me the number,
he give me the twist boards. It was something to do with either the production
or the selling of the twist boards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, there is a line, rather a vacant space under “twist boards.”</p>

<p>I would just as soon that you not make entries in the book.</p>

<p>After that blank line there is some writing “Fort Worth” and some other
things that follow.</p>

<p>Would you read that into the record, and then tell us what the significance
of that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It would be the word “Fort Worth” phone No. “ED-51266” with
a dash, and the words “give to Mike Shore only.” That would be a number
where Jack Ruby could be reached and he didn’t want me to give the number
to anyone but Mike Shore.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know why he didn’t want to give it to anyone but Mike
Shore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was Mike Shore a person that Ruby dealt with regularly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he talked to Mike Shore two or three times a week on
the telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever have occasion to meet Mike Shore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I’m not sure, sir. I believe he was in the club. I’m not
positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever have occasion to meet Buddy Heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall where Mike Shore lived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me ask you to state again what this entry in connection with
Mike Shore pertained to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The number would be a number where Jack Ruby could be
reached but he didn’t want me to give the number to anyone but Mike Shore.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever call that number, ED-51266?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe so, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was the number ED-51266 entered into this book the first day
that you got the book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was within the first 2 or 3 days, I’m positive of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever have occasion to call Jack Ruby at that number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I recall. I don’t remember making a call at that
number.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack say anything to you which would indicate how often
he visited the premises that that telephone number was located at?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have a specific recollection of the conversation that
you had with Jack which resulted in making this entry in the book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was over the telephone, and he called in, and I
believe I said something about Mike Shore had called wanting to talk to him,
and he give me that number and told me to give it to Mike Shore only.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he indicate whether he would be at that number only that
day or for a short period of time, or whether he could be reached there every
day, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was just a couple hours that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, under the name “Mike Shore only” there is another line
which has no writing on it, and then there is an entry “St. Charles FL 7-0520.”
What is the significance of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe the name St. Charles is the last name of a gentleman
that Jack Ruby knew, but I don’t recall ever meeting the gentleman or ever
calling him to talk to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall how that entry came to be put in the book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, other than the fact that Jack give me the number. I believe
there is reference to that same number further on in the book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Perhaps when we get to it we can discuss it at that point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to turn over page one then.</p>

<p>There are no further entries on page one, are there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And we will look at the reverse side of page one.</p>

<p>Now, there is a name written here “Abe”——</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Klinman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How is that spelled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. K-l-i-n-m-a-n.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who is Abe Klinman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know what his position was or what he done for a living,
but I believe I met him at the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he a local Dallas citizen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this somebody that Jack dealt with regularly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. Four or five different times that I know of Abe called the
club, and several times that Jack called Abe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is a telephone number under there, “RI 8——”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. “4272.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that Abe Klinman’s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On the next line there is something written in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The word “personal,” the letters “UN,” that is a telephone No.
“UN-3-0400.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Whose number is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Mr. Earl Ruby’s in Detroit, that is his home phone number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. While you were at the Carousel, do you recall Jack’s ever telephoning
Earl Ruby or Earl Ruby ever telephoning Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Jack phoned Earl two or three different times. I don’t recall
Earl phoning Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall why it was Jack called Earl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. In connection—the one time that I can really recall was in connection
with the twist boards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How soon was that after you went to work for Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that would have been about 2 or 3 weeks after I went
to work for Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what do you recall about that telephone call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just the fact that he told Earl about the twist boards, and he
told him he’d send him a couple of them and some of the advertisement he had
on them, so he could promote them a little bit up Detroit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you overhear this telephone conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir; there was something said about how they was doing
there, how they was selling there in Dallas, and the fact that Jack thought that
they would really go over pretty good up in Detroit, Chicago, and in that area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, there is a number under “Earl Ruby, Detroit” is written
under “personal UN-3400” and under “Earl Ruby, Detroit” there are some other
notations. Would you indicate what those are?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It would be the No. 313 would be a code number, I believe, for
Detroit. The phone No. “UN 3-5590” which would be the business number for
Earl Ruby, and the words “Cobo Laundry” with the address “18135 Livernoise
Avenue,” Livernoise Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. May I point out for the record that Livernoise is written on two
lines along the right-hand side of the page under the line which says “Cobo
Laundry 18135” on it, and it is bracketed off from a notation, which is “Ed Pullman”
and on the next line “TA-34484.”</p>

<p>Do you recognize the name Ed Pullman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was a gentleman there in Dallas, I believe, that Jack called
several times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know what his dealings were with Ed Pullman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is a line under that telephone number, “UN-3” and then
“UN-3” is scratched out and then on the following line there is a name written.
What is that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Leona Miller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe she was a girl that called in connection with or in
answer to an ad that Jack Ruby had in the paper for waitresses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So this entry, “Leona Miller” would not represent somebody
whom Jack called regularly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not to my knowledge; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It doesn’t really go with the group of numbers then that we have
been talking about which were sort of permanent numbers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Ed Pullman though. Would he fall in this category
of people that Jack called regularly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now there is a telephone number under the name Leona Miller,
and then there is a blank line, and there is something written on the next three
lines. What is that on the next three lines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Clark Dotty, I believe it is, D-o-t-t-y.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And the telephone number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. WH 1-1227.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize the name Clark Dotty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, I don’t; sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That concludes the reverse side of page one does it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just before you finish that, let me ask you this. I notice that
there is apparently the name Clark Dotty written out at the bottom of page one
or the reverse of page one, and when it is written the first time the word “Clark”
seems to be written and scratched through and then Clark Dotty is written again
under its number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are both of those entries in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us why you wrote it twice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About the only reason I can see here would be the fact that when
I wrote it the first time instead of the name Clark I put some other name down.
Then I wrote over it and I couldn’t make it out so I wrote the name Clark Dotty
underneath it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Larry, do you recognize the name Mary Ray?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever meet Ed Pullman’s wife?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not to my knowledge, no, sir. Not that I can recall I should say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On the top of page 2 there is an entry. Mar-Din Co. underneath
that the name Henry Denture. The address 404 South Well, Chicago 7, Ill.
Phone number HA 7-3172. Do you remember how that entry came to be made
in the book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was the number, if I can recall right, Clark called in connection
with the Earl Products Co. There is a company that I believe Jack said
this Mr. Denture and himself had been partners in one time in Chicago. The
company had went broke but they still had the papers and everything on the
company. It had never been dissolved. He was using this as a name to sell
the twist boards under, the Earl Products Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Other than contacting Henry Denture at the Mar-Din Co., do
you know of any other dealings that Jack had with Mar-Din?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it your understanding that Henry Denture was involved with
Jack in the sale of twist boards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What makes you have that understanding?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Jack give me that understanding when he give me this Earl
Products Co. number, this number so I could call the Earl Products Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You mean the Earl Products Co. was at the same address and
number as this Mar-Din Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir; from what I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Hubert, do you have any questions you want to ask on this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understood you to say that Jack wanted to communicate to the
Earl Products Co. the fact that Mar-Din and Henry Denture would be associated
with the twist boards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Referring to page 2 of Exhibit 5202, I take it that the first six
entries starting with Mar-Din Co. and ending with Earl Products all relate to
the same thing, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And were all entered about the same time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am not clear just what the significance is and I wish you’d
state it again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. This Henry Denture, he called, he said it had been checked with
him in this Earl Products before in Chicago and he was using the Earl Products
Co. as a name to sell the twist boards under.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Henry Denture was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Jack Ruby was, and he called Henry Denture in Chicago about
the twist boards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you overhear the call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was there when he made the call. I don’t recall just exactly
what was said but it was something about the twist boards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he called a man called Henry Denture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you why he wanted you to make this entry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was just a number he wanted to keep.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Larry, could the name Henry Denture be a mistake? Could
the last name really have been Kenter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It could have been; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why do you say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It is quite similar and I could have made a mistake and put a
“D” down in place of a “K.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now after the entry Earl Products Co., there is a line with
nothing written on it, and then there are two names. What are those two names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Doris Land and Peggy Taylor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall either of those two girls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe they were girls who called in answer to the ad that
Jack was running in the paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And the telephone number TA 4-6895?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Would be the number where they could be reached at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now under that there is the name Teddy Walters, and Teddy is
written in longhand and Walters is printed. Are both of those your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now do you recall who Teddy Walters was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And there is a telephone number under that. What is that telephone
number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. FE 7-4644.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is an entry under that which looks like A. F. McKnight,
with a telephone number LA 6-2251. Do you remember anything about A. F.
McKnight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe Jack called, had a conversation with him a couple of
times on the telephone. Other than that I can’t recall anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what those conversations were about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That concludes page 2 on the front side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to turn the page over and ask you to look at the back
of page 2. Now there is a number WH 2-2371. Do you recognize that number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; it doesn’t mean anything to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And that is written in pen and then there is a line with nothing
written on it, and then there is the entry Riverside 7-2362 Earl Products Co.
How did that entry come to be put down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that was a local number Jack had me put down for the
Earl Products Co. If I recall right that was the pay telephone of the Carousel
Club, and anybody, he said if anybody called the Carousel Club asking about
this Earl Products Co. or anything about that, to give them this number to call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So Jack didn’t want the Earl Products number to be associated
with his personal phone at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now was there a personal phone at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just a business phone, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. A business phone. What was the number on that business
phone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember it, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it the same number as on his home phone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; can I go back a little bit on this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Going back to page 2 starting with the Mar-Din Co., the number
below that I believe, the HA 7-3172 if I remember right it seems to me that
this number and the address were different. It seems to me this number was
either a Fort Worth or a Dallas number, and this address up here was just an
address where I sent something, or something of that sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was thinking about that and it kind of <span class="locked">didn’t——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don’t think the HA number is a Chicago number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I believe that is either a Dallas or a Fort Worth number
after I think about it a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are clear that there were two different telephones at the
Carousel Club. One was a pay phone and the other was a business phone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it possible that the Riverside number was the business phone
number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It could have been; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is an entry, there is rather a line with nothing written on
it after the entry Earl Products Co., and then there is a name and address
and some numbers written; what is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Bill DeMar, Wichita, Kans. The telephone number JA 4-4241.
The telephone number JA 8-6116. Bill DeMar was a comedian that Ruby had
hired to come down to the club, and these are the numbers where he could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
reached. I believe one was a motel number and one was a business number
or something of that sort. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The entries in connection with Earl Products Co. and Bill DeMar
are all written in pencil.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And I want to ask you if these would have followed in sequence
or whether you were making these entries in there because they were
entries which were to be kept or sort of on a permanent basis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe they follow sequence, I don’t believe the number of
Bill DeMar, numbers would be anything we would keep on a permanent basis
as far as I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you also don’t think that Bill DeMar called shortly after
or that number was given to you shortly after the Earl Products number was
given to you so that the two of them were made at roughly the same time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not positive of that, sir. They could have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you about Bill DeMar. Did Jack have any business
with Bill DeMar other than to hire him as an entertainer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As far as I know, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After the entries in connection with Bill DeMar, there is a line
on which nothing is written, and then there is an entry Little Lynn OP 34,
and then 817—JE 4-8525. Do you remember making that entry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember approximately when that entry was made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I couldn’t say for dates. It was made about I believe
2 or 3 days before Jack hired Little Lynn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how did that call happen to come in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember how it come about, but he give me the number
so he could have it to call Little Lynn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Jack gave you that number or did you answer the telephone
and get that number from a long distance operator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe Jack gave me the number. I am not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, after that there are some entries. Some figures written
on the next two lines. Can you tell us what those numbers are?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I don’t know what they mean. There is the number
875, and number 1750. It seems like a hyphen behind the numbers with a
dash, and a three behind that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You haven’t any recollection what that might relate to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That concludes the reverse side of page 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to turn over to page 3. What is the name written
at the top?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The top line is “See Paul Lubeachick.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How does he spell that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that is L-u-b-e-a-c-h-i-c-k, I believe. On the next line
is “Here at 9:30.” That would be that Paul Lubeachick was going to be at the
club at 9:30 and wouldn’t be able to be there too long and he wanted to see
Jack and I was to tell Jack when he called on the phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The next entry is also an entry for Bill DeMar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It is Bill DeMar, Evansville, 824 West Idewild Drive, HA 3-7245,
and I believe that was Bill DeMar’s home address; I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now there is an entry in pen which follows that. What is that
entry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Ruth Shay, Inwood Road, FL 2-5494.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who is Ruth Shay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe she was a girl called in connection with the ad that
Jack ran in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was she ever hired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now there is a line and the name Mickey Ryan with a telephone
number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Mickey Ryan, DA 4-4378.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that a number that was put in there for permanent
reference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that was his home number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How often did you see Mickey Ryan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I have saw Mickey Ryan probably about eight or nine times
while I was working for Jack. Excuse me please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It seems to me that number should have been on the first couple
of pages that wrote down, but it seems like I transferred the number to the
front of the book after I wrote the number down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The Mickey Ryan number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mickey Ryan’s name and number are something that Jack would
keep on a permanent basis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Mickey come at any particular time of the day or night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; he’d come in sometimes in the afternoon for a little
while and then maybe he would be in in the evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And would he visit with other people in the club besides Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Sometimes Jack wouldn’t even be at the club. He’d come in
and talk to Andrew and I, and just visit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. These eight or nine times that you saw him, were they spread
out over the entire period that you worked there or was it just in one particular
brief period that he came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Over the entire period of time I was working for Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall the first time that you met Mickey Ryan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I’m not clear. No, sir; I don’t recall exactly when I met him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Tell us about the first time that you do recall meeting Mickey
Ryan and what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The first time I really remember talking to Mickey at the club
I believe he came in one afternoon and I was in the club. There was a letter
that had come for Mickey Ryan to the club and I gave that to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did anybody else receive mail at the club besides Mickey Ryan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was two or three people that had worked at the club
previously that had mail sent to the club after they left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Mickey have anything to do with the sale of twist boards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was Mickey’s relationship with Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As far as I know they were just friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any view about Mickey as to whether he was a
homosexual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Mickey seemed to be pretty decent guy. As far as I could
figure there was nothing of that sort there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever learn how Mickey met Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Mickey have any kind of business dealings with Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I know of, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You mentioned that Jack had a bookkeeper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what his name was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But that wasn’t Mickey Ryan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that a friend of Mickey Ryan’s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know, sir. It might have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Hubert, do you have any questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what Mickey Ryan’s occupation was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. As far as I knew, sir, he was a bartender.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was a club called there a couple of days, a couple of different
times asking for Mickey. I believe it was at the Gun Club where he went to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
work. When I first met him he was unemployed and then he went to work
afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was your impression that he went to work as a bartender at
the Gun Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You formed that impression from what he told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. When they called they called asking for him and they said they
wanted him in reference to a job, and he said he was trying to get a job as a
bartender.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember his having told you that he had gotten the
job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir; that is the reason I formed the impression that he
had been a bartender.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He told you so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I want to go back to that top entry on page 3 “see <span class="locked">Paul”——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me finish up on Mickey Ryan a second. Do you know what
kind of a club this Gun Club was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I had never been there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it just a bar or was it a place where people went to shoot
skeet or trap or something like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know, sir. I believe the call came in as the Hunt Club
or something like that or Hunter’s Club or something of that sort, the call came
in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So you are not sure that the name of the club is the Gun Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you have any idea where that club is located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It is near Dallas somewhere but that is all I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know if it is in downtown Dallas or in the outskirts or
what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that was on the outskirts of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would this have been a country club, a golf club of some sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It might have been; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, I am finished with that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Going to the top of page 3 that entry “See Paul Lubeachick here
at 9:30.” I think you added something to that entry to the effect that that entry
meant that that man was going to be there at 9:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The part you added was that he couldn’t stay very long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is the impression that I had when I talked to him, sir. He
said something <span class="locked">about——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have a distinct recollection therefore of that particular episode
and that man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Of the call coming in; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it a call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The man gave you that name and said that he would be there
at 9:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But that he could not wait very long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was something like the fact that he would be there
at 9:30 and he wanted to see Jack, that he couldn’t stay there for any length of
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall whether he came in at 9:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall, sir. After the club opened I was too busy to
notice who came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With an entry of that nature isn’t it fair to say that you would
have conveyed that information in its totality to Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you would have told him not merely that the
man was coming in at 9:30 but that he had said he couldn’t wait very long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall having done so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I’m not positive, sir. I don’t recall it clearly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever at any time after that see a man named Paul
Lubeachick?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember, sir. I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you do remember that you told Jack he couldn’t wait very
long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember Jack’s reaction to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I believe Mickey Ryan and a telephone number under there is
the last entry on page 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to turn over page 3 to the back. There is the name
Stanley Kaufman and a telephone number after that. Did you ever meet
Stanley Kaufman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall ever meeting him, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know who he is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now was Stanley Kaufman a name that Jack would have wanted
kept on a permanent basis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is a line with nothing written on it following the entry
in connection with Stanley Kaufman, and there is a notation “Wednesday
pay bill at phone company.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that something you were to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Something I was to remind Jack to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would we be able to date anything in this book from that
entry of Wednesday pay phone bill, for example, if we knew when Jack paid his
telephone bill in October or November? Would we be able to draw any conclusions
as to all of the entries in the book which appear before that entry “Wed
pay bill at phone company?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is a line after the entry in connection with the phone
company, and then there is something written. What is written?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Riky Kasada.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And is that somebody’s name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that your spelling of a name that was spoken to you or did
somebody actually dictate that spelling to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it is my own spelling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So it is simply what we would call your interpretation of the
phonetics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who is Riky Kasada?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After that there is another name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Scotty Milles, M-i-l-l-e-s.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Scotty Milles, M-i-l-l-e-s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir, M-i-l-l-e-s.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was a she. She was the woman who called me in reference
to Mickey on this job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In other words, she called to inquire about Mickey Ryan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you remember the conversation you had with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did she indicate where she was calling from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She said something about a club or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it this Hunt Club or Gun Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there any connection between Riky Kasada and Scotty
Milles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe so, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Under the entry reference on Mickey, there is a line and then
there are some figures written there. Do you make anything out of those
numbers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are those in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would those be expenses that you had or money that you
took out of the cash register?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you think if you sat here awhile and thought about it you
might be able to make something out of this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t believe so. It might be some bills that I had paid or
something. Maybe some champagne I had bought or something like that
that I had put down, the money I had been given and what I had spent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are clear though that those figures refer to money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I would say so by the way they are wrote down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is the significant point about the way they are written down
that indicates that they refer to money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The number 1420 is wrote down like you write down $14.20.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By doing what to the 1420?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Putting the dot behind your 14.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You put the decimal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that the way you write money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that you would say that those figures being in your handwriting
would be the way you would write figures concerning money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That concludes the back side of page 3. I want to turn to
page 4 then. What is written at the top of page 4?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The name Norma Bennett with the number CA 4-2234.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that Bennett or Barnett?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it is Bennett. As I have wrote it it appears to be
Barnett.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you think the name is Bennett.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now who is Norma Bennett?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She is a young lady that called in connection with the ad
that Jack had ran, subsequently came in and met Jack. Jack tried to talk her to
go to work as a stripper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did she ever work for him in any capacity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I know of, sir; not around the Carousel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you first see her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. When she came into the club the day after she phoned. I
believe that was about 4 weeks before President Kennedy was assassinated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you talk to her at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was your conversation with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just getting acquainted with her more than anything. She
seemed like a pretty nice girl. We got along pretty well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did she remain in the club that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe she was around the club most of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And was Jack there during that period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Jack came in after she arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did Jack stay while she was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he spent a couple of hours around the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember any conversation Jack had?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not particularly, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With reference to the entry on page 4 concerning Norma Barnett,
is there any doubt in your mind that, as it is written, it is Barnett and
not Bennett?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No doubt in my mind it is spelled Barnett, B-a-r-n-e-t-t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You got that over the phone when she called; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What makes you think that her name was not really Barnett
but Bennett?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that I already spoke of her as Norma Bennett I believe
when I spoke with her. I recall that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your testimony was that you subsequently met her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you then learn that her name was Bennett instead of
Barnett?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I very seldom used her last name after I met her. I believe
when she introduced herself it sounded to me like she said Norma Bennett when
she introduced herself to Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Obviously when you heard it over the phone you thought it
was Barnett because that is the way you put it down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But thereafter you think you learned from her that it was
Bennett?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I might have misspelled it to myself or something. I referred
to her as Bennett all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To whom did you refer as Bennett?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Whenever I used her name to Jack a couple of times when we
was talking about her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever use the name Bennett to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall ever using her last name to her, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it fair to say that you really don’t know what her last
name is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the next word after CA 4-2234?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Waitress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then under that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Judy Armstrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is under that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Congress, the phone number Congress 9-2576, Carlton, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think those four lines beginning with waitress and
ending up with Carlton, Tex., all deal with the same transaction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, the word “waitress” doesn’t deal with the
direction above it but the transaction below it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was that, a call from somebody who wanted to be a
waitress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir; I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever meet that person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall meeting her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know if Jack called her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know if he called her or not, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; let’s pass to the next entry under that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Excuse me 1 minute, please. It seems to me this Judy Armstrong
was a number that one night one of the girls was sick and one of the
other girls that had the night off and we needed another girl and this is a girl
that had worked for Jack, I believe, and we tried to call her. I am not positive
of that. Or we tried to call her to go to work or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What you are saying is that insofar as the entry concerning
Judy Armstrong which begins with the word waitress and ends with Carlton,
Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You first testified that you thought that this was a person
answering an ad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now you think that actually you all sought to call her to work
in place of someone who was ill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe the way it worked out she had called in connection
with the ad and we had her number down on the list of girls to call and one
night we needed a girl and we tried to call her and couldn’t get in touch with
her. Tried to call her to come to work and couldn’t get in touch with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that the entry on page 4 was actually made as you said
it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When she called applying for a job but you have an independent
recollection other than the entry that on some occasion you called her to just
see if she could substitute?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember whether you reached her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall reaching her, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you have never met her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; what about Burt Nelson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Burt Nelson, Chez Femme, the phone number EM 3-6324, and
I don’t know who Mr. Nelson is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is that Chez Femme?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that is a place he worked, I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What sort of a place is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall, sir. I believe it was a clothing store of some sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. A clothing store of some sort, sir, I believe, I am not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the entry under that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Buddy, hyphenized, Floyd Turner, phone number LY 2-5903,
Tyler, Tex. I don’t remember ever meeting him. I believe Jack referred to
him as Budd Turner though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would that be a call that had come in or a call given to you
by Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not sure, sir. I believe it was one given to me by Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know anything about that man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Never met him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever hear his name spoken other than in this connection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s turn over to the next page then which is page 5. Would
you read it because I can’t read your handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Page 5 or do you want to read the reverse of page 4, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I want to read the reverse of page 4 I beg your pardon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It starts with line Linda phone number RI 2-0720, and the
initials R. W. Bowsher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think that those three entries relate to the same thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe they do, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then tell us what they do mean independently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe the line DA and the line number is a number where we
could get ahold of this girl Linda, but the R. W. Bowsher I have no recollection
of what it would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does it seem to be written with a different pen or pencil?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The pencil that was used for the word Linda and the phone
number seems to have been sharper than the one used for R. W. Bowsher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it your custom to separate independent episodes by leaving
a blank line between them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I have done so most of the time; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In this case you don’t seem to have done so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Sometimes I would put them right under something else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Anyway your recollection now is that you think the word Linda
and the telephone number under it is independent from the line that immediately
follows which reads “R. W. Bowsher?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so; yes sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is Linda?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know, sir; I don’t recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You said she was <span class="locked">a——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe she was more like a girl that called in answer to
the ad we ran in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about R. W. Bowsher, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall anything about him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s pass to the next entry which is separated from R. W.
Bowsher by a blank line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Buddy Heard, Loflin Hotel, phone number KE 2-4672.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Isn’t that 71?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. 71, yes sir. And underneath that the numbers 5336827, and 100
North Florence—and the word “office.” I believe that would be the fact that
Buddy Heard was staying at the Loflin Hotel. The KE number would be a
number where we could reach Buddy Heard. The next number down would be
probably a number for the office. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the telephone for that office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe would be the 533-6827. I am not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You think that those five lines beginning Buddy Heard and ending
100 North Florence—office are all related to the same transaction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I would believe so; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think they are not related to the line which immediately
follows starting “Burt called?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I believe that is something entirely different.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Buddy Heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not positive. I believe I have met him. I am not sure.
But “Burt called” underneath <span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s not leave Buddy Heard yet. Does the name mean anything
to you at all? You might have some recollection in your mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I have heard the name mentioned several times but I don’t know
what Heard done for a living. I believe he had something in connection with the
actor’s union. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t think you have ever met him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not sure, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Go to the next entry, then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Burt will call later. You have his home number. I believe that
would be all related.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Those four lines would be related to one another?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What would be the significance of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The fact that this Burt called and wouldn’t leave the number
but said that Jack had his home number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. “You” there refers to Jack, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, this was a note that was being written so that
when Jack read it if he weren’t there he would know it was written to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is Burt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall who he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. That finishes the back of page 4. Mr. Griffin, do you
want to start with page 5?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In other words, you got through the entries “Burt called.” For
my own clarification, did we identify where the Loflin Hotel is, which city that
is in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; we didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know where that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not sure. I believe that it is Dallas. I am not positive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are all of the entries from Buddy Heard to 100 North Florence—office——</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That has been covered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then on the top of page 5 there is a series of notations. Would
you read those off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. “Get ad off to Hyman.” In other words things to tell Jack,
to remind Jack he had to do was to get an ad off to Hyman, pay a phone bill
and go to the bank and then appointment call to Earl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what ad there was to get off to Hyman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was the ad in connection with the twistboards.
I am not positive. We were sending an ad to this Hyman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall where the ad was to be placed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir. He was to mail it, I believe, I am not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is the meaning of “appointment call to Earl”? What is an
appointment call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had called and asked the operator to place the call at a
certain time and to call him back when the connection had been made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The mailing of the ad to Hyman and the paying of the phone
bill and the going to the bank and the appointment call to Earl, did these all
occur on the same day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is a line drawn under appointment call to Earl. It separates
the page in half roughly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is the significance of that line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It would be that this top portion of the page would have been
1 day, things I had wrote down for 1 day. The bottom of it would have been
another day or on 2 or 3 days later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, there is an entry there “get post office box.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was that in connection with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he was going to get another post office box to use for
this twistboard setup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he already have one post office box before that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he was receiving the mail through the Carousel Club
and his home address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is a number under there RI 1-0345. Do you know whose
phone number that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And there is a line with nothing written on it after that, and
there is another entry. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. “Pauline called” at I believe 4 and will be in about 7 or
something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was Pauline?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She was more or less I’d say the assistant manager over at the
Vegas Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That was Pauline Hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I would say so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That concludes the front part of page 5; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Hubert, do you have any questions you want to ask on those
entries on page 5?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the appointment call with Earl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Those entries at the top of page 5, the four of them, the things
that you were to do or remind him of, were they simply told to you by Jack over
the phone or in person and then you were to remind him the next day or later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Things that Jack said and I was to remind him the next day. I
believe on this phone call he had tried to place it one day and he couldn’t get the
phone call through so he arranged for an appointment call the next afternoon
I believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you do it yourself?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. If Jack did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember him doing it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I can remember him placing, trying to place a call to Earl one
day and he couldn’t make it and he arranged a call for the next day. But I
don’t know if this was the incident or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What this simply means is that you were to remind him of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was then your function with respect to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall Jack ever mentioning or did you ever hear anything
about the Triangle Manufacturing Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall it, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall if Jack had any dealings with any people in
Wisconsin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I know of, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to turn over to the back of page 5. There is a name
written at the top of the back of page 5. What name is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Jerry Lindsay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who is Jerry Lindsay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He called in wanting a job. He had been a floorman in another
club and he called in asking about a job at the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is a floorman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. A polite way of saying bouncer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack employ a bouncer while you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever talk to Jack about why he did or did not, why he
didn’t have a bouncer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there any need for a bouncer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; not the Carousel Club. This would have been in connection
with the Vegas Club, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there a tougher crowd at the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. They had sometimes some pretty tough crowds out there on
weekend nights. People would get drunk and start giving them trouble. The
floorman would talk to the man trying to get him to quiet and if he wouldn’t be
quiet he would escort him to the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The Vegas Club didn’t have stripteasers did it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yet there was a tougher crowd there at the Vegas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The type of crowd that frequented the clubs, the Carousel Club
and the other burlesque shows in town was the businessmen more than anything,
whereas the Vegas Club’s clientele was more or less common laborers, working
people. It was a dance club where you could go in and buy beer, soft drinks and
you could dance, and the clientele there was of the rougher nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I was a little bit confused in your testimony yesterday.</p>

<p>Was it your impression that Jack was doing better financially off the Vegas
than off the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Definitely; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you say that with positiveness? What makes you so positive
about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Two or three different times Jack said if it wasn’t for the Vegas
Club he would have had to close the Carousel down a long time before. The
Vegas Club was making enough money to keep the Carousel and the Vegas both
running.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why do you think he kept the Carousel open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know, sir. There had been a stretch where I guess he
had had pretty bad luck with the Carousel, hadn’t been making much money
and he used the money he made from the Vegas Club to keep the Carousel going
at that time from what I understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But the time you were working there was the Carousel carrying
its own?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so; yes, sir; to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So you felt that in the month or 2 months that you worked for
Jack, both the Vegas and the Carousel were self-sustaining operations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After this entry about Jerry Lindsay, there is a telephone number
TA 7-2553 floorman, and I understand from your testimony those all should be
read together. Then there is a line with nothing written on it and there is a
notation which I wonder if you can decipher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. “Talked to Leo—Mrs. Grant.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you recall the significance of that, who Leo was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He worked at, I believe he was handling the floor at the Carousel
most of the time. I don’t recall what his last name was. I believe this was the
night that I stayed at the Vegas Club for Jack the first night. I believe Leo
called and I talked to him and then I talked to Mrs. Grant right away. Mrs.
Grant called right away after that and I talked to her. I am not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it your impression that the call from Jerry Lindsay was also
taken at the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; the call from Jerry Lindsay was taken at the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the telephone number under that, <span class="locked">EM——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is FL 1-9303.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; do you know <span class="locked">what——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall what it would be in connection with, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or the next telephone number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That concludes page 5. Now let me turn over to page 6.
There are some entries on there, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday, and then from Sunday through Monday you have
entries of amounts of money after that. Did you make those entries on there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what do those refer to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It refers to draws that I made from the till.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what week that would have been that you made that
entry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No sir; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The entries for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday are not complete.
Do you have any recollection on the basis of that that it was the last
week that you worked there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t believe so, sir. I don’t believe it was. I might
have been but I don’t believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Larry, I notice that nowhere else in this little book are there
entries of that nature. Can we assume that you only kept such records for
1 week or rather 4 days of 1 week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe this was because of the fact that Jack had agreed
to start paying me a salary and he wanted me to keep track of my draw slips,
draws on that, and then it appears about Wednesday or Thursday he told me to
quit keeping it, didn’t have to keep track of it any more or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you first went there it was just on a draw basis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then you talked to him about a salary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He told you that he would think it over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your testimony now is that after you all had talked about
a salary he wanted to know what your draw was so that he could adjust the
salary accordingly, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that these entries would have been made about the time that
you talked about a salary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir. It would have been about 3 weeks before the assassination
of President Kennedy I believe, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That you talked <span class="locked">about——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About the salary; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is fair to say then that these entries relate to that week, to
wit, about 3 weeks before the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It would be 2 or 3 weeks before the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You said that the significance of the fact that there are no
entries for Thursday, Friday and Saturday is that Jack told you that it was
no longer necessary to keep a record of your draws?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I would believe so; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did that mean with respect to whether you were going
on salary or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember what it had to do with that, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go on a salary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I never was paid any salary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you do remember he told you to stop keeping a record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that would be the reason that I quit. I don’t actually
recall him saying so but I believe that would be the reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Doesn’t that refresh your memory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No sir; it doesn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t let me finish but I will repeat it. Doesn’t that refresh
your memory with respect to the fact that you all had agreed upon a salary
then? Could it have any other significance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had said something; he said I would draw a salary but I
don’t believe there was ever any exact figure agreed upon. I don’t remember
of any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, on Wednesday, although you had not agreed
on what the amount of the salary would be, your recollection is that he told
you it was no longer necessary to keep this because there would be a salary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But there never was any salary paid at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you normally make these entries?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Whenever I’d make a draw. Usually in the evening I made
most of my draws.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you would put it in the book immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; usually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Isn’t it a fact that sometimes you would put it in there the
next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I might sometimes the next day; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Isn’t it a fact also that at the beginning of that week you wrote
down all of these days and then the entries were made as you drew for each day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now an entry for Thursday would have been made on Friday,
wouldn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it would have been made on Thursday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you just told me that there was at least the possibility.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was a possibility I would have waited until Friday but
I believe I would have made the entries on the day I made the draw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am suggesting to you that these sets of entries have to do with
the week in which President Kennedy was killed, and that is that you had agreed
upon a salary on the Wednesday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall exactly what week they had to do with, sir;
really. It could have been that week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you had agreed on salary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But not the amount of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you never were paid any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. For instance, the Saturday before you left Dallas you were not
paid a salary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had a salary been agreed upon prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall that, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If it had it would have been paid wouldn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; it would have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Doesn’t that pinpoint then this series of days as being the week
during which President Kennedy was killed on a Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It seems to; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After the entry “Saturday” there is a blank line and then there
is an entry “call home as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>How did that come to be written?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember, sir. It could have been somebody called in
to have one of the girls call home or something like this. A couple of the
girls had been married and had children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that a note left for Jack Ruby or for yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe it was for Jack Ruby. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you carry this notebook on your person at all times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. When I was in the club it was in my pocket all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And when you were not in the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Most of the time it would be in my pocket, anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now there is a telephone number written after the previous
entry, and it is RI 1-4643. Do you remember that entry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I don’t remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That concludes page 6.</p>

<p>Now let me turn over page 6 to the back, and there is something written on
there, Schroll. Is that in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then there is the name Dick Gifford, KTVT, Fort Worth,
TA 3-7110. Is that in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now do you remember how this Schroll name happened to be
written down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or who that refers to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Dick Gifford?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was I believe an MC over at the KTVT.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now do you remember how that entry happened to be put in
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was something in connection with the twist board setup. I
called him in connection with—Jack give me the number to call and ask for
this Dick Gifford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then what did you say to Dick Gifford?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was something on the price of advertisement on
TV, for a TV advertisement or something of that sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what makes you think that it was the price of a TV ad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Mostly this next line hasn’t got anything on it. It has been
erased. I believe I erased it, 150 for 1 minute, and I recall this 150 for 1
minute was in connection with a TV advertisement.</p>

<p>I don’t remember whether I made the call or whether Jack made the call or
what.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After the line 150 for 1 minute, which is partially erased,
there is an entry “Names of record shops where it can be bought.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What does that refer to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not sure of what it does refer to, sir. Probably a record
of some kind that Jack was wanting to get ahold of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall any records that Jack was interested in buying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was buying records and bought a lot of records he gave
away as prizes in the club.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of records were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Such records as, Belly Dancer and Striptease for Your Husband.
Rusty Warren records and such as that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So they were what you might call party records?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; party records.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack show an interest in any other kind of records besides
party records.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not for the club that I ever saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about for other purposes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember him ever saying anything about records for
anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That concludes the back part of page 6.</p>

<p>We will turn over to the front part of page 7. There are some entries there.
Are those entries all in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The first entry is Joe Roskydall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you tell us again who Joe Roskydall is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The name Roskydall is the last name of a friend of mine. This
Joe was a number in the phone number I called when I was trying to locate this
friend of mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is your friend’s first name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Robert Roskydall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And was Robert living with Joe Roskydall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I figured they might be related. He had been around Dallas
for quite a while and I thought they might be related in some way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is something written on the next line after Joe Roskydall.
What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It looks like Benning, EV 1-6260.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does that have any connection with Joe Roskydall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what Benning was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is written on the next line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. W. J. Groveland, DA 1-5178.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that a person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall how that entry came to be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is another entry there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Dick Lenard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; who is Dick Lenard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall that, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is another one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. KTVT TA 3-7110.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is the same number that you had for Dick Gifford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does that indicate that there was a second call made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that this KTVT here was wrote down before the other
one was. It was later he give me the name Dick Gifford for the same number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After the entry about KTVT there is a line with nothing written
on it and there is some more writing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. E. J. Evans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know who he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is the next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Stevens Park Beauty Salon, 2140 Forth Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is the significance of that entry?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Jack had me calling the beauty salons trying to get them to
promote this twist board for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you call more than one beauty salon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I called several of them around Dallas. I don’t remember
calling any in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What would you do when you would call these beauty salons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Talk to them about the twist boards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How would a typical conversation go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I’d call them and tell <span class="locked">them——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Introduce yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Introduce myself and tell them that I was promoting a twist
board exerciser and tell them a little bit about the exerciser and that we would
like to arrange a deal where we could put this exerciser in their salon, put it
for sale in their salons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you make any placements?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No sir. Excuse me, but this one here was 2140 Fort Worth
Avenue in Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That would be in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. The phone number would be WH 6-9755. Underneath that
is mail brochure. I believe we were supposed to mail a brochure to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you sure that is mail brochure and not Maisel Brothers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, I am positive that is mail brochure, almost positive of
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what were you supposed to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Mail a brochure to this Stevens Park Beauty Salon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack have brochures printed up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long after you started to work for him did he have these
brochures? When did he first have them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was about 2 weeks before President Kennedy was
assassinated he got them. He hadn’t got them very long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you describe the brochures? How many pages were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. One page. It was a sheet, I believe it was 7½ inches long and
I believe it was about 5½ inches wide.</p>

<p>It said “Twist a waist exerciser,” and then it showed an exerciser board. Then
I believe it showed a couple of the different positions of a person on an exerciser
board. I am not positive of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How big were these twist boards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. They were about an 8-inch square.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What were they made out of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was a 1½-inch pressed board.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That would be wood of some sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Pressed wood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that a fiberboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It is not a plastic though?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe these boards were made out of sort of a plastic glue
in the press board. Then underneath that would be a ball-bearing disk, sort of a
twist setup with a small piece of masonite attached to the bottom of that. The
board would twist on the ball bearings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And would you lie on the floor on this thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; you would stand on it and twist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who designed this item?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know who originally designed the item.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you get the impression that Jack had designed it himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t really know, sir. I never got any idea of who had
designed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now the brochure, did it have a picture of the twist board on
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I believe so. I am not positive of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That concludes page 7, doesn’t it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The front part of page 7.</p>

<p>Now turning to the back of page 7, there are some entries in pencil, are those
all in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now what is the first entry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Ed McMulmore it looks like. It is probably spelled wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir. I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then there is two telephone numbers written after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There is the word “Johnnie call Detroit.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But there are two telephone numbers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then the note “Johnnie call Detroit Helene.” What does that
have to do with—?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Johnnie was the first name of one of the MC’s Jack had working
for him. I don’t recall the last name. He got a call to call Detroit, to
call Helene in Detroit. Apparently he had the number because that is all I got.
I was told to have him call Helene in Detroit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know who Helene was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir. I thought it was possibly his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then there are three blank lines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And a number written upside down. What number is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is RI 6-6807.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize that number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t. I don’t believe that is my handwriting. It doesn’t
appear to be. For one thing for the fact that it is wrote with the page turned
upside down, for one thing, and the numbers aren’t shaped like any numbers
are shaped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it possible, referring to the top of the page, that this entry
which looks like Ed McMulmore is really Ed Mc, and then Mulmore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It could be; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would that mean anything to you reading it that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now written on the right side up on the back of page 7 after
the entry RI 6-6807, there is another entry. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. CEN, which would be I believe the abbreviation for Central,
and EX, which I believe would be the abbreviation for Expressway, dash 5400.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What does that have to do with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t think anything. I believe that is my writing. Let me
see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It is or is not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it is. Wait a minute, Jack was going somewhere or
somebody else was going for him and he was having trouble, didn’t know how to
get there. Somebody was going somewhere and they didn’t know how to get
there and I was talking to the people they was going to see and they told me
to have him turn at Central Expressway 5400 on McKinney to 2500.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Those are directions to get to some place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; McKinney, but I don’t remember where.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And were they directions for you or for Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. For somebody else. I don’t recall who it was for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. For a friend of Jack’s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall. I give the directions to somebody else but I
don’t recall who it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now is it your understanding then that you would drive out
Central Expressway to the 5400 block?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then at the 5400 block you would find McKinney?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Make a right-hand turn I believe on McKinney, the 2500 block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What makes you think you make a right-hand turn?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I remember something about the conversation. I am trying to
remember. I can’t remember too much of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that a conversation you had with somebody on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was. I am not positive. I would not swear to it
but I believe it was over the telephone that I was given these directions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you were to pass the directions on to somebody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What part of Dallas would that be in, following those directions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it would be the southern portion of Dallas, I am not
sure. It seems to me 5400 on Central would be the other end of Dallas, the
southern end.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That concludes the back part of page 7. Now on page 8 there
are some entries. Whose entries are those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. These are my entries.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, the first one has to do with somebody named Lenard
Woods.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Lenard Woods, his social security number, his address, 3420
Medow, Apt. No. 235. These gentlemen on this page are all members of the band
that played at the Vegas Club, and it would be Milton Thomas, his social security
number, with the address 2220 Anderson, the phone number HA 1-1026; Clarence
McInnis, social security number, the address 2607 Oakland, no phone number;
James Dotson, the social security number, the address 1136 Fletcher, his phone
number RI 7-7436; the name James T. Aycox, his social security number, 2715
Hebornia; I believe it is with a notation under that that he also was known as
Bear; they called him the Bear. His phone number was HA 1-1026.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to come to put all of those notations in
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Jack’s sister took sick. He had me get the names and the addresses
of the boys. I had understood him to say he wanted it for tax purposes
and I got the social security numbers too, so he could get in touch with
them for one thing when he did want to get in touch with them and also for he
said tax purposes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see these men at the Vegas Club and get the information
there or did you call them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I got these from, it was either Jack’s sister or Pauline.
I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That concludes the front side of page 8.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On the back of page 8 there are some entries. What are those
entries?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The numbers, the phone number WH 3-9783. That doesn’t
mean anything to me whatsoever. The phone number TA 7-9088. I can’t make
out what is underneath it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know for sure. It could be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And this telephone number doesn’t mean anything to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That concludes page 8. Let’s look at page 9.</p>

<p>There are some entries there. Are those in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t remember every making an entry of that sort. For
one thing this phone number has been gone over two or three times. These numbers
$3, $3.50, that has no meaning whatsoever to me. None of this has any
meaning to me whatsoever. I don’t recall ever making an entry of that sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you ever even decipher this 18 and then a 12 and then
something is written. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It looks like M-M-L-E-S or it could be M-E-B-L-S. That is as
close as I can come to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is a telephone number RI 7-5610 also on that page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And is that in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe so. It could be. It could be, I am not positive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That concludes page 9, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The front part. And there is nothing written on the back of
page 9.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And there is nothing written on the front or back of page 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Page 11 is a half sheet of paper and there is nothing written on
the front or back of what is left of that. Now on page 12 there are some items
“supporter, shaving cream, after shave lotion, tooth brush, code 10 hair cream.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are those in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And they are personal items?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That you purchased for yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long after you began to work for Jack was that entry
made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe about 2 or 3 weeks after I went to work for Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long before you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That would be at least 4 or 5 weeks before I left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is on the front part of page 12 and there is nothing else
on the front part of page 12. On the back part of page 12 there are a number
of entries. Can you read those off to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The name Bonnie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who is Bonnie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She is one of the waitresses at the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Salami, swiss cheese on rye with mayonnaise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then what is the entry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Ham and cheese with mayonnaise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is an M or something up ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That signifies the mayonnaise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. PS, I don’t know exactly what that PS meant there. There is
ham and cheese with mayonnaise. I am not sure what the first part of this was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would that be Betty or Becky.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It might have been Becky, probably Becky; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there a girl there named Becky, a waitress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; a waitress. Then the next entry on the page is Bill
Remike.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He called in for reservations at the Carousel Club. To continue
with that, Bill Remike, two couples at 9:30 they asked for good locations.
The next entry on that is the name Proctor, one couple at 9 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is also a reservation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Also a reservation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That concludes the back of page 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now page 13, there is an entry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The phone number WH 2-5326, Bobby Patterson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who is Bobby Patterson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he was at the Vegas Club, one of the players at the
Vegas Club. I don’t have his name down. He had something to do with the
band at the Vegas Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he somebody that you saw? Had you met him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I met Bobby Patterson; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many times would you say you met him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I saw him once or twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you see him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe once at the Carousel Club and I believe I saw him at
the Vegas Club one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall now the time you saw him at the Carousel, when
was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He come in in the afternoon and talked to Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you recall how long he stayed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He wasn’t there very long, maybe 15 or 20 minutes at the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you recall what he talked about with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was something about, had something to do with
who was in charge of the band at the Carousel or the Vegas Club or something
of that sort. I am not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the time that you think you saw him at the Vegas
Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe one night when I went over with Jack he was there.
He played at the Vegas Club. I am trying to get it straight. I think he was
a guitar player. No; wait a minute, a horn player, saxophone player I believe
it was. And this buddy of his, they had an act where the buddy lay down
across two chairs and he stepped up on his buddy’s chest and he stood on his
buddy’s chest playing his horn.</p>

<p>I believe that was Bobby Patterson. I am not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could this guy have been a police officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I am very doubtful of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You didn’t know any Bobby Patterson who was a police officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And there is no question that you had met a guy named Bobby
Patterson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No question there; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would Andy Armstrong know Bobby Patterson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I believe he would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That entry is in pencil and there is a line with nothing written
on it and then there is another entry under that. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It appears to be 3902 East Waco.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who made that entry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I have no idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I believe you testified before you didn’t think that was your
handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. I would change that. I would say that was 0902 if you
take a close look at it. You can see that, 0902 East Waco.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or could it be E Street Waco?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It might be that, but I never made the entry, I would remember
it if I saw it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That concludes the front part of page 13. On the back of
page 13 there are some entries. What do those seem to be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I’d say the first one would be call Jack at the Carousel. The
next one would be call Mr. Ruby at the Carousel. The next one would be Tex
Lacy. It is prevedo I would say or something like that. That is all I can
make out. Pre, and v-e-d-o.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does that mean anything to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. Were these entries “call Jack Carousel” and “Call Mr.
Ruby at the Carousel,” were these your entries?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. I believe this would be my entry here, too. I am not
positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And were those notes for yourself <span class="locked">or——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was something I told somebody else or something.
I don’t even—I can’t even figure why I would write it down. I don’t know.
That doesn’t really look like my handwriting. I wouldn’t have put “Call Mr.
Ruby.” I’d put “Call Jack.” And this looks like “Mr.” up at the top of the page.
It is something I can’t ever remember putting something like that on the top of
a page without finishing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That concludes the back portion of page 13. Page 14 is about
a third of a sheet written in pencil.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What does that say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not sure what it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You indicated this is Boeing and something or other afterward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then “Frank Fisher.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who is Frank Fisher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I have no idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you indicated before that you thought that was in connection
with twist boards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you still think that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It could be twist boards or something to do with these dogs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why do you think something to do with the dogs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Boeing would be possibly Boeing Aircraft and I was making
arrangements to ship one of the dogs to California, so it could be something
to do with one of the dogs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall a Frank Fisher who was a musician and who
was a friend of Jack Ruby’s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe I ever met him. I am not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That information doesn’t refresh your recollection about Frank
Fisher at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That concludes the front part of page 14. On the back of page
14 there is a telephone number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. TA 7-2553. I don’t recall what the number would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then a notation about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. “Tuna fish with lettuce wholewheat toast dry.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That concludes the back of page 14. Now on page 15 at the
top there is an entry. What is that entry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it is Charley Boland, KTVT with a number LA 6-8303.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember making a call to that number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember anything about that notation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; sir. It doesn’t mean anything to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the next telephone number on there, WE 7-3837?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That doesn’t mean anything to me. I believe I stated before
I didn’t believe I put that down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about “Herman Flowers,” that doesn’t mean anything to
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So the entry here “Herman Flowers from Wax a Hatchy” is the
last entry on the front part of page 15.</p>

<p>We will turn that over and on the back of page 15 there are a lot of numbers
written down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What do those numbers have to do with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I have no idea. It is definitely not my figuring.</p>

<p>(Short recess taken.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We are on page 16 and we are looking at the first entry on the
page. What does that entry appear to be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. “K. Hamilton.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does that mean anything to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; the rest of the page, I would say that it was somebody
had called in for reservations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It says, “9—3 couples between runway.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And that page 16 is a half sheet of paper and there is nothing
more on the page, and turning it over on the back part of that half sheet of
paper there is an entry. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. “Mr. Miller Friday 15 people Collins Radio Co.” It would be
somebody called in for reservations for 15 people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, there is another entry under that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. “Cody-City Hall.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know who Cody was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Jack had said something about it. I think he was an officer
of the law. I’m not sure if he was an officer of the law or a lawyer, or what
he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What do you recall? Do you recall the name Joe Cody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t recall the first name of the gentleman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What do you recall that Jack said about Cody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall what Jack really did say. It had something to
do with when he give it to me it was something to do with city hall, he had
to see him, or he wanted me to remind him to call him, or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When would this have been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I can’t recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Shortly before you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It might have been 2 or 3 weeks. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is nothing further on that half sheet of paper, is there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, looking at the top of page 17 there is a number written.
What is that number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. “TA 3-8101.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know whose number that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that would be the doctor’s number. I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Under there is written the name “Dr. Aranoff.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that your writing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember who Dr. Aranoff was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was Mrs. Grant’s doctor, as I recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any conversation with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; not that I can recall. I never had any conversation with
the doctor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is a line with nothing written on it. And the next line
has what looks like a telephone number on it. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The number “FR 4-2764.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that a Dallas telephone number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not positive of that. It might be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is the number familiar to you at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t recall the number at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And on the next line, what is written?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. “LA 8-4716,” the name “Debby.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is the name Debby familiar to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It doesn’t mean anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, there is a line with nothing written on it, and then there
is another line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. “Overton Rd.,” and “Hawthorne” underneath, it would be Hawthorne
Road Drive, I believe, “Porta Build, Inc.” company. This is all something
of my own here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did that have to do with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. This is all on my own. At that time, I was going to try to
get in touch with my brother-in-law who lives in Dallas, Tex., and this Overton
Road, I believe, is where one of the people that I went to church with lived,
out on Hawthorne Drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about <span class="locked">Porta——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I had at one time worked for Porter Building Corp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When had you worked for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I had worked for them the year before, the previous year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you going to contact them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was thinking about, maybe seeing if they needed any men
down there, or something.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you make that entry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. This was about a month before President Kennedy was assassinated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever contact them about a job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I called them one time, I believe, and the gentleman wasn’t
there that I had talked to, and I never called back. The Litot Trailer Park, that
is where we was staying, where my wife and I lived when we was living in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is the next entry on there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the telephone number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is the number of the Litot Trailer Park.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That concludes page 17, the front half. On the back half of
page 17 there is a notation. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Call Buddy Heard, El Paso, dial direct, tell them that you are
in town, that you are a friend and would like to get in touch with him. This is
something for Andy. He was to call Buddy Heard in El Paso.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Andy go to El Paso?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; he was to make a call; dial direct to El Paso as if he was
in El Paso. I don’t remember exactly what it had something to do with. It
seemed like this Buddy here was a comedian or something that Jack was trying
to hire or something of that sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Andy going to try to hire him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think it was just he was doing that for Jack, trying to find
out how to get in touch with him. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, there are two lines with no writing on them, and then there
is another entry. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The name Mary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know anybody named Mary, in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It has no meaning to me except the fact that my sister-in-law’s
name is Mary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the telephone number under that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It has no meaning to me whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then the next telephone number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It has no meaning, either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That last telephone number on the page is RI 1-1456, and the
other telephone number on that page is DA 4-4378. That concludes the back
of page 17. Turning over to page 18, there are some entries on there. What is
the first entry on the page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It is D 2 with a dash and then the figure 175, $1.75.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not sure unless it is maybe some draws I took that day or
something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you sure that is $2 and not $200?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It might possibly be $200.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any dealings with anybody about spending $200?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is the notation after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Jack took $20 from the bar till.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall when that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I don’t recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, there is another entry after that, “Pete White Atty.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Pete White, attorney, Fidelity Union Life Building, with a number,
RI 1-1295.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you make that entry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall anything about Pete White?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what is the next entry on there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The next entry has to do with the twist boards. It is, “Call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
beauty salon; tell them that I have a twist-a-waist exerciser,” and let them
have it for $2; in quantities for $1.75 each.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it fair to suggest that the $2-175 that is written at the top
of the page and this same entry about $2 and $1.75 both relate to twist boards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That concludes the front part of page 18. Turning over to page
18——</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The first thing on the page is “Jimmy Rhodes can tell where to
get blowups at.” Some blowups of some pictures that Jack wanted and this
fellow Jimmy Rhodes could tell him where to get them at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know Jimmy Rhodes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I heard Jack mention the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, there is a line with nothing written on it, and the name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Mr. Wooldridge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have some idea?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is another line with nothing written on it. Then there is
a telephone number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The number WH 6-6220.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does that number mean anything to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And there is another line with nothing written on it; and the
notation “8-5 tomorrow.” What did that have to do with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I can’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is another line with nothing written on it. And the name
Bob Litchfield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And a telephone number after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It is TA 7-9301.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then a name after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Mrs. Moddy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who is she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that was his bookkeeper. I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, there are some numbers. That concludes page 18, does
it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. With the exception of a telephone number, RI 7-5311, which is
right under the name Mrs. Moddy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I imagine it is her number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, there is some writing on the inside of the back cover.
There are three telephone numbers, RI 7-7436, CH 2-3442, CH 2-4114. What
do those numbers relate to, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, there is another number Newton. There is a name Newton.
Does that mean anything to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I’m not positive of that. It doesn’t appear to be my writing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is the number written under the name Newton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. 2550.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is not your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. I don’t ever recall of having wrote any of those written
in ink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That would be everything on that page except the RI 7-7436?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, on the outside portion of the back cover there are some
other things written on there. See if you can tell us what those are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The name J. L. Coxsey.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know this person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. The name Coxsey is the name of one of the gentlemen
I went to church with when my wife and I were living in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How would that be spelled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. His name was Lee Coxsey.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that the same gentleman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t believe so. And there is the number under that
that I can’t make out. Then there is a number EV 1-6979, and there is, it looks
like LV or something. I can’t understand that a bit. There is the number
FL 2-8995.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are those things in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall where you left that book when you departed from
Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was either in Jack’s office or in the room right in front of his
office where I slept days. I’m not positive whether I left it on his desk or
on a stand in my room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But in any event did you leave it in the open, or did you leave
it in a drawer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was lying right out on top of a table or a desk,
whichever it was. I’m not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Hubert do you have any questions you want to ask?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did I understand you to say earlier this morning that normally
you kept that book on your person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t leave it hanging around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right. On occasion, Jack would be there and I would
be giving him a number and he would want me to go down maybe get a paper
or something like that and I’d leave the book lay on one of the tables near
the phone and go down and come back up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then you would get your book back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I guess it is fair to say, then, that except for those occasions,
and then when you left the book, when you departed from Dallas, the book
was always in your possession?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever notice that some of the entries were made by
someone else in that book prior to the time you left for Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you willing to say that they were not made prior to the time
you left for Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, specifically, some of the entries that you have said are not
in your <span class="locked">handwriting——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were not in that book when you left for Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What makes you sure of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Nobody else had wrote in the book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No one had a chance to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Jack would have had a chance to on a few occasions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. On a couple of occasions he had a notebook just like it that he
carried himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you never saw these entries even after Jack had occasion to
write them in?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right. I never noticed them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And no one else had a chance to write them in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would it have been possible that those entries were written prior
to the time you left Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I doubt it very much. It was possible, but I doubt very much
if they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you testified this morning earlier, too, that the book seemed
to be somewhat different from when you last saw it in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In what ways did it seem different?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe there were more pages in it than was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Pages with writing, or blank pages?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I can’t recall whether they was all blank pages or whether they
had writing on them, or what.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s put it this way: Do you recall any particular pages that
are not in that book at the present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are not in a position to say, then, really, that any pages with
information on them have been taken out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your impression that the book is different than it was before you
left Dallas is based then upon the size of the book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does it seem to have fewer blank pages now than it did before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. I thought there was half a dozen or so blank pages in the
middle of the book last time I used it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your purpose in leaving the book in Dallas when you
determined to go away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was numbers that, to me, that had to do with this business
and they didn’t mean anything to me, so I just left it there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you do that deliberately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. I figured they was numbers that he wanted. It didn’t
mean anything to me. I had no use for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You wanted to see that he got them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you don’t know where you left the book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I either left it—I am not positive exactly where I left it. It was
either in his office on the desk or in my room on a stand where he would have
saw it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us why you didn’t write a note saying why you were
leaving, where you would be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I can’t say why other than what I have said the other day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you aware that Jack would argue you into staying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I thought he probably would; if I called him or anything he
would probably do his best to get me to stay, and I had made up my mind to
leave and I didn’t want to have to argue with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, that wouldn’t have prevented your writing a note.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or of calling Armstrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I didn’t even think about it a bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you think at all about calling anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This wasn’t even a matter that you pondered as to whether you
should or should not call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; nothing I had thought of. I never had any idea. I didn’t
feel that there was any real reason for me to call anyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you told me that you felt grateful to Jack for what he
had done for you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that the motivation for your leaving was not any anger.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On your part against him, but, rather, that you wanted to see
your sister?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t think you owed it to him just to leave him a note?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It just never entered my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did it occur to you that there might be a question of how much
cash you had in fact taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the salary that was owed to you? Weren’t you
interested in that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I didn’t even think about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t say goodbye to anybody when you left Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t advise anyone that you were leaving Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; other than the fact that I give the key to the boy at the
parking lot and told him to tell Jack goodbye for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did send a message of goodbye to Jack through this man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you leave word where you would be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you leave any message to the effect that you had taken $5
out of the till?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I left a draw slip in the till just like I always have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you in any kind of trouble there with a girl or something
of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That required you to leave as hastily as you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it your custom to move around like that without leaving any
contact points?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Quite frequently; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who knew you were working at the Carousel among your family
or friends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I had wrote my cousin and informed her. I believe
I wrote my mother and informed her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This girl Gail knew it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is my cousin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is your cousin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; the cousin I was referring to at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you expect to have happen to the mail that you got
at the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I didn’t even realize I had left any mail. I had wrote to the
people. I hadn’t been getting any answers. My mother doesn’t write an awful
lot, and I hadn’t got any letters from my cousin for a little while. My sister
hadn’t answered the letter I wrote to her, so I <span class="locked">just——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Weren’t you going out with a girl that you had gotten fairly
close to by that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She had left Texas at this time. She had left Texas and, as
far as I know, went out to California.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there anybody else that you were interested in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you say to us now that in your opinion, and by this I mean
your departure from Dallas under the circumstances you did depart was normal
in your life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Somewhat, yes; most of the time I go to leave, I just take off
and go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have done that before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Many times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I’ve done it two or three times I can recall. I usually leave
from around my people, if I’m around my sister I’ll say something to her that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
I’m going to take off and where I plan on going. If I leave home I usually
say something to the folks on where I plan on going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After you found out that Jack had killed Oswald, did it ever
occur to you that the way in which you had left Dallas might seem odd?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; it did occur to me that it might seem very odd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you communicate that view to anyone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think I said something to my sister to the effect that I thought
it might be kind of suspicious the way I had left Dallas, so suddenly, without
saying anything to anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you say that to your cousin, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know for sure if I said anything to Gail about that or
not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you told us that you spoke to your cousin, I am talking
about Roberts now, about the fact that you had left Dallas on Saturday evening
and the manner in which you left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall saying anything to him about the fact that I
thought it might be suspicious.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I am not suggesting that. But what I want to ask you
is whether he thought that the way in which you left might throw some suspicion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall him saying anything about it, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did it occur to you that perhaps one easy way to clarify your
position would be to contact the FBI or some police agency and tell them where
you were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I didn’t think about that. I figured that if they were looking
for me, if I had heard anything about the fact that they were looking for me I
figured I’d go to the nearest police station and tell them who I was and that
they was looking for me. But that is the only thing I thought about on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Didn’t you rather know that they were looking for you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I wasn’t positive that they were. I thought they might be;
yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had a pretty good idea that they might be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Like I say, I thought they might be looking for me but I wasn’t
positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Wouldn’t you want to find out positive evidence they were looking
for you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. If there had been any definite evidence they were looking for
me, I would have went into the nearest police station and told them who I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you mean by definite evidence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The fact I knew for sure they were. I said I just thought
that they might be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You just told us that you thought that they might be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right; I said that I thought they might be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That wasn’t enough to cause you <span class="locked">to——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; it isn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you contemplating, as a matter of fact, going to some
police agency prior to the time the FBI came to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t believe that I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you expect to get this positive evidence that they were
looking for you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I just figured if it was possible they might put something in the
paper or maybe something over the radio or something and if I heard that they
was looking for a young fellow that had worked for Ruby by the name of Larry
or anything like that, they was looking for this young fellow that had worked
for Ruby or anything, that I would have went in and told them who I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understood you said there was no radio or newspaper at your
sister’s house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; but I was at other people’s places that had radios.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You expected to get the information that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I didn’t stay with my sister all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that you were making an effort to find out if they were looking
for you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was where I would have found out if it was so, yes, on several
occasions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you went to listen to radio programs or TV programs
with an effort to find out, among other things, whether they were looking
for you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that you might communicate with them and tell them where
you were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right. I figured one thing. I hadn’t done anything
wrong. I had no reason to hide from anything because I hadn’t done anything
wrong, so if there had been any indication whatsoever that they was looking
for me I would have walked into the nearest police station and turned myself in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you feel that anybody else had done anything wrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. I knew from what I had heard that Ruby had killed, shot
Oswald, I knew it was wrong. Like I say, I mean I had no idea that anybody
else connected with him had done anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What made you think in the first place that there might be
some suspicion cast upon you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, the way I left, after I found out that Ruby shot Oswald,
the way I left, I thought just suddenly like that, didn’t leave any word to anybody
where I was going or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How would that connect you with the killing of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I had been working for Ruby. He had shot Oswald. It could
be kind of insinuating circumstances why I left and everything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you had left before Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I had left before Oswald was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that really your concern was not that they would connect you
with the killing of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But <span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. They might think that I had done something wrong, myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With reference to what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. To anything. I mean breaking the law in any way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With reference to the shooting of the President, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. How is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With reference to shooting of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, it could be that they might have thought I was involved
in that in some way or something like that, and I just figured if they thought,
you know, the way I had left if they had any idea at all that would further
their idea, I mean if they had any idea that any of Ruby’s employees were
involved in it, that would further the idea that I had been involved in this, in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You actually thought about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I <span class="locked">felt——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was the thing that gave you concern and that is what you
talked to your sister about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; it kind of bothered me a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Couldn’t you have ended the bother by going to the nearest
police force?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I probably could have. I never even thought about going in
like that, just walking in and talking to them, asking them about it or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you fear when you left Dallas that things might be happening
which would get you in trouble?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; it never entered my mind. I figured that that would be
the end of things when they had caught Oswald, I kind of figured that would
be the end of it and he would come to trial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you fear that things might be happening which would get
Jack or other people you knew in trouble?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s put it point blank to you, Larry. Did you think
that possibly Ruby or someone among his friends might have had something to do
with this and the best thing for you to do as an innocent person was to get out
of there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I didn’t, because if I had had the slightest idea that
him or anybody he knew had anything to do with it, the first thing I would
have done would have been to walk right straight down to the police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then when you found out that he had killed Oswald, didn’t
it occur to you that he might be killing Oswald to remove the President’s
murderer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe it really did occur to me at that time; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You see the point now, don’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I understand what you are trying to say. But later we
discussed the fact that Oswald and Ruby might have been connected, as I believe
everybody else has.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you think there is anything, can you think of anything as a
result of what you saw down there in Dallas that would indicate that Jack
shot Oswald out of some kind of fear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I can’t really think of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Out of some motive of self-preservation other than, or not necessarily
connected with the shooting of the President, but that he would have
feared Oswald in any kind of a way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I can’t think of anything that would prove that, that
would give me any reason to believe that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have some idea on the basis of your experience with
Jack and so forth as to why he shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I haven’t, other than the fact that I believed ever since
it happened that Jack was out of his mind. I believe right today that the
man should be in a mental institution.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that simply because you can’t conceive of anybody doing
what he did, or from some other facts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I can’t conceive of a man that is in his right mind walking
up to a man, just walking up to a man, putting a gun in his belly and pulling
the trigger.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In a police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right, I can’t conceive of it, of any man that is in his
right mind doing so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But, other than that, is there any indication that you had that
Jack wasn’t in his right mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you saw him for a period of about maybe 18 hours
after the President was shot. In that period that you saw him after the President
was shot, is there anything that indicated to you that he wasn’t in his
right mind in the way that, you know, his behavior was markedly different?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. From the way Jack Ruby usually acted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. One thing he was kind of, when he would speak it was kind of a
choppy way of speaking. He would say two or three words, wait and then
say two or three more, which wasn’t usual for Jack. He might bust off in
the middle of a sentence and then pause for a couple of seconds before he completed
the sentence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is this what you were referring to when you talked about Jack
being nervous?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; very much that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it the kind of nervousness that a man might have if he
were afraid himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir; that is possible, a man that was afraid for himself
would be nervous like this; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You observed those conditions prior to the time you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This nervous condition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; on the night when we went out and took those pictures
he was pretty well that way, he would talk in a burst and he would stop and
then talk in a burst again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Larry, isn’t it a fact that the reason why you left was
because you didn’t want to have any part of what you saw going on then?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t understand what you mean by that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You saw Jack being nervous. You saw him taking all these
pictures. You saw his great concern about the death of the President. Didn’t
it occur to you, and isn’t it a fact that the reason you had left was because
you figured that you didn’t want to have any part of anything that was going
on, although you didn’t know what was going on? Isn’t that a fact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. I cannot say that it is, because I had no idea there was
anything going on, period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there anything about Jack that indicated to you a peculiar
concern about the death of the President, that the death of the President itself
was some sort of a concern, a great concern to him more than it seemed to be to
you or to Andy or anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It seemed to me more like it was more of a personal effect
on him than it did on anybody else that I talked to very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I can’t really explain it. To me, I was shocked and everything,
but it wasn’t like it had been a member, more or less, say, a member
of my own family. With him, it hit him more like it had been a member of
his own family, it seemed to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There was something he said in that connection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think he said something, but I don’t recall what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you this: Were you present when Jack learned that
Officer Tippit had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so. I’m not sure. I think Jack was at the club or
come to the club just shortly afterward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember Jack’s talking about Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I think he said he knew him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack talk a lot about the death of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe any more than anybody else did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Officer Tippit? Did he talk about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t recall as he said much about it other than the
fact that he said he knew him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You indicated yesterday that you felt Jack’s concern over
the death of the President was related to his concern for the convention business
in Dallas. You remarked about his saying this is going to ruin the
convention business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Something to that effect. That was one of the first things he
said, but that was the only time he referred to it that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As you look at his activities, do you think that his concern
or what had happened down in Dallas, meaning the death of the President
and perhaps even the death of Officer Tippit, that Jack’s concern might have
been more related to his fear about what would be happening to his business
rather than any sympathy and grief over the man himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I can’t say that he did. I mean it seems to me like if a
man was really concerned about his business he wouldn’t have closed Friday
night like he did. It seems to me like something like that—you know what
I mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But, again, that is an impression you are drawing from some
sort of outside event?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am asking you to look at just what Jack was talking about
and the things that he seemed to be concerned with and occupied with after
the death of the President.</p>

<p>Were they things, was his conversation mostly about the President, or was
it mostly about the things that he had to do in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was mostly about the President, as near as I can
recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you talk with him at the Carousel about the
President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oh, while he was there the first time we was talking about
it. I’m trying to recall there was something said there when he said something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
about he was going to be closed, that we was going to be closed that night.
He seemed to think if we closed and the other clubs stayed open it might help a
little bit, help the club a little bit, or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So that in Jack’s mind closing was an aid to his business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Larry, when you decided to go, to leave Dallas, I take it
that you packed up all your belongings because you didn’t expect to come back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you told us you had two little cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you search around to see that you had done all that needed
to be done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I knew I had everything that I wanted to take with me. I left
a couple old shirts and a pair of old pants, I believe, that I left there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you left the book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about that letter that you had written to Gale?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t even recall a letter that I had wrote to her that I had
left there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know that there was a letter there with your aunt’s
address on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I had received a letter, but I believe I had threw the envelope
into the waste basket or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long before you left had you received that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think it had been probably about a week, I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did it stay in the wastebasket all that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think I had it lay on my desk, on the table there, for a couple
days, 3 or 4 days, or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then threw it in the wastepaper basket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; the wastebasket wouldn’t have gotten empty until
I emptied it, and I wouldn’t have emptied it until it was full.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did anyone else know about your aunt, her address in Harrison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe Jack and Andy both knew that I had received a letter
from my cousin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your aunt and cousin? Well, it is Gail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Gail, Miss Eaton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did they know that? How do you remember that they
knew that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, the fact, the reason I remember it, there was some mail in
on Jack’s desk for one of the guys and he told me to bring it out by the cash
register on the front desk and give it to them when I went in, and when I went
and got it there was this letter addressed to me. I said something to Jack
because he hadn’t give it to me and he said he didn’t know that was my name,
and Andy was there when I said something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any reason to believe that he or Andy made a record
of your aunt’s address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you left, then, so far as you knew, no one was aware of
your aunt’s address or of Gail Eaton’s address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had forgotten that the envelope was in the wastepaper
basket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I had said something to one of the waitresses about my
cousin in Michigan, about where she had lived in Michigan, that she lived in
Harrison.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which one of the waitresses did you say that to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe there was two of them there at the time. I think it was
Bonnie and Little Marg, Marjory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had told them that you had a cousin called Gail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that she lived in Harrison?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How close a cousin was that to you, a first cousin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. A first cousin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there any sort of affection between you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you told that to the girls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I said something to them about the fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see Gail when you stopped with your aunt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, she knew you worked for Ruby at a Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you got to see her, the news was out that Ruby had killed
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you speak to her about your connection with Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe we discussed it; yes. I know we talked about it. I
told her about what I had done for Jack, what kind of work I had done with
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell her when you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell her or them—by them I mean your aunt and uncle—the
circumstances under which you had left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know for sure if I did or not, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You must have told them that you left prior to Oswald’s being
shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I told them that I had left Saturday, about noon Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they seem to express any concern about the matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you come to form in your own mind some concern about
the matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not other than the fact that I figured that I did say if I heard
anything in the news about looking for an employee of Ruby’s that had left, I
would go to the law officers and let them know who I was and that I had been
working for Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, as I understand it, then, the only one that really discussed
with you the position or the suspicion that you might be under was your sister,
and that neither your aunt nor your uncle nor your cousin, Gail, nor your other
cousin, Cliff Roberts, and his wife, expressed any concern or discussed the matter
with you at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I can recall where there was anything said about that
I might be suspected of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The only one you really talked to about that was your sister?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You got to see her, I think, the night before the FBI came,
didn’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that you really hadn’t had an opportunity to listen to any
radios or newspapers or to see whether anyone was looking for one of Jack’s
employees who had left suddenly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not too much; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you had any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just in the cars, when I was riding in the cars if they had the
radio on and the news was on I could hear whatever come over the news that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That concern, then, that resolution of yours that if you heard
about that you would turn yourself in to the police was formed much earlier
than when you got to see your sister?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was formed when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Shortly after I heard, found out that Ruby had shot Oswald. I
decided the fact if I heard anything in the news about that—that they was
hunting for one of Ruby’s employees—I would have gone to the nearest law
officers and told them that I had been an employee of Ruby’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I guess we had better break for lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:50 p.m., the proceeding was recessed.)</p>

<h3>TESTIMONY OF CURTIS LAVERNE CRAFARD RESUMED</h3>

<p>(The proceeding reconvened at 2:30 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me repeat the statement we have been making at the beginning
of every one of these sessions, that this is a continuation of the deposition
which was begun on Wednesday morning with Mr. Crafard and, of course, you
understand, Larry, that the oath which you took at the beginning is still in effect
for this deposition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, before we proceed with the examination of further documents,
I might mention for the record that Mr. Crafard and I had lunch this
afternoon at Hogates Restaurant and we discussed informally some of his experiences
in Dallas and his impressions of the events that have transpired since
he first came to Dallas and since he left Dallas, and I might—I am going to raise
a few of the topics, and I hope I cover them all. If I have left any of them out,
I wish, Larry, that you would clarify the record on it.</p>

<p>I ask you, first of all, if we had a conversation about the homosexual relationship
that you had mentioned before of Jack Ruby and George Senator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did I ask you whether you felt that Jack and George were
involved in a homosexual relationship between themselves?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is your view of their relationship?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. My personal opinion is the fact that there was no relationship
between the two due to the fact, mostly because of the fact that they did not
show the general affection towards each other that two men in this type of
relationship would tend to show.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any questions you would like to ask on that topic,
Mr. Hubert?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yesterday, you gave us the opinion that you thought both Ruby
and Senator were possibly homosexuals.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But your point now is that they might be, but that you didn’t
perceive anything that would indicate that they practiced homosexuality between
themselves?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right. There was, to my opinion, they were both—appeared
to me to have a homosexual tendency of sorts, but showed no—but it
showed no signs that there was a relationship between the two of them in this
way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I think we also discussed whether or not you believed that Jack
Ruby was capable of engaging in activities which he would keep secret from
other people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you tell us now what your view is about his ability,
whether he is the kind of person that could have engaged in that activity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. From what I knew of his background and what I know of him,
I would say definitely that he is the type of person that could engage in an
activity of any type without anyone else having any knowledge of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Hubert, do you want to ask any questions on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We also discussed at lunch whether or not there—you have any
recollection of any connection between Ruby and Oswald, and you mentioned to
me a statement that you heard made at one time.</p>

<p>Would you tell us what that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that was the one I made just as we got out of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. If I recall the words, I said, I told you that I believe that before
I left Dallas I had heard someone state that Oswald had been in the Carousel
Club on at least one previous occasion, that I wasn’t positive who had made the
statement, that I believed that it was made before I left Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you indicate to me you had some idea?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I thought it had been Andrew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. By that, you mean Andy Armstrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say before you left Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you mean, before you left Dallas the last time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Before I left Dallas after the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean before you left Dallas on November 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. It seems to me that something had been said about Oswald
being in the club, and I figured that probably it had been Andrew who said this
because I had talked to him—been with him—more than I had been with anybody
else on that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you seen Andrew since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Only at the Ruby trial in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you mention it to him, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I hadn’t even thought about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he talk to you about it then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, this statement must have been made to you between
12:30 on the 22d and about really 5 or 6 o’clock in the afternoon of the 23d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t see Andy after that, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I only saw Andy—I never saw Andy after the 22d, when President
Kennedy was assassinated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is right. Andy woke you up, you all looked at TV, and
then Jack came in and they all went off and you went to bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, you got up the next morning and talked to Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It wasn’t Ruby who said that, was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It wasn’t George Senator who said it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you talk to anybody else other than that girl on the phone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She didn’t mention it to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who else could it be but Andy Armstrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I said I believe I heard this statement had been made before
I left Dallas, I am not positive that it was made before I left Dallas, I might
have heard the statement afterwards, after I left Dallas or after I went back,
but I believe I heard the statement before I left Dallas on the 23d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If you did hear it before you left Dallas, it had to be Armstrong;
isn’t that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is no question about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Because you didn’t speak to anybody else that you could have
gotten it from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you think it is possible that you read it in the paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t believe so. I didn’t read the papers on it too much.
I had a couple of the <span class="locked">papers——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think you got it over the radio or TV or any other news
media?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your thought is that you got the statement that Ruby—that
Oswald had been in the Carousel Club from a person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, if it was after you left Dallas, can you help us as to what
person that might have been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I cannot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would it have been any of your relatives?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would it have been anybody you worked with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t believe so. If it had been after I left Dallas it
would have been somebody who picked me up when I was hitchhiking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You indicated to me, Larry, I think in the car, that Sunday you
watched television someplace, that you may have seen this on television Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I didn’t see television Sunday, I was on the road all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You didn’t stop in any restaurants or bars and watch television
along the way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I watched television the day of the assassination and saw
him on the morning after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On Monday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; the morning after the assassination, Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On Saturday between the time that you talked with Ruby, when
you called him at his <span class="locked">home——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And the time that you left Dallas, did you see anybody other
than the man at the garage with whom you left the key?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not to talk to anybody; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you rode out of Dallas with that man whom you
had met at the State Fair, did you talk with him about the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe we discussed it very much. He was telling me
about his place out on the lake more than anything else, so far as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he know you had worked for Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe there was something said about the fact that I worked
for Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did this man know Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it possible that he would have mentioned having seen Oswald
at the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had he ever been in the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. To my knowledge, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, on Saturday—or on Friday, rather, the day of the assassination,
did you and Andy and Jack Ruby watch television at the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Some, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember seeing Oswald’s picture on television on
Friday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember it, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember watching television or listening to the radio
when it was announced that Oswald had been apprehended and was the suspect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Let’s see. I believe we heard that over the television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any recollection of who was present when you
heard that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Larry, do you have a recollection on Friday of your activities
from the time Andy woke you up until Jack left to go to Eva Grant’s house?
Can you reconstruct for us your activities in some detail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just a vague outline is all I can do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Try to reconstruct this as best you can, what you did first, how
long you watched television, and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I had the television on the rest of the day up until about—it
must have been about 7 or 7:30 when I turned the television off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was the television set located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. In Jack’s office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How big an office did he have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oh, about 10 by 10 or 10 by 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have chairs in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had a couch, a desk, and a chair in front of his desk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you spend a good bit of the day in that office watching
television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. After you got up, when did you first go into that
office and start to watch television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Almost immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how long did you stay in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We turned the television on and there was nothing on the television
just right at that time, on the channel we had it on. We switched channels,
while the set was warming up we went out front and listened to Andy’s
radio until the television warmed up, and then we watched television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Jack Ruby wasn’t there at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You say you stood in front of the television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, we stood and watched the television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it possible to sit in Jack’s office and watch television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you stand there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you sit, and where was the television set?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We sat on the couch and the set was in the corner behind the
door. There was a filing cabinet between it and the wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And sitting on the couch you could watch the television set?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have to close the door in order to watch the television
set?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there a telephone in that office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How far away, how many extensions were there to the telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was three of them altogether.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There were three extensions or was there a <span class="locked">telephone——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The telephone and two extensions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Where were the two extensions in relation to the
telephone in Jack’s office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was one by the bar and one by the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How far away would that be from Jack’s office, each of those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The first one, the one by the door would probably be 20, maybe
20, 25 feet from the office. The other one would be maybe about 10 feet further,
between 30 and 35 feet, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You and Andy placed yourselves in front of that television set?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What do you recall happening, what was the first thing, do you
have any recollection of what you saw on television, how things transpired on
television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t. I believe they were at the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe they were at the hospital when we turned the television
on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You recall seeing some scenes at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I can recall seeing some scenes but I am not sure whether
it was as soon as we turned the television on or afterwards during that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What do you recall seeing on television before Jack Ruby came
into the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t really recall what we saw on television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. While you were, between the time you turned that television<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
set on and sat down and watched it and Jack came in, did you leave the office,
did you do other duties in the club, or just watch TV?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We just watched television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. When Jack came in, were you people seated in his
office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When Jack arrived, did you go out into the outer part of the
club to talk with Jack, or did you remain in the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We went out by the front door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. More room for all of us to sit down who was in the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could you watch television from the front door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you keep abreast of the news while you were out there by
the front door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Andy had his transistor radio on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long would you say it was between the time that you and
Andy sat there and watched television before Jack came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I couldn’t really say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there a clock in Jack’s office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall ever looking at that clock while you were watching
television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; the clock wasn’t—It was one you had to wind, and it wasn’t
wound half the time. We didn’t pay any attention to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you ordinarily wear a watch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I didn’t, there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In the period before Jack Ruby came in, did you get a meal of
any sort, any food?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you and Andy discuss the events on television as you sat and
watched it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I imagine we did. I don’t recall saying anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did anybody come into the club before Jack arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall any of the female employees of the club arriving
at the club on the day, on the 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you think specifically about Tammi True, do you recall
if she came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you say you don’t recall, that is not the same as
saying that she didn’t come in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it that you would not make the statement, or would you,
that she didn’t come in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I would not make that statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about as to any of the other girls—Joy Dale, for example?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I wouldn’t make the statement of the fact that none of them
came into the club. I would say it was possible that any of them came into the
club, but I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, if any of them had stayed for any length of time, 5, 10
minutes, or more, do you think you would have remembered it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you don’t recall anybody coming in and staying as long as
10 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. When Jack came in and you people sat out at the
front of the club, how far were you seated from the telephones?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We was right beside the telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that the one near the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You would have been, then, about 10 feet away from the one at
the bar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, as you sat there with Jack, did you all sort of keep your
ears glued to the radio, or was there a general conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We was talking. We had the radio up loud enough so we
could hear, but we was talking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There was a continuous conversation, or were there long pauses
in the conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall. I don’t remember. We might have stopped,
we might just sat there 10 or 15 minutes at a time; I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. How long did Jack stay there with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember. It seems to me he was there probably a
couple of hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You think Jack was there a couple of hours with you in the
club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He might have been; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, while Jack was there, did you ever go back into his office
and watch television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe we did; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any recollection of how long you remained with
Jack in his office watching television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or how long it was after he came in that you went into his office
to watch television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. It seems to me like it wasn’t very long after he came before
we went back into the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any recollection of talking with Jack about the
dog that you were going to send to California?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not on that day, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If you had talked about that, would you remember it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I would have, I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Certainly the knowledge that the suspected killer of the President
of the United States had been in the Carousel where you worked would have
come to you as a pretty heavy shock; isn’t that a fair statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I suggest to you, then, that you can remember just when that
shock hit you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I can’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Isn’t it a fact, Larry, that you can tell us whether it came from
Armstrong definitely or that you just picked it up on one of these rides later on
because, as I say, it had to hit you and you admitted it was a shock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall whether you were alone with the person who told
it to you, or was anybody else present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember that, either, sir. Most of that day is very
vague in my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your best guess—that Andy Armstrong told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, if it had come from Andy Armstrong, it would have
made more of an impression on you than if it had come from some person who
had heard it as a rumor or over the radio, wouldn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, putting your mind to it in that way, can’t you help us a
bit more as to who actually told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I can’t. I have thought about it. I can’t recall exactly
who it was or exactly where it was I heard it. I believe it was before I
left Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And if it was before you left Dallas, you already told us it had
to be Armstrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I come to, in effect, the question I asked you this morning,
Larry. I don’t want you to feel bound by what you said at another time unless
it was the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I realize that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I suggest to you that the real motivation for leaving Dallas was
that you had found out that Oswald had been in the club, and that the matter
was getting a little too thick for you and you wanted out of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is not true?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; that is not true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say that is not true even if it is possible that Armstrong told
you that Oswald had been in the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right. If that is the case it was a subconscious thought.
It wasn’t conscious to where I would remember it. It would have been a subconscious
thought that it was the case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t understand you when you say it was a subconscious
thought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just that. It wouldn’t have been something that I thought
about for any period of time. It would have been something that I had heard
it and it just, I didn’t even think about it, and then subconsciously that could
have something to do with my leaving, but on a conscious level I will say no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, do you recall discussing it with this person who told you, in
any way, so that you ascertained from the person how they knew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had it been Armstrong wouldn’t you have asked him, “Well, how
do you know that, Andy? When did you see him? Where did you see him?
Who was he with?” You would have asked those questions, wouldn’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I would have asked him how he knew for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t recall asking the person who told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, if you had heard that from some of the people that
you had been riding with it would have had to be after Ruby had shot Oswald,
wouldn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; it seems so. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have known about
Ruby being involved with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is correct. But you didn’t find out about Ruby being
involved until Monday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Therefore, it had to be after that so far as you are concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right, if I wasn’t in Dallas. I believe that I heard the
statement before I left Dallas on the 23d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That being the case, unless you want to tell us some other things,
it had to be Armstrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right. That is all I can—I can’t say for sure who it
was, and I can’t even say for sure that I heard the statement before I left
Dallas. But I believe that it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall when it was that you first began to think about
this statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I can’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk with the people in Michigan, your relatives in
Michigan about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember, sir. I might have, with my sister, but I
don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You told me, I believe, in the automobile that you had not
been aware until I mentioned it to you in the car that Bill DeMar had made the
statement that he saw Oswald in the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you think, if someone had told you, one of your relatives or
somebody like that had told you, one of Ruby’s performers or somebody who
worked for Ruby had said that he saw Oswald there, do you think you would
have remembered that kind of information being conveyed to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I might have remembered something about the fact that one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
of them had said, that one of his employees had said, that Oswald had been
there; but I wouldn’t necessarily remember who it was who had said it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, if somebody said to you one of Ruby’s entertainers claims
he saw Oswald in the club, what would your reaction have been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It would have been <span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You didn’t know which entertainer it was or employee who
said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I wouldn’t really know whether it was true or not. I probably
would state the fact that I had never saw him there personally that I
knew of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me get through with this and see if this won’t help you out.</p>

<p>If you had heard this statement that Oswald had been in the Carousel, before
you knew that Ruby had shot him, that would have had one reaction on you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, that the man happened to be in the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If you had heard it after you knew Ruby had shot Oswald, I
suggest to you that that would have been an entirely different reaction, because
then it ties in Ruby and the club. Now doesn’t that assist you by
determining what your reaction was when you heard it, whether it was the
first type of reaction or the second type of reaction, or do you agree with me
that your reaction would have been different depending upon when you heard it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it would have been; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you accept my version that there would be two different
types along the lines I have said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I believe there would have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your reaction, the first or the second?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I can’t really remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Larry, when you talked with the FBI on Thanksgiving <span class="locked">Day——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I believe the FBI asked you did you know any connection between
Ruby and Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And I believe your answer at that time was that you did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you talked with the FBI were you being as frank and
straight-forward with them as you are with us right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; as much as I—to the best of my knowledge I told them
nothing but the truth the same as I am doing with you gentlemen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you mention to them that you then knew that someone had
told you that Oswald had been in the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe I did because I—I don’t believe I did. I didn’t
recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you stating to us that you would not have recalled a statement
made to you about Oswald being in the club, which statement had, by any
hypothesis, already been made to you, when they asked you if you knew of
any connection between them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The thing is that if I remembered it, I would have said so, told,
said something to them. If I didn’t say anything to them, I didn’t remember
the fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They asked you if you knew of any connection between them,
didn’t they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I believe they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you then knew that someone had told you he had been in
the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I believe they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why didn’t you tell them that you knew that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I evidently didn’t remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you have already stated that this thing made a great impression
upon you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I know that, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Larry——<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me follow this through a bit. Didn’t they, in fact, ask you
if you had heard the rumor that Oswald had been in the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know exactly how he asked me about it, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Didn’t he ask you, in fact, if you had ever seen him in the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he asked me that question; yes. I believe he might
have. My answer would have <span class="locked">been——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is your statement to us if he asked you that question it would
not have recalled to your memory that someone had told you that he had been
in the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. My statement is that it did not at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you a little bit frightened when the FBI talked with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you at all concerned that your flight from Dallas might
make you a suspect of some sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe—I don’t remember having any such belief; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was your feeling towards the FBI when they talked to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That they were talking to me because of the fact that I had
worked for Ruby, and they wanted to know what I knew about Ruby’s movements
in hopes that there might be something there that would help them in their
investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the time when you talked to the FBI you formed a tentative
opinion about the connection between Ruby and Oswald or the motivation for
Jack’s doing what he did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I figured, formed the opinion, myself, as far as I could figure
Jack must have been out of his mind to shoot Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this, would you say this was a strong opinion that you had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. I will say that it is the sort of opinion I have now, it has
been right along ever since I found out that Ruby had shot Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But in spite of having that opinion that there was somewhere
along the line you began to think if there could be any connection between
Ruby and Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I have considered the fact that there was a connection; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you start to think about this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I imagine I more likely thought about it as soon as I found
out or just shortly after I found out that Ruby had shot Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In trying to think about that connection, have you been thinking
about this rather regularly since then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. I have pretty well forgot just about, even, almost forgot
about it entirely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long would you say it has been that you have been—have
forgotten about any thoughts you might have had that there could be a connection
between Ruby and Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, I have just almost completely—I haven’t had a thought
about any of this since I appeared at the trial. I was of the opinion that I was
through with it and that I would just as soon forget about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about when you started to work in the oil field up there
in Michigan for the drilling company? At that time, did you ponder from time
to time whether there was any connection between Ruby and Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember doing so; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Keeping these sort of questions in mind, can you tell us when
it was before today that you first remembered that somebody might have told you
that Oswald had been at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I know definitely that I was told by somebody that Oswald
had been in the club, but I haven’t given that fact too much thought until we
was talking this afternoon during the lunch break there, and it seemed to me
the statement had been made to me before I left Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am asking you when you remembered that statement. Keep
in mind I am distinguishing between the time you actually heard the statement
made and when you first remembered it again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I remembered hearing the statement that Oswald had been
in the club, but I believe there was something in the news about the fact that
he had been in the club two or three times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Now, when you saw this in the news, did that bring
to you a recollection that someone had also told you this independently?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall it doing so; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, is it possible that the recollection that you are giving
us here is simply something that you really didn’t hear anybody tell you but
that you just read in the newspapers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It could be that it is mixed up in my own mind about the fact
that it come out that way, but I wouldn’t know for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are not sure now whether you independently remember
somebody telling you this or whether you just read about it in the newspaper,
and now are confused as to whether your source is from somebody telling
you or from the newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am almost positive that the statement was made to me by a
person, but it could have been that, like I say it could have been, after I left
Dallas, after it came out that Ruby had shot Oswald, somebody had heard the
statement over the television or read it in the newspapers themselves, and
made the statement to me that they had heard that he had been in the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I come back to the point I made a little while ago, and I would
like you to consider it again because apparently, as you say, you have not
given this matter a great deal of thought up until now. I suggest to you
again that your reaction when you heard it would have been quite different
if you had heard that rumor about Oswald being in the club before Ruby
shot Oswald than it would have been if you had heard it after he shot him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now that reaction of yours is, I think, the key to your recollection
of it, and I suggest that you put your mind to it, Larry, to see what—to
have a recollection, if you can, which is true, of course, but which will
reflect what your reaction was. It has got to be a different reaction between
the two, and I think you have agreed with me on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I do. I believe that—I am not sure whether it was
hearing a statement there when it was made to me or hearing it over the television
or something like that. It was something about the statement where
I said that if he had been I didn’t know about it, and I didn’t believe Jack did
either or something of that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, you are telling us then that at the time you heard
this you made a comment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You made a comment to the person who told you that Oswald
had been in the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And at the same time you made that comment that you hadn’t
seen Oswald in the club, you said you didn’t believe that Ruby did it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I didn’t believe that Ruby had saw him in the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That must have been then after Ruby was involved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It must have been; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would put it after Monday morning, November 25?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, according to that it couldn’t have been before you left
Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. According to that; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But do you still, in light of that do you still, have the recollection
that you did hear it before you left Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you this, Larry: If you had heard this before you
left Dallas, was your feeling nevertheless about Ruby’s insanity or state of
mind so strong at the point when you learned that Ruby shot Oswald that you
would have regarded such a statement as being of minimal importance or
was your initial reaction to Ruby’s having shot Oswald a sort of quizzical
one in which you really hadn’t made up your mind about the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. My original reaction when I first heard about it was the fact
I couldn’t really believe that he had done it. I just couldn’t believe, I couldn’t
make myself believe, that Jack had done it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why was that? Was there something about <span class="locked">Jack——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. From what I knew of him he didn’t strike me as the type
of person that would do so. I later made up my mind that, I come to the opinion,
if he had done it, if he had done it, he must have been insane when he had
done it, before I saw anything on television about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it then that your initial reaction that Jack couldn’t have
done this also reflected what you had seen of him on Friday and Saturday,
that he wasn’t in such—didn’t appear to you to be in such—a state of mind at
that time as being one who wanted to go out and kill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And who wasn’t so upset about the killing of the President that
he would be motivated by grief or something like that to do such a thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So you didn’t see him crying or weeping or emotionally, terribly
emotionally, upset about the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I didn’t actually see him crying. His eyes were very red
as if he had been crying the last time I saw him on Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or is that Saturday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Friday. But then again it struck me so hard that when I
finally realized that it really had happened, it struck me so hard, that I almost
cried myself. I believe there was a lot of people throughout the country, men
and women alike, that cried when they heard about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But still other than that reaction which you saw on Jack, there
seemed to be nothing about Jack that made him appear any more grief stricken
than any of the rest of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Jack the kind of a person who was given to concealing his
emotions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not so far as I know; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about concealing his hostility toward other people, did
you ever have any indication that he concealed his hostility toward other
people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. In fact, I would say it would be the other way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have any people that he regarded as enemies in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. One person that he absolutely didn’t have any liking for was
this one MC from one of the other clubs that come up there once in a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack display his feelings toward that guy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. On several occasions, on two or three occasions, he told the
guy he didn’t care to have him around the club, and he just as soon he didn’t
come to the club, and on one occasion he told the man to leave the club and
not to come back again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But after the man was out of his sight was Jack the kind of
person that he continued to talk about him and complain to the employees or
other people that he was with about somebody who was—about whom he was
annoyed or upset with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he went on for a few minutes about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack ever talk to you about his feelings toward his sister
Eva?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I can remember; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So you weren’t aware of any hard feelings between Eva and
Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about his feelings toward Abe Weinstein, the man who
ran the Colony Club, did Jack discuss those feelings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. From what I can remember any time Jack talked to Mr.
Weinstein they got along fairly good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So am I correct in understanding the way you describe Jack
when he had somebody that he didn’t like or had some hostility toward, that
he would only display this in the presence of that person in solving some
problem with the individual face to face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I believe so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me get back to the afternoon of the 22d again. What time
did Andrew Armstrong leave, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember the exact time; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Maybe 3:30, 4 o’clock, maybe a little later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he leave before Jack left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was after Jack left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you never saw him again really until you saw him in the
courthouse in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Later that night you were with Jack; weren’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As a matter of fact, everybody was reading, talking about Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not sure; sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Isn’t it a fact that Ruby had a paper, was reading a newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He more than likely did, but I don’t remember it, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you are aware that Oswald had shot the President or
that it was believed that he had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were talking with Ruby about the whole thing, weren’t
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I imagine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, if at that time you knew from Armstrong that
Oswald had been in the club, don’t you think you would have mentioned to
Jack, “Say, you know somebody says Oswald was in the club?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I believe I would have mentioned the fact that I had
been told that Oswald had been in the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does that help your memory as to when you got this remark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; it doesn’t. The fact it even makes me more positive that
it was after I left Dallas before I heard about it, because if I had said something
like that to Jack I believe I would have remembered it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I’ll tell you what I suggest you do, since the matter has
only been really brought to your attention in the last hour or so, you know,
I suggest that you give it some more thought and try to reconcile the different
possibilities that exist as to when this information came to you in light of the
questions we have asked you and the possibilities that have been expressed.
Would you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I have been doing so right along.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s go to something else, and we can come back to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I think it might be well to let it rest for a while. I am going
to hand you, Larry, a Xerox copy of pages out of the notebook, and I have
marked this “Washington, D.C., deposition C. L. Crafard Exhibit 5203, April 9,
1964,” and I am going to sign my name to it. Now, I want you to take this
Exhibit 5203 and look at those pages and leaf through it and tell me if you
have ever seen that before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There are nine pages in this one. I believe this is a notebook
that Jack carried in his pocket.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Crafard Exhibit No. 5203 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What makes you believe that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I recall seeing a notebook with these tear-out tabs on it that
he carried. I am not sure whether this is the one or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, this Xerox copy which I have handed you is marked on
the cover page “This is a Robinson Reminder.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then there are what you call tear sheets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What does the first one say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. “Jot it down....”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The second tear sheet, tear-out sheet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. “Do it....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The third?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. “Tear it out....”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And the fourth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. “Live notes only.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Those are all the tear-out tabs on what appear to be on the
front cover?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize the handwriting on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It is printing, and it is pretty hard to recognize it. I believe
this was Jack’s notebook. It is his handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You believe it is his handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is not the notebook, is it, that you transferred entries into
from your small Penway spiral notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; it is not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you believe Jack carried this notebook in his pocket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let us go through these entries and see if you recognize any of
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There are a few in there I know the names of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Sandy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That has no meaning to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The second entry is A. F. McKnight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Sue Pepper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe she had been a stripper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was she employed as a stripper while you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you heard some talk about her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The name sounds like one of the girls I mentioned as a stripper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Caroline Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Strike that. Jack Yanover?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Caroline Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Harold Tannebaum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Margaret Caldwell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is this Kirk Dial or Kirk Diaz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I would say Dial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. James Herbert?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Jules Herbert?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; not that I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you read what is written under Jules Herbert?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It looks to me like “Sherry care of Lincoln-Houston.” The
name “Sherry,” I believe she was a stripper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Gigi?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She was a stripper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But not employed there while you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. But not employed there while I was there. I have heard mention
of the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Wally Rack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t remember the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the Doctor’s Club, do you know what that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What does that appear to be, Linda Kubox?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I would say it looks like K-u-b-o-x to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear of that person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Betty Robbins?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Iwana Birdwell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Ferris?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Skip Hutcheson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe there was some, one young fellow that Jack had staying
there before I went there they referred to as Skip. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Skip Hutcheson you believe is the fellow who sort of performed
the job you did before you came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long before you came was Hutcheson there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it had been 2 or 3 months, I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It had been 2 or 3 months that had passed between the <span class="locked">time——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Lynd Chenalt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about W. O. Chenalt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It doesn’t mean anything to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is this Brenda?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It appears to be, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know a girl named Brenda there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t remember of any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And is that Augie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It looks like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know a fellow or a girl named Augie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; the name means nothing to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about John, is that Rogers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I would say so. It don’t mean anything to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Shirley Bruce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The name Shirley means nothing to me, but the last name would
have been Little Lynn’s correct name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, her correct name was Bruce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I thought her last name was Carlin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Her husband’s name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Bruce Carlin? Bill Willis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The name sounds familiar, but I can’t put any meaning to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he play in the band?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; he was one of the band players.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Gino Skaggs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Means nothing to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Dottie Walters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That means nothing to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Barbara Brown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That means nothing to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Tom Palmer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had been employed at the club. We received some letters
at the club for him. That is all I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What had been his employment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he connected with AGVA?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Sandra Moran?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is Kathy Kay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She was one of the strippers while I was there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And Andy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That would be Andrew Armstrong, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Andrea Dalk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The name means nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about this Kathy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember the name at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Lorri Womack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The name doesn’t mean anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Margaret?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It doesn’t mean anything to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Here is Judy Oberlin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. George, Sherman, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Betty Kelley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That doesn’t mean anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mike Eberhardt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It doesn’t mean anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Russ Knight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Russ Knight—that doesn’t mean anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Charles Senator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That doesn’t mean anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The House of Loan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It doesn’t mean anything to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Joe, Whitehall 2-5424?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It doesn’t mean anything to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Jeannie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Jeanine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Jeanine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She worked when I first went to work for Jack, she worked
as a cocktail waitress and then she also was an amateur stripper. She went
to work for Jack as a stripper while I was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What name did she strip under?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was under the first name of Jeanine. She used
a French last name. She was of French descent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Ralph Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Ralph Paul.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about American Airlines, and Tuesday, October 9, No. 985?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That would mean nothing to me. George Senator is the next
one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Of course, we have talked about George. Johnny Hayden?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Joy Herrod?</p>

while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Campbell-Corrigan, building repair. Did somebody do some
building repairs for him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember that. Corrigan, doesn’t mean anything to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Chuck Isaacs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It doesn’t mean anything to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Davis Kitter—something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Kitter something or other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It looks like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you don’t recognize that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Earl Wilson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Tammi True?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Of course, she was one of the strippers who worked for Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Here is Kay again, but you wouldn’t know what Kay that would
be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Nicki?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Carlos Camorgo, Mexico City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It doesn’t mean anything. The only thing I believe he had a
stripper, pictures of a stripper, from Mexico or South America, that he had some
papers from her indicating she had been there sometime in the past.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You believe he employed a stripper from Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She was either from Mexico or South America.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long ago had he employed this stripper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know how long ago. I saw some pictures with her name
on it, Spanish name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Billie?</p>

a stripper or a girl who went by the name of Toni Rebel on the stage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Bill Towney?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It doesn’t mean anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Affiliated Polygraph? That is a lie detector. Did
you ever hear anything from Jack on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The only thing I can think of there he had a sign there on the bar
that if anything come up of questionable or anything was stolen in the club or
anything all of the employees would be required to take a polygraph test. I
don’t know whether that was Affiliated or what.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he hang this out where the patrons could see it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was hung on the front of the cash register.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear of anybody being asked to take a polygraph
test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Margie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That would have evidently been Little Marge, the one waitress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Peggy Steele?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. She had been a stripper or was a stripper that had worked for
Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Henry Segel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He would—Segel as it is used there wouldn’t mean anything to
me. But the address he has got it, Chicago, Ill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know of a Segel that <span class="locked">Jack——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Spelled differently than that, Segal Liquor Store is where he
bought champagne and other wines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Dovie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What we have done is gone through all of the pages 1 through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
9 of Exhibit 5203, and we have read off every name that is in there. Now,
I am going to hand you what has been marked for identification as Exhibit
5204, and I have written on this, “Washington, D.C., deposition C. L. Crafard,
Exhibit 5204, April 9, 1964,” and I will sign this in pencil. Will you look at
that? It purports to be a notebook, and on the cover is simply the word
“Addresses.” It consists of 20 pages and, as I say, this is a Xerox copy of
the cover and those pages. Would you look at that and tell me whether you
have ever seen that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe this to be a copy of a notebook that Jack had, kept,
in his drawer in his desk.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Crafard Exhibit No. 5204 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that the notebook that you transferred items from your Penway
Spiral into?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So that the notebook which is represented by Exhibit 5203 you
believe Jack kept in his pocket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And this notebook, which is represented by Exhibit 5204, you
believe he kept in his desk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, or he might have kept in his pocket. He kept two or three
different books in his pocket at one time, but I believe that one was in his
desk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And he also kept on his desk a much larger Penway notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But he didn’t have the larger Penway notebook <span class="locked">until——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Until after I went to work for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was another one. The Penway notebook was about 6
inches long, and about 4½ inches wide.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, let us look at these names in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recognize any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don’t recognize a single name? Did you know Cecil
Hamlin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know what the Century Distributors, Inc., are?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Century Distributors, Inc.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; what are they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever know Jack to be interested in any prizefighters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; not that I knew of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear of a Willie Love?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember that name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear Jack talk of Lewis McWillie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. L. J. McWillie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever meet a fellow named Lawrence Meyers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever meet any of Jack’s friends from Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember when you were at the State fair ever meeting
any other people with Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember when the first time was that you met Joyce
McDonald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was at the fairgrounds. She came out with Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you meet her out there; did you meet any men out there
with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t—it seems like there was a couple of men with them, but
I was never introduced to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I will state for the record that this notebook which we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
consists of 20 pages and those 20 pages include the cover which is marked
“Addresses,” and that is page No. 1, and the remainder of the pages are numbered
consecutively through 20. I might also indicate that on each page of
this exhibit, with the exception of page 1 and page 20, two pages are photographed
open, so that would make a total of almost 40 pages of actual written
addresses. I hand you, Larry, what has been marked as “Exhibit 5205, Washington,
D.C., C. L. Crafard, April 9, 1964,” and I have put my signature on
there. This is a photograph of a group of people, and there is an arrow pointing
toward one of the people. First of all, can you tell us if you recognize
the place in which that photograph was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It appears to be the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Crafard Exhibit No. 5205 for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there anything about it that looks like the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. You can just see the portion of the runway across here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is in the lower left-hand corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Lower left-hand corner of the picture, and the Carousel was
the only club in Dallas to have runways, to seat the customers on runways.
These gentlemen are sitting right on the runway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you see anybody in that picture that you recognize?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t. I see one of the waitresses back in the background.
I can’t make out which one it is on the upper right-hand portion,
standing holding a tray, but I can’t make out who it is though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is an arrow directed toward one of the individuals in
that picture. Do you ever recall seeing that individual in the club before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t. I don’t recall seeing him at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that picture of yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; definitely not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why do you say definitely not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. One thing, the clothing. He is wearing a checkered shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Any time I was in the club I wore a suit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You always wore a suit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. I sometimes took my dress jacket off and put on a gold
livery jacket on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you ever dressed in a sweater of any sort there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you wear a tie while you were in the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. This gentleman is wearing what would appear to be a
sport shirt, and I would say he is an older gentleman than I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to hand you what I have marked for purposes of identification
as “Washington, D.C., C. L. Crafard. April 9, 1964, Exhibit 5206,”
and I have signed my name to it. Do you recognize the place where that photograph
was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Mostly on the stage of the Carousel Club looking down the
center runway.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Crafard Exhibit No. 5206 for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you see anybody in that picture that you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Excuse me; that is looking down the side runway on the left
side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize anybody in that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The young lady on the stage with her back to us, I believe, is
the stripper known as Tammi True.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Blond hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is—how about the man who appears to be dressed in a
tuxedo and standing on the stage; do you recognize him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He looks like the comedian known, that I can only remember
the name as, Johnny. He worked with a couple of puppets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize the man in the checked shirt?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Only from the fact that it was his picture in the—his photo
in the previous picture that was designated with an arrow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that an accurate, true and accurate, picture of what the
inside of the Carousel looked like at the time that you worked there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. From that angle; yes. If you like, I can explain what they
was doing when this picture was taken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you tell us what that depicts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It depicts the, what they call, raffling, you might say; they
give tickets out at the door, and then they spin a roulette wheel, and the man
with the numbers on the ticket that correspond with the ticket on the roulette
wheel wins the prizes. That is what they were doing at that time; giving away
prizes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do they give away prizes every night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; weekends mostly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about during the week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not too often. Sometimes they did. It depends on the size
of the crowd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did Jack get his prizes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he give away twist boards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He gave away twist boards, Rusty Warren records, two bottles
of champagne, Wilkinson sword-edged blades, and stuffed animals.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he give away all of those items every night they had a
raffle or different nights?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He would give whoever won their choice. They would have,
give away, three prizes each night, and everyone would have their choices out
of the prizes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to hand you what I have marked as “C. L. Crafard,
April 1964, 5207,” and I have signed my name to it. That is a photograph. Can
you tell me where that picture was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was taken in Mr. Ruby’s office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is the arrangement of chair and desk and what appears to be
a couch in the foreground the arrangement that existed at the time that you
worked there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. This couch here is part of a sectional that was turned
crosswise of the office, the other portion being against the wall on the left-hand
side of the picture, which is where you cannot see it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are the people in this photograph looking in the direction of
the TV camera, I mean of the TV set?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I would say the woman as I am looking at the left of the
picture, Joy Dale, is looking more in the direction than the rest of them, the
TV set in the corner over this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is a TV set as you look from Jack Ruby’s position
in the photograph. It would be off at the far wall in the left-hand corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. To the left of him; yes, it would be to his left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there a door shown behind Jack Ruby there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; that is the door connecting his office to what was my room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So, in order to get into your room, you had to walk through
Jack’s office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. I had a door off in the hall to my room, but this was a
connecting door from his office to my room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where is the door that enters Jack’s office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It would be almost immediately behind the girl on the right-hand
side, who is Little Lynn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that door sort of opened up through the middle of the wall
or at one end of the wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. More or less to the end of the wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let’s mark on there, then, Little Lynn on the side that she is
on, and Jack Ruby in the middle; I am marking this on the back. And Joy Dale.
Now, the background of this picture, there appear to be tacked up on the door
a number of papers. Was that customary?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had a lot of different papers tacked, fastened to the door
there, hanging on it. He had a couple of pegs in the door he put them on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of papers did he keep up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Mostly old bills and stuff like that that he just stuck up on kind
of a wire peg that he put them on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me show you what I have marked as Washington, D.C.,
C. L. Crafard, April 9, 1964, Exhibit 5208, and I have signed it. Was that
photograph taken at the Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. Do you want me to describe it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; would you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It shows Jack Ruby standing on the stage holding the mike
talking to the audience, and they are clapping him; applauding him, I should
say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember when that photograph was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember the date, but this photograph would have
been taken at the same time we had a photographer from a magazine taking
pictures. It would have been taken by him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How often did Jack M.C.; appear on stage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. One or two nights. I believe one evening, one or two evenings
we was without an M.C. and Jack done the M.C.-ing. It was a couple of
evenings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When there was ordinarily an M.C. there, do you ever recall Jack
going up on stage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. It wasn’t his custom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Looking at that picture, do you recognize anybody else in the
photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you want to look at what I have marked in the same
fashion Exhibit 5209, and tell me if you recognize anybody in there?</p>

<p>First of all, let me rephrase the question. Do you recognize where that
was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t. It wasn’t taken in the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you recognize anybody in the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. I would say this picture was taken in a place where the
theme was more or less western theme than anything else. I remember I
commented to the other gentleman when he showed me a picture, we were looking
at the costume she had on, wasn’t anything I remembered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to hand you what I have marked in the same fashion
Exhibit 5210. Do you recognize where that photograph was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. This photograph was taken in the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize who any people in those photographs are?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. A stripper. I don’t remember her name right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On the left-hand side, is that the same girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The same girl in another one of the photographs. It looks like
Tammi True.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There are dogs in that—dachshund dogs in that photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. These dogs belong to Jack Ruby. We placed them on the stage
as more or less the photographer was here, as more or less a photography stunt
more than anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were they regularly used in acts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; only on this one occasion they were used more or less like,
say, for a photographic stunt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you ever been up on the stage while the lights were on,
while an act was in progress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not while an act was in progress. Usually, during the roulette
wheel, I would put the prizes out and I’d take them off when it was over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would the stage be lighted in the same way for the drawing
of prizes as it would be when an M.C. was on stage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would only the stage be lit or would the patrons, the customer
area, also be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just the stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever have occasion to look out into the audience from
the stage when the roulette wheel, when the drawing, was in progress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could you see faces in the audience?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was pretty hard to make out any faces unless they were
sitting right next, and then you wouldn’t recognize them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Unless they were sitting right next to the runway of the stage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And there <span class="locked">were——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Excuse me a minute, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. You can just see a gentleman standing on the right-hand corner
of some of these photographs. This gentleman was the M.C. at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall who he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was Johnny. Yes; there is the box, one of his
boxes. It was Johnny, but I am not sure what his last name was. There is a
woman in one of these pictures; I believe I can just see myself, but it is not
clear enough to make out. I believe it is me standing there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This picture that you are looking at, this large photograph, is
actually a series of small photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It is actually a series of small photographs. It would be the
first and second photograph in the middle series of photographs where you
can just vaguely see me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I want to show you what I have marked in the same
fashion Exhibit 5211. Do you recognize any of the people in that photograph,
that set of photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There is Johnny on the stage, the first one in the first series. I
can see Johnny on the stage again.</p>

<p>The next one shows Johnny.</p>

<p>The next one shows Johnny and, I believe it is Tammi True.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who is the heavy man in the short-sleeved shirt that is shown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember his name. He was to the club on several different
occasions. He always sat in the same place because he was such a heavy
man nobody could get around him, such a big one.</p>

<p>In the middle series of photographs shows Tammi True in each of them.</p>

<p>And on the outside series of photographs is Little Lynn in Jack’s office holding
some stuffed animals.</p>

<p>The bottom picture on the right-hand series shows Johnny with one of his
puppets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you this about the fat man in the short sleeves. Was
he a friend of Jack’s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. They knew each other. They seemed to be friendly, always
talked, Jack would always speak to him when he came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you associate any name with this man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I can’t remember his name, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was his name in any of the names that we went through in the
notebooks today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember. I wouldn’t remember his name if I saw it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there anybody else who would know him? Would Andy
Armstrong know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Andy Armstrong would know him; yes. I believe that Andy is
the one that first told me his name and told me to always seat him in the same
place.</p>

<p>There was only one chair in the club that he could sit on and we had to go get
it all the time when he come in and put it in the place for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to show you what I have marked in the same fashion
Exhibit 5212, which is also a series of photographs.</p>

<p>Do you recognize any of the people in those pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The stripper is Little Lynn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In all of the pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the patrons? Do you recognize any of the patrons?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Only myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. This doesn’t look like me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; it is not me at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that you right there? You have indicated to me that your
photograph appears in a number of these pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And let me indicate that you are in the photograph in the upper
right-hand corner, and you are the man in a black suit who is seated second
from the left along the runway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And in the picture immediately below that you occupy the same
position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The picture immediately below that which is the third from the
top, on the right-hand side you occupy the same position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And the stripper is Little Lynn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then moving into the center set of pictures you appear in the
same position third from the bottom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And the same position at the bottom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, is this suit and dress that you show here, is that the way
you were normally dressed at the Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. These pictures were taken as a photographic stunt, also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. During the day, Larry, if you had occasion to go out of the
Carousel Club, were you also dressed in a suit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. During the day, up until about 5 o’clock, I was normally dressed
in a pair of white jeans, a long-sleeved shirt or a pair of corduroys as I was
usually working around the club and I didn’t care to wear a suit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to hand you what has been marked in the same fashion
Exhibit 5213.</p>

<p>Now, this picture was taken inside the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Will you look at these pictures and tell me looking at the picture
in the upper left-hand corner, who that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Johnny, the M.C. on stage with his three puppets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And in the photograph right below that there are two girls. Who
is the blond?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Kathy Kay and I believe Tammi True in the dressing room.
The next photograph is the same.</p>

<p>The next photograph is Tammi True on stage. Going to the middle of the
first photograph is Tammi True. The middle series is all Tammi True on stage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize any of the patrons in here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, I don’t; except on the top picture on the right-hand corner
shows the heavy set man we have mentioned before in the same position as before.</p>

<p>On the right-hand column it shows Kathy Kay on the top photo.</p>

<p>The next three photos are all pictures of Johnny with his puppets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would that Johnny, would his name be Johnny Turner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he the only M.C., the only man who was employed at the
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was the only M.C. employed at that time; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And the only other employees he had at that particular time
were strippers or entertainers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; strippers and the waitresses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So let me understand this. That while you were there, Billy
DeMar was employed there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Wally Weston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Johnny Turner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And anyone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that was all. I can’t remember who the M.C. was
when I first went to work for Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it a different one other than the three we have mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not sure. That is what I was trying to remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did these M.C.’s have a regular run of a prescribed number of
weeks that they would play?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; maybe they might come in for 2 or 3 weeks, or they might
be there for 1 week and then they might stay for 3 or 4 months. It would depend
on the contract that they signed with Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Buddy Heard ever come and appear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe he was ever there while I was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to show you what has been marked as Exhibit 5214
and I want to ask you if you recognize any of the patrons in those photographs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The heavy set gentleman that has been mentioned before is
in the second photograph in the left-hand series. He is in the first photograph
in the middle series. That is all. But other than that, I don’t recognize any of
the other patrons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to hand you now what has been marked as 5214-A
and all the markings are in the same fashion as the previous ones. Do you
recognize any of the patrons in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The patron in the second and third photographs on the right-hand
side looks familiar but I can’t place him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What I am handing you is Exhibit 5215 which is also marked
in the same fashion as the others. Do you recognize any of the patrons there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I show you Exhibit 5216. You will notice that this appears to
be the interior of a dressing room and there is some sort of a plaque on the wall
in the top two photographs in the center and the photograph in the lower right-hand
corner. Do you recall what that plaque is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you state whether that picture was taken at the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you recognize those as Carousel Club dressing rooms?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oh, yes. The dressing rooms have been redecorated since I
worked there, I know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did the dressing rooms look as they appear in that photograph
at any time while you were employed at the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe that is the dressing room of the Carousel. I
don’t remember this stuff along the bottom picture, the left-hand side of the
bottom picture in the left-hand column. The plywood door that is shown in
several pictures, I don’t recognize that as being of the dressing room at the
Carousel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to hand you what has been marked in the same
fashion as Exhibit 5217. Do you recognize the patron that is shown in that
photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, I don’t, but I believe from this picture I can pretty well state
that that other last picture was photographs of the girls’ dressing room, from the
location of the table. Instead of a door that was a window that had been
boarded up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I show you Exhibit 5218 which has been marked in the same
fashion. Do you recognize any of the patrons in that photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Exhibit 5219 which has been marked in the same
fashion? Do you recognize any of those patrons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Only that I believe this one has been showed in previous
pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is this a duplicate of something we already have?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe it is a duplicate, but I believe this gentleman
in the white shirt has been shown in previous pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about 5220? Do you recognize any of the patrons there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Only this one gentleman here. I can make him out especially
in the bottom picture in the middle column.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. With the white shirt on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The gentleman with the short-sleeved white shirt on I can
recognize him from the previous pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you don’t have a recollection of who he is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t have a recollection of who he is. I don’t think I ever
knew the gentleman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, Exhibit 5221, do you recognize any of the patrons in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Only the gentleman on the right-hand would be the back down
in the picture towards the right-hand side would be the far side of the stage the
heavy set gentlemen that has been mentioned before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever know a man named Bernard Weissman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear Ruby or anybody indicate that Officer Tippit
was ever in the Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember of hearing any indication.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about that Bernard Weissman? Was he in the Carousel
Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember any indication of that, either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you ever owned a gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I had a pistol, but it was in Oregon when I was in Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of a pistol was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. A .22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you ever owned any other sort of a gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you were in military service, did you have any training
with a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I had training with the M-1 rifle and with the M-1 carbine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you were in Dallas, Tex., did you ever have any occasion to
go out to any rifle ranges?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know whether Jack Ruby ever went to any rifle ranges?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Your answer is you don’t know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I did not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. While you were in Dallas, Tex., did you attempt to purchase an
automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you visit any used car lots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever drive Jack Ruby’s car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you drive an automobile at any time while you were in
Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever accompany anybody in an automobile to have
it repaired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I believe when you talked with the FBI, you indicated
that you visited a store with Jack where he was going to get some electrical
or electronic equipment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How soon was that after you began to work for Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I think it was about 3 or 4 weeks after I went to work for Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you talk about working for Jack, do you mean that to include
the time that you were working at the Dallas, Tex., State Fair?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As working for Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Only the time, from the time the State fair closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what kind of electrical equipment Jack was purchasing,
looking for when you went with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Some speakers and—that is the boxes that are used to work a
speaker out of, the amplifier box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was he going to use these items?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. In the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had he had those items there before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had the items in the Carousel Club, but he was going to
replace them with some better models.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were his existing models defective in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was always something going wrong with one speaker or
the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he actually replace these?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not while I was there; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What happened at the electronics store that you visited?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He talked with the gentleman for a few minutes and I believe
he give them a free pass to the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did he do in connection with buying equipment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had checked out some equipment they had there, their prices,
the types of equipment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What price range of equipment was he talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was wanting to get a better model amplifier as cheaply as
he could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would this have been an expenditure of over $100?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I really don’t know, but I don’t believe so. Could I go back a
little bit to the day. I believe that was about a week after I went to work for
Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now you testified yesterday I think that the girl whom you
identified in some pictures taken on the street outside the Carousel with Jack
Ruby, you identified this girl as Gloria McDonald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could her name have been Gloria Fillmore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Her name could have been, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you sure about the name McDonald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. In fact if I may be allowed to say so, I am not positive
that this girl is the girl I knew as Gloria. Her name could have been something
entirely different. I believe it was Gloria.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You believe it was Gloria in this picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you are not completely positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. I never knew her last name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me try to refresh your recollection a little bit. Going back
to Wednesday, November 20, 2 days before the President was killed, and Thursday,
November 21, do you remember on either of those 2 days receiving any
telephone calls from Bruce Carlin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe Bruce called the evening of Wednesday, the 20th
wanting to speak to Little Lynn. I am not positive but I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now how about on the 21st. Do you remember anything on the
21st?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall anything, no. He might have but I don’t recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you ever remember on the 21st a telephone call being placed
to Jack Ruby in the early portion of the evening, and your answering the phone
and talking to the person on the phone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember it, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Bruce Carlin ever have occasion to call Jack Ruby in your
recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember him ever doing so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever meet any of Bruce Carlin’s friends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever meet a boy named Jerry Bunker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember it, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Bruce used to call the Carousel regularly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. There was only one or two occasions when I am sure that
Bruce called the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When are the other occasions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was the evening of Wednesday the 20th Little Lynn
hadn’t went straight home from the club and he called asking, wanting to know
where she was at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any idea of the financial condition of Little Lynn
or Bruce Carlin the week before the President died?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Little Lynn ever complain in your presence about not having
enough money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that when she first went to work for Jack, Jack either
gave her an advance or loaned her some money, one or the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I recall yesterday in your talking with Mr. Hubert there was
some problem you felt that you had lost 8 hours in describing what happened
on your trip from Dallas to your destination in Michigan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In the time that has passed since then, have you been able to
find those 8 hours that were lost?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Pretty well, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What do you think happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I got mixed up on my routes in Oklahoma City and spent quite
a bit of time getting back. There is where I lost the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About what time did you arrive in Oklahoma City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was about 7 o’clock in the evening of the 23d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how did you happen to get mixed up on your routes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I got a ride with this gentleman and I believe he said something
about getting me out on my route or something like that, and I got mixed up
on my route.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ride with him in the wrong direction for a while?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He took me out, he took me quite a ways more than where I
had to go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On that basis what time would you say that you arrived in
Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It probably would put me in Chicago sometime Monday, about
10:30 or 11 o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you arrived in Chicago, then you knew that Ruby had
killed Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what time did you arrive in Lansing, Mich.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was about 6:30 or 7 o’clock Monday evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you arrived in Chicago did you make any effort to call any
of the Rubensteins?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did that occur to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; that arrival in Lansing would have been about 3:30 or 4
o’clock. It would have been a couple hours earlier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You mentioned that the ride that you had got out of Dallas on the
23d with a man whom you had met at the Dallas State Fair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did he do at the Dallas State Fair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was a photography place on the fairgrounds. He worked
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he a full-time employee at the fairgrounds or was this a
temporary thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe this was just temporary for the fair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was the name of the photography place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember that, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there a number of different photographers at the fair?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe there was two or three different ones at the fairgrounds.
This one was right close to the place I worked was located.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How far would it have been from a tent? Were you in a tent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How far would it have been from your tent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. About 150 or 200 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In which direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It would have been down on the main midway. It would have
been right on a corner of the main midway and the portion of the midway I was
on. We were located on a branch off the main midway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How old would you say this man was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I would say he was probably in at least his middle forties, more
likely in his late forties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he bald or did he have hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t really remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he a graying man or what color was his hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember that either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember if he wore glasses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember what kind of a car he owned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he had a Chevy. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How would you describe his physical build, anything remarkable
about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; not that I could think of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he a thin man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He was about medium build for a man his age and height.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you say he had a young boy with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; he had a son about I believe 9 or 10 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you catch the son’s name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about his name? Did you learn his first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I more than likely knew his name but I don’t remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did he do at the photography studio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know for sure just what he did do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this a Dallas studio that had a place there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there some central office of the Dallas State Fair that would
keep records of the people who had charge of tents or booths there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That would be the fair commission would know anyone that had
any kind of a stand or concession on the midway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And where would this commission have its office when the season
was not in session?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It would be on the fairgrounds. I am not sure where though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is some sort of permanent office there on the fairgrounds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; the Dallas Fairgrounds is one of the largest fairgrounds in
Texas. It is open the year around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It is your belief that this man knew you worked for Jack Ruby as
he was taking you out of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not until after we had got to talking and I told him I had been
working at the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long would you estimate that you were with that man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oh, maybe a half hour or maybe 45 minutes at the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And it is your belief that he had a cottage at some sort of a lake?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t remember the name of the lake he lived on, that he had
his cottage on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you remember somewhat where he left you off and in what
direction he had to turn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he went to the left of 77 when he let me off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You left Dallas on route 77?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how far would you say you went on route 77?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. We were about 20 miles outside the city limits of Dallas at
Carrollton, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He let you off in Carrollton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just the other side of Carrollton a little ways.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. North of Carrollton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just north. Not very far. It couldn’t have been more than
maybe a mile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this some sort of main intersection he let you off at?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so, yes; the main entry for the Carrollton traffic on the
north side of town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You were at route 77 and the corner of some other road?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was just one of the so-called farm roads of Texas.
They have got a lot of the roads numbered farm road such and such.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there a sign up there that pointed to a lake that this man had
to turn to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you get any idea how large a lake it was? Was it a resort
area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recall that either, sir. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you do recall that the man had a cottage or something of
that sort on the lake?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; he was going up to work on his cottage when he picked me
up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We talked at lunchtime about a man who called the Carousel
during the week before the President was assassinated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And would you tell us about these calls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Is that the one where I said he wouldn’t give his name or
anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is the one I had in mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. This gentleman would call maybe two or three times a day
asking for Jack. He would ask where he could reach Jack. It sounded like it
was pretty important that he reach Jack, and that he would never leave a number
where Jack could call him back at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever give this man a number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I can recall, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what time of the day or night this man would call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It would usually be during the day. I can’t recall any specific
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did this man ever wake you up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; it was always well after 9 o’clock, I know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did it ever appear to be around lunch hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It could have been anywhere from 9 o’clock to 6 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he seem to call at regular times when he called?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you describe his voice in terms of age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I couldn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did this man call on Friday, November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t really remember whether he did or not. I don’t
believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about on the morning of the 23d, Saturday the 23d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he call the day before the President was assassinated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he called sometime in the afternoon of the 21st.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever talk to Andy Armstrong about this man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I said something to Jack about him and I believe Andy
was there when I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what did you say to Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That this guy called several times wanting to get a hold of him,
would never leave his name or address or number or anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did Jack say to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Jack had told me previously not to give his number to anyone
unless I knew who it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is his home number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, or some other number he left where he could be reached at.
He said not to worry about anybody that didn’t leave a phone number, they
didn’t want to get in touch with him very bad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he indicate that he knew who this man was who was calling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I took it for granted he knew who the man was. He never
said definitely that he did know who the man was. I think when I told him about
it he just said forget it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You never met this man, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; if I had met the man I would have known his voice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many home telephone numbers did Jack have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He only had one home number that I knew of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack have an assistant manager by the name of Alexander?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That would have been Andrew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I think we can finish a good part of this today if we could take
a break. I want to hand you a copy of your interview with the FBI and ask you
to take time to read that over. It is rather lengthy. It covers eight pages.
Make some notes. Let me put this on the record. Let me ask you to take your
time and read this, and we will take a recess for as long a period as you feel
necessary. Make notes as you go along of any changes that you think ought to
be made, either because you didn’t tell that to the FBI or because you now upon
reflection think that it is inaccurate, or because after reading this and reflecting
on your other testimony you would adopt this rather that what you have said
before. Let’s figure this will take at least 15 minutes and maybe longer.</p>

<h3>TESTIMONY OF CURTIS LaVERNE CRAFARD RESUMED</h3>

<p>The testimony of Curtis LaVerne Crafard was taken at 9:50 a.m., on April 10,
1964, at 200 Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C., by Messrs. Burt W.
Griffin and Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President’s Commission.
Dr. Alfred Goldberg, historian, and Max Phillips, Secret Service, were present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me state first for the record that this is a continuation of
the deposition that was begun on Wednesday morning, April 8, with Mr. Crafard,
and that the oath and all the formalities that we went through on that date
are still in effect. Yesterday afternoon as Mr. Crafard and I were returning
from lunch, he indicated to me that he had received some telephone calls at
the Carousel Club in the week before President Kennedy was killed, from a
man who would call two or three, perhaps more times a day but would not
leave his name but simply ask for Jack Ruby, and in connection with that
conversation Mr. Crafard asked me if we had any recordings of Lee Oswald’s
voice. Mr. Crafard indicated that he would like to listen to the recordings
with the possibility that he might recognize the voice of somebody he had
talked to or overheard when he was in Ruby’s employ. We have located a tape
recording of an interview which was conducted with Mr. Oswald in New
Orleans shortly after he was arrested for disturbing the peace in connection
with the Fair Play for Cuba activities. The tape recording was made by
radio station WDSU, New Orleans on August 21, 1963. The recording involves
Lee Harvey Oswald, Carlos Bringuier, Ed Butler, and Bill Stuckey. The
recording is provided to us by the United States Secret Service. It bears
Secret Service No. 236.</p>

<p>I would also like to explain for Mr. Crafard’s benefit as well as the rest of
us that it will be very clear as you listen to this tape recording which person
on the recording is Lee Oswald. In some cases his name may be used. In
other cases the question and answer repartee is such that it will be difficult
not to realize who Oswald is if you know anything about Oswald’s background.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
There also may be a certain amount of distortion in the recording and we are
not able to state for the record at this time exactly how much distortion there
is and how this would compare favorably with what might heard over a
telephone. I would like you to keep all of this in mind in listening to this
and try to give us as accurate a recollection as you can of whether you have
ever heard this voice which will appear to be Oswald’s.</p>

<p>Mr. Hubert, do you have anything you want to add?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, it is just another way of putting what Mr. Griffin has
said, we don’t want you to identify a voice simply because it is suggested to
you by the content of the material. If that would be the basis of your recollection—of
your recognition it would be of no value to us, you see. On the
other hand, if you do recognize the voice we expect you to tell us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Dr. Goldberg, do you have anything you would like to ask?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goldberg</span>. No; I have no questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Phillips, if you would go ahead and commence the recording
we will all listen to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Phillips, you are going to be able to tell us after we finish
playing that at what point you began and at what point you ended?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phillips</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Might I ask the reporter if it is possible for him to take down
the first couple of sentences so we will have for the <span class="locked">record——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t think it will be necessary if we can get into the record
its being at such a point in feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you indicate to use what the footage is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phillips</span>. I have the index at zero right now with the paper index in the
reel. When it is through I will be able to know how much, what the index reads
and I will have a paper index in the other roll and that space in between is
what we have played. I will identify that section.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. May I suggest, though, Mr. Hubert that if there is any possibility
that portions of this tape might be deleted or retranscribed onto another
tape that it would probably be best if we did have an indication of the opening
words that are on here so that it can be located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is an extra precaution.</p>

<p>(The tape recording commenced with the following):</p>

<p>“What price in dollars of Cuba selling sugar to Russia, Russia sending to
Cuba 80 percent in machinery in Russia and 20 percent in dollars,” et cetera,
et cetera, et <span class="locked">cetera——</span></p>

<p>(This is a Cuban or Spanish speaking voice.)</p>

<p>“Could you straighten out that point, are you or have you been a Communist?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I am a Marxist.</p>

<p>“What is the difference.</p>

<p>“Well, the difference is primarily the difference between a country like Ghana,
Guiana, Yugoslavia, China, or Russia.”</p>

<p>(End of transcription.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you tell us now, Mr. Crafard, whether after listening to
this recording you recognize any of the voices on the recording?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Phillips, I want the record to show where you began and
where you left off and we have the double check with the opening sentences
of the excerpt and the closing sentences so that we may have a mechanical
check as well, would you state for the record precisely how this can be identified
at a later point in time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phillips</span>. This section of the tape can be identified by paper index tabs
which have been inserted. Secondly, the index numerical index reads 163 on
this stereophonic concord tape recorder. The numerical index reads 163 which
means from the time the tape was played which was on zero index, the tape distance
went 163 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Those paper tabs are temporary, aren’t they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phillips</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there a possibility of marking the tape in some way without
injuring it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phillips</span>. There would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that there would be a permanent mark as to where the paper
tabs were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phillips</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you do that by making some sort of significant mark
with your initials?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phillips</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. We will ask you to do that also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Phillips</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Larry, did you recognize anyone of the voices in that
excerpt that we played?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have never heard them at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you are certain that it is not the voice of the man who
called Ruby that you referred to yesterday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. How is that now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yesterday I understand that you referred to the fact that a
man had called Ruby by telephone on a sufficient number of occasions so that
you believe that you could recognize his voice if you heard it again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I will ask you if any of the voices that you heard in this
excerpt just run off on the machine is the voice of the man you were talking
about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Larry, having had a chance to listen to a number of voices
on the tape recording is there anything you can tell us about the voice of the
man who called you without leaving his name that Mr. Hubert has been referring
to. Did he have an accent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; he didn’t have an accent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he speak with any characteristic Texan or southern speech
patterns?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; his voice sounded more like a person from the East would
talk. His words were very pronounced and very definite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is one photograph that I neglected to show you yesterday
which I want to show you now and ask you to identify.</p>

<p>I am going to mark this Washington, D.C., April 10, 1964, C. L. Crafard,
Exhibit 5222.</p>

<p>(Photograph marked Crafard Exhibit No. 5222 for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you look at that photograph and tell me if that is a
photograph of anyone you have ever seen before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I have saw the gentleman before at the club but I
don’t believe I was ever introduced to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall in what connection you saw him in the Carousel
Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he was a guest of Mr. Ruby’s.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall when you may have seen him there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to hand you what I have marked as Exhibit 5223
which is a photograph of a piece of paper and it bears the name T. E. Smith,
and there is some other writing under it. Do you recognize that name on that
sheet of paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This exhibit is marked Washington, D.C., April 10, 1964, C. L.
Crafard Exhibit 5223 and it bears on the back the numeral one.</p>

<p>(Photographs marked Crafard Exhibits Nos. 5223 and 5224-A for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to hand you what I have marked as Washington,
D.C., April 10, 1964, C. L. Crafard Exhibit No. 5224-A and I will ask you if you
will tell us what those are a picture of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. They are pictures of a message, I would say that—there is
space for who the message is to, the date, who it is by, and when they were
there and the phone numbers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are there three message slips photographed in that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you ever recall seeing those around, such message slips
around, the Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you ever recall seeing those in any connection with Mr.
Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize the handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is on there. Do you recognize any of the names on those
sheets of paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. None other than the name Ruby here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall whether Mr. Ruby received telephone calls regularly
at any phone other than the phone at the Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He might at his home address. I wouldn’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you look at what I have marked in the same fashion as
Exhibit 5224-B and tell me if you recognize any of the names that are shown
in that photograph?</p>

<p>(Photograph marked Crafard Exhibit No. 5224-B for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The middle one in the picture bears the name Pauline which
is the name of the assistant manager of the Vegas Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know whether there was somebody who stayed throughout
the day at the Vegas Club in the same manner that you stayed throughout
the day at the Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to show you a series of photographs all of which are
marked Washington, D.C., April 10, 1964 and which I am going to mark Exhibit
5225. Each of these 19 photographs has in the upper right-hand corner on the
reverse side of the photograph a letter in sequence from A to S. I would like
you to look at all 19 of these photographs and tell me if you recognize the notebook
which they purport to depict.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe these to be a notebook that Jack Ruby used.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where would you recall seeing that notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he carried it on his person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yesterday you identified two other notebooks one which you
thought he kept on his person, the other which you thought he kept in his desk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Having seen this is there—would you change your testimony
any way about the other two notebooks that you identified yesterday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So it is your testimony that Jack maintained at least three small-sized
notebooks that you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had several of them, two or three of which he carried on
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to state for the record that these photographs do not
have the normal commission number that is put on documents when they come
into the office. These photographs at this time have come to us by a letter from
the Federal Bureau of Investigation dated April 7, and the letter indicates that
this notebook was found in Jack Ruby’s automobile.</p>

<p>I will identify this notebook further as having on the front cover the word
“Alladin”. The notebook appears to be a pocket-size notebook which might be
2 by 3 inches or 1½ by 3 inches.</p>

<p>Under the word “Alladin” there is a triangle with some writing which I am
unable to read. Under the triangle, on the cover is written notebook No. 3164.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had better identify that picture you hold in your hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The picture I am referring to here is Exhibit 5225-A. The one
refers to the number that the Bureau has put on in the upper right-hand corner
on the reverse side. I am going to ask you to look at these photographs in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
sequence if you will look at Exhibit 5225-B, will you tell me whether you recognize
any of the names written on there?</p>

<p>(Photographs marked Crafard Exhibits Nos. 5225-A through 5225-S for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The name Pauline is on this page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize the name Milt Jaffe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe the name Bonnie also appears on this, that would be
the last name on this page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. State what you understand—you are looking through a magnifying
glass now at photograph number one, in the series of Exhibits 5225 and
there is a name on there that you believe to be Bonnie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me state for the record that as I look at it it appears to
be Barney, but assuming that it is Bonnie, that is—is that name familiar with
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Bonnie, a girl was—a girl by the name of Bonnie worked as
a waitress at the Carousel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about any of the other names on that page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The name Pauline mentioned before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Correction for the record, we are looking at photograph B
in the 5225 series.</p>

<p>Would you look at photograph C in that series and tell me if you recognize
any of the names on there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. This photograph doesn’t contain any names. It has something
to do with taxes, admission tax.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what Jack Ruby’s practice was while you worked
with him as to keeping track of taxes and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. On this admission tax we had some numbered tickets. When
each customer came in we tore one in half, tore half of the tickets and gave
them half of the ticket and once a month they would go at it and count the
tickets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall where he kept his records for those things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know where he kept his records at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall his making entries in a small notebook for such
records?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; not on the admission tickets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have some sort of other book that he kept his tax records
in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe his accountant kept most of the tax records but there
was something about the admission tax where him, Ruby and Andy would
work on that together and count the stubs.</p>

<p>But I don’t know where he kept record of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was the admission charge to the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Two dollars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was <span class="locked">it——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. This was including the taxes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that $2 every night or was there a different charge on
weekends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Two dollars every night at the Carousel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was his charge for admission at the Vegas, if there was
any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that was 75 cents or 85 cents, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you look at photograph D?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is another State admission tax note. July, August, and
September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is Exhibit D of Series 5225.</p>

<p>I want to show you E of Exhibit 5225. There are some names written
down there.</p>

<p>Do you recognize those names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Billy Brook, I have heard his name mentioned, I believe he
was a comedian; I am not sure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
There is Bobby Patterson. I have mentioned him as a band member for the
Vegas Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is a notation under the name Bobby Patterson. Would
you read that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Right under the name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I can’t make it out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To the right of the name there is a 6 with two zeros, and right
under the name Bobby Patterson it says, “and friends” and on the same line
to the right of the words “and friends” and under the 600 it says “10” with two zeros.</p>

<p>Do you recognize—does that mean anything to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize that handwriting that is shown there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I’m not positive, but I believe it is in Mr. Ruby’s handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall the way Mr. Ruby made notations about money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. This is his method of making notations with the 10 large and
two zeros small on the upper portion of the line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there anything else about that writing which makes you think
that is Jack Ruby’s writing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The fact that it is fairly small. And there is the name Armstrong,
the next name that I recognize, Andrew Armstrong. That is all there
is on that page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you look at photograph F and tell us if you recognize
anything on that photograph. This is of Exhibit 5225.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. What I recognize is really small writing down almost to the
bottom of the page, there are three lines right close together. The names and
phone numbers, the name Ruth Shay, I have heard the name, I can’t recall
exactly what her relation was, and the name Pauline again and then Tex
De Lacy, I believe I had his name and phone number wrote down in my notebook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you look at photograph G and tell us if you recognize
any of the names there or any of the notations that are on there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Other than the fact that it is apparently for excise tax purposes
for the Carousel Club, that is all I can say about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you look at photograph H. Do you recognize any of
the names or notations on that photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. This shows two pages and one page is excise tax for Carousel
Club. The other page has very little writing on it.</p>

<p>The name Joseph Rossi. I have heard Jack use the name Rossi quite a few
times, but I don’t know what it was about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is Joseph R-o-s-s-i?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you look at photograph I in this series that we have
been looking at and tell me if you recognize any of the names and notations there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The name Tom Palmer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You already testified about him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I already testified about Palmer and the other page has the
words revenue from the Vegas Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you look at photograph J and tell us if you recognize
any of the names and notations there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There is one name on here, I believe I heard Jack mention, but
I am not sure. This Rocky Robinson, I am not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any recollection as to the context or connection
that you may have heard that name used?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he introduced me to a man named Rocky, but I can’t
recall the last name of the gentleman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you look at photograph K and would you tell us if
you recognize any of the names and notations there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. None except for the insignia of KLIF Station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize the Serv-U Pharmacy as being a business in
Dallas?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you look at photograph L and tell us if you recognize
any of the names and notations there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. This is a repetition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is a duplicate photograph of the same picture that we
showed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As 5225-K.</p>

<p>Would you look at M in this series of photographs and tell us if you
recognize any of the names and notations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There is the name Jeanine, Tammi, Lynn that I recognize,
Brother Bear.</p>

<p>The name Norma, I believe is the same phone number as I give for Miss Norma
Bennett, or Barnett.</p>

<p>I believe there is a Bob Litchfield, I believe that is the last name on there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Those are all names that you testified about previously?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so. I am not sure about that Litchfield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize the name Bertha Cheek that appears on there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you look at N in this series of photographs and tell
us if you recognize any of the names and notations there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you look at photograph O in the series and address yourself
to the same questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t recognize any that is on here. There appears to be the
word “taxes”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Will you look at P and tell us if you recognize any of the
names and notations there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There is the words Morning News, Carousel rent and something
about the laminating company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do those—can you tell whose handwriting those notations are in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe they are in Jack’s handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it Jack Ruby’s practice to make notes for himself of things
he had to do any particular day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know for sure whether he did or not. On one or two
occasions I have saw him make notes of things he wanted to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you look at Exhibit Q and tell us if you recognize any
of the names or notations there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Mike Shore.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You testified about him previously.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so; yes.</p>

<p>There is Ed Pullman’s name on there. I have testified about him previously.</p>

<p>And Joe Williams, I believe from the band at the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to direct your attention back again to photograph P
in this series, Exhibit 5225. There is a notation on here “baby bottle.” Do you
have any idea what Jack Ruby would have had to do with any baby bottles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t, whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On Exhibit Q in this series, 5225, there is a notation “Goodwill
Industries”. Did Jack—do you remember having anything to do with Goodwill
Industries?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Except the fact that most of my clothes were bought there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The name Dalton appears in connection with that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he spoke with Mr. Dalton in connection with trying to
get the Goodwill Industries interested in the twist boards, their manufacture,
I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is also a notation after the word “Mike Shore” appears
to be the word “blades”. Did Mike Shore have anything to do with the Wilkinson
blades that Jack gave away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I know of; not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is also a notation on here that appears to read “Stubbe
Machine”, some sort of machine that looks like Stubby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The only thing I could say with that it might be in connection
with the laminating machine that he was thinking about getting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, now, tell us about the laminating machine that he was
thinking about getting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. These free passes he was giving out he was having them laminated
in plastic and he was thinking about getting a machine to do it himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was he intending to purchase this machine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. These were free passes to the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did the practice of giving passes away to the Carousel exist all
the time you worked for Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He started that practice just after I went to work for him,
giving them to people that he had business with, personal acquaintances, and
different important businessmen from different areas of the country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever talk to Andy Armstrong or Jack so that you would
be able to state whether he had given away passes prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. To my—as far as I know, he had never given them away before
this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize the name Monte that appears on this photograph
Q in the 5225 series?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember the name of a fellow by the name of Monte
Timmons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe I ever met the man. I don’t remember the name.</p>

<p>Excuse me 1 minute.</p>

<p>I believe that is a woman’s name. There was a woman by the name of Monte,
had a phone call, had Ryan call her back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mike Ryan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to show you photograph R and ask you if you recognize
any of the names or notations there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Bill Petty’s name is on there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he was a friend of Jack’s. I met him at the Carousel
Club. Jack introduced me to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he live in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know what he did? How often did you meet him at the
Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he was there two or three times while I was working
for Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would he come during business hours or would he come in the
afternoon, or morning, when there weren’t patrons there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe when I first met him was in the afternoon, but other
than that it was during business hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know what the nature of Jack’s connection with Petty
was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>There is the name Gladys. I spoke of her before.</p>

<p>And this Dr. Uhleviteh was Mrs. Grant’s doctor.</p>

<p>The name Oscar Newman seems familiar, but I don’t recollect what there was
about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There appears to be an abbreviation for Mrs. written above
Oscar Newman, does that mean anything to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I will hand you photograph S in this series we have been
looking at. Do you recognize any of the names there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Little Lynn’s name is on there.</p>

<p>There is the name Gloria with the last name of R-e-t-t-i-g, the last name doesn’t
mean anything to me. The first name was the same as we have mentioned before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is Vicky Williams a name that you recognize?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yesterday I gave you a copy of the FBI report of its interview
with you. Did you have a chance to look that over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As a result of having read that interview, are there any changes
or corrections that you desire to make in that interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Mostly were minor changes. One was the spelling of my wife’s
maiden name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How should that be spelled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It should be spelled with a “P” instead of an “O” there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you take my pen and correct that and then initial it and
date it where it appears in the interview?</p>

<p>I am going to mark this exhibit, “Washington, D. C., April 10, 1964. C. L.
Crafard, Exhibit 5226,” and I am going to sign my name to the bottom of the
first page.</p>

<p>(The document was marked Crafard Exhibit No. 5226, for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I have made this notation on the first page of what purports to
be an FBI report of an interview with Mr. Crafard, the interview having been
conducted on November 28, 1963, at Bellaire, Mich., by Special Agent Theodore
S. Kramer, K-r-a-m-e-r, dictated November 29, 1963.</p>

<p>There are eight pages to this report and at the bottom of each page there is
a number beginning in sequence with the number 147 and continuing through
the number 154 on the last page.</p>

<p>I am going to put my own initials on pages 148 through 154.</p>

<p>You have made your first correction of the name of your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On the first page of this Exhibit 5226?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, are there any other changes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes, the date of our wedding instead of the 16th of June was the
22d of June.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are correcting that in the same fashion that you made of the
other correction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. The fact he stated here almost every hour Ruby was
asking about calls. Called between one and three times a day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let’s make a correction on there, then, if this is agreeable to you
the sentence reads, “other than that Ruby would telephone I call, I contact him
almost every hour for any calls.”</p>

<p>After the word “contact him” why don’t you cross out the remainder of the
sentence and then make a correction in your handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. “almost every hour.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are crossing out “almost every hour” and you are going to
write something in there.</p>

<p>He has written on here “one or two times” but he spelled day “b-a-y” and he
has put his initials CLC with the date 4-10-64. He has crossed out the words
“almost every hour.”</p>

<p>Are there any other additions or corrections?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe there were a couple of small minor changes in there.
This about Ruby kept the revolver when he had money. There was only one
occasion when he would take the revolver from the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Well, we will have to change that, then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. With this, I can go back and name the one MC I have mentioned
and I couldn’t think of his name, Bill Norman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, you have referred to this sentence: “He said
that when transporting money Ruby kept his money in the trunk with the
revolver and always kept the revolver with him when moving money.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you want to cross out everything after the phrase “with
the revolver”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And if you want to add anything, state something to the effect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
that, as you have just told me that on one occasion you recall him having the
revolver with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. On one occasion I know of him having the revolver with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is the correction you have made on the paper.</p>

<p>Let me ask you a few questions here, Larry.</p>

<p>Is the one occasion that you are referring to the time when he asked you to
go down and get the revolver for him, or are you talking about another occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There was one other occasion when he brought the revolver
into the club and it stayed there all evening, when he stayed in the club, and
when he left he took the revolver with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember when that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that was about a week and a half before the assassination
of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What makes you remember that episode?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I was trying to remember as much as I can about it, and I
remember taking the revolver to him helped me remember the fact that he
had it on one occasion with him in the club before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there anything that he did or said which gave you any
indication of why he had the revolver with him in the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I believe he had money in the same sack with the revolver,
and he just brought it in all together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have a safe in the club at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; but he didn’t use it very often. I believe he had it.
I believe he had it at that time; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You testified before that it was Jack’s practice either at the
end of every business day or the next day to pick the money up and take it
away from the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On how many occasions would you say you were present when
Jack, when you saw Jack take money away from the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I would say almost every time that he took money from the
club I was present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And on any of these occasions other than the one you have
just described, do you recall his having a gun on his person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever see him take the money and actually put it in his
car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. On several occasions, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where would he put the money in his car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. In the trunk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you in a position where you could observe him put the
money into the trunk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you observe him take anything out of the trunk on those
occasions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you in a position so you could have seen him if he took a
gun out of the trunk and carried it with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I was usually right beside him placing something in the
car, myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you then on these occasions accompany Jack any place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Once or twice, but usually just put stuff in the car for him and
went back upstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And when you would leave Jack on any of these occasions,
did he have other people with him, who drove off with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. One or two times; yes. A couple of times he had Mr. Ralph
Paul with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how many occasions would you say you went down with
him to the car when he carried money down, put the money in the trunk, and
Jack drove off then alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I would say most of the time when I went down with him he
drove off alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you give us what your best estimate is of the number of
times this would have been when he drove off alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I would say about eight or nine times that I am definite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many times a day did you have occasion to go into the
trunk of Jack’s automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Maybe it would be 2 or 3 days I wouldn’t go near his automobile,
and there might be a day when I would go get something out of the trunk of
his car two or three different times during the day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On occasions when you went down to the trunk of his car was
Jack carrying money around in the trunk of his car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. He most always had money in the trunk of his car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you know this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He had told me so on several occasions, and on several occasions
I was with him when he placed money in his car when I went upstairs and then
he would send me down after something out of the trunk of his car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you able to tell whether, after Jack would carry the daily
receipts down to the car if he would continue to carry money in his car, in the
trunk of his car, or whether he would take the money out so that the next day
when he would come back and pick up the next day’s receipts the trunk was
empty so far as money was concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He carried the money for the receipts for a week at a time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On these occasions when he carried the money for a week at
a time, do you ever recall him going into the trunk and putting the gun in his
pocket as he was driving off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. Only one time that I can recall a gun being in the car,
I was in the car with Jack, I believe it was the second night I was at the Vegas
Club, he brought the money sack in and the money sack that the gun was in,
was in the main money sack, and we put it in the front seat of the car between
us, right by my side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it Jack’s practice to keep a key to the trunk of the car any
place in the automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Other than on his key ring, I wouldn’t know of any keys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many occasions did you have to go down to Jack’s automobile
by yourself and open the trunk of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Oh, I would say between 15 or 20 or 25 times while I was with
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And on each of these occasions did you have to get a key to
open the trunk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Jack would give me the key, he would give me his key ring
with the key on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there ever any occasions when Jack left the trunk unlocked
that you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. The trunk on his car was the type that you have got to
unlock it to open it, and when you close it it automatically locks, and you
remove the key and it automatically locks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack have a regular parking space for his car near the
Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; in the parking garage right downstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you seen where he parked his car at his home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I saw the parking lot. I don’t know whether he used the same
space all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it an open parking lot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know if Jack had any sort of a safe in this apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is, you don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Hubert, do you have any questions you want to ask along
this line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were talking about the trunk and the money and all that.
Did you get into the record about where the gun was?</p>

Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I believe we did, but why don’t you ask the questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It wasn’t clear to me, perhaps I didn’t catch it, as to whether
or not Jack kept the gun in the trunk of the car or on his person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. In the trunk of the car, he kept it in a money sack in the trunk
of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I believe your testimony was that, so that Mr. Hubert can be
brought up to date, that you only ever saw him carry the gun on his person on
two occasions, one of those occasions being when you brought the gun up to
him at the club in connection with some sort of an argument that he had, and
the other one was when he brought it in a money bag on one occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that your testimony a few moments ago concerning the money
and how you saw him put money in there, sometimes you carried it down,
or at least saw it there, is that when there was money there there was a gun
with the money, usually in a sack with the money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The money was usually in a different, separate sack from the
gun, but at times he would take the sacks, on these two occasions that I know
of, he took the sack the money was in, the sack the gun was in and put them
all in a larger sack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know him to own a holster?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To hold a gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On the two occasions that he did have the gun on his person,
how did he have it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was inside of a money sack, and he carried it in his hands,
the money sack wrapped around the gun and laying in his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the two occasions that you say he had it on his person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never saw him put it in his pocket or his waistbelt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you ever heard from Jack or Andy Armstrong or anybody
else that Jack had ever been robbed or burglarized?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Continuing on with your copy of the FBI interview report, are
there any other corrections or additions or changes that you would make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. One addition I would like to make to my testimony of the fact
that when Ruby first came to the club on the day that President Kennedy was
killed, and before he left he called the paper and placed an ad to the effect that
we would be closed, from the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are reading this out of what is page 150?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Of your interview report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You have had a chance to read this interview report, and does
this refresh your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. After reading it yesterday evening, and thinking about
the whole thing yesterday, last night at the hotel, I have refreshed my memory
to some extent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After having refreshed your recollection with this report, are
you able to state how soon after Ruby came into the club he told Andy Armstrong
to notify the personnel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It wasn’t more than about a half hour or 45 minutes after
he came into the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But he didn’t do it right away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You people sat around for awhile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you discuss as you were sitting there the question of closing
the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe we did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember how Jack came to give these instructions to
Andy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How soon after Andy began to call the personnel do you remember
Jack calling the newspapers and changing the ad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was just shortly after Andy started calling personnel
and Jack went in and used the pay phone and said something about calling the
paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You recall if up to that time Jack had received a telephone call
from any newspaper person asking him if his clubs were going to be open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are there any other additions or changes or corrections that you
would make in this interview report in your testimony as a result of having
read the interview report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe yesterday I was talking about the financial setup of
the club. I believe I said it was fairly good. I would say that this portion of
my statement here referring to the financial setup was gained from the fact that
Jack was always complaining about going broke, and a portion in my testimony
the other day about the financial position of the club was my own opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you are referring to page 150 of the interview report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And as I understand what you are saying in here was that when
you told the FBI that the club couldn’t financially stand to be closed, you were
making that statement on the basis of what Jack had said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But your own personal opinion was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That the club was making enough money to hold its own, even
on a closure of 2 or 3 or maybe 4 days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you want to make a change on page 150 so that—well,
maybe we shouldn’t make this change. There is no question in your mind but
that the FBI interview states, is an accurate reporting of what you said at
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; there is no question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, passing on to page 151, is there anything there that you
would change?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The fact here that Ruby said he was going to his sister at that
time. I don’t believe he at that time mentioned where he was going. When
he returned later in the evening he mentioned where he was going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are referring to the language at the top of page 151 which
says, “Ruby said that he was going to his sister’s home and asked Crafard if
he desired to accompany him, which offer was refused”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I believe there was a time element setup there where they
haven’t included in this testimony here of the fact that the early portion of this
was about the financial setup, about calling the paper was at one time, and when
he said something about going to his sister was later in the afternoon.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Continuing on page 151, are there any other additions or corrections
or changes you would make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The second paragraph on page 151, the second complete paragraph
where it starts, “Ruby then came back to the club or called Crafard about
7:30 p.m., that evening.” I would like to strike out or called about 7:30 p.m.,
in the evening. The fact he had come back to the club is something I have
established yesterday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. But you did at that time you talked to the FBI, you
weren’t sure whether he came back or called?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how about the time—7:30 p.m., as you think back about
that now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. At the <span class="locked">time——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that an accurate time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe so. I believe it was a supposed time, approximate
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But is that your best recollection of the time, or would you now
alter your estimate of what time it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that I said yesterday it was about 6 or 6:30 when
he came back to the club, I am not sure. I would say between 6:30 and 7:30
would be about the best estimate I might give on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What makes you make that estimate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. If I remember right, 8 o’clock I was sitting in the drugstore
eating lunch, approximately 8 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How do you recall being at the drugstore at 8 o’clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The one girl that works over there goes off at 8 o’clock and she
left while I was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So, actually, you got to the drugstore some time before 8 o’clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And by that time Jack Ruby had already returned to the club and
asked you to accompany him to Eva Grant’s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack mention to you at that time anything about going
to the synagogue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; not that I can remember. On the third paragraph on page
151, I believe yesterday I gave an earlier time for this same event of Jack calling
me at the club on the morning of November 23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, the language you are referring to is on Saturday morning,
November 23, at about 5:30 a.m., Ruby called him and told him to meet him
downstairs with the Polaroid camera and some film.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I believe yesterday that the time I gave was about 2
hours earlier than this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is your best recollection now as to the time? Was your
memory more accurate at the time you told the FBI about this episode or is
it more accurate now after having spent 2 days discussing the matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe in the trial in Texas it came out pretty well to where
it just about had to be between 4:30 and 5 when he called.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you arrive at that conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. At the trial, there was quite a bit of questioning on this effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. And I believe the different times that some of the previous
witnesses had given the lawyer, and I come to the agreement it must have been
about between 4:30 and 5 o’clock that he called me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your best recollection now? That is what we want to get.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let’s disregard what other people have told you to suggest what
the time is, and try to think about your own activities. As I recall, you testified
that you talked for 2 or 3 hours with a girl on the telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then you read for a while, and then you apparently started
to doze off, to go to sleep.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe the other time, the time element I used yesterday would
be more of a correct time than this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us just your recollection right now today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I would say between about 3:30 and 4:30.</p>

<p>In the same paragraph further down, closer towards the bottom. “When he
got to the car, George, Ruby’s roommate, was also there and they drove out
on the Stemmons Freeway.” I believe in this testimony here the Stemmons
Freeway was more of a suggested name to me than anything else. I would like
to clearly state I am definitely not positive of that sign.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I believe you testified also yesterday that it was the Central
Expressway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. I believe it was on the Central Expressway.</p>

<p>Referring to page 152 of this testimony, and back to previous testimony, I
have made here concerning the mention of the name of Lee Harvey Oswald,
I believe that this would be about the first time that we used the name of Oswald,
was used very much among us. Previous to this, I don’t believe there was any
reference made to this person by name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Starting on page 151?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. With the sentence, “He also recalled that while being at the
waffle shop on Commerce Street, Ruby was reading about Lee Harvey Oswald in
a newspaper.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long a time would you say you spent at the waffle shop?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Twenty or twenty-five minutes, maybe a half hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what time it was when you were at the waffle shop?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Right around six in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you spend at the Earl Warren sign photographing
that sign?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not more than 20 minutes at the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You think it might have been as long as 20 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It might have been; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you spend some time in the car talking about the sign
before you got out to photograph it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No. I believe we got out of the car immediately when we
pulled over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did it take you 15 or 20 minutes to photograph the sign?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why did it take so long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Trying to get the right angle on the sign where I could get the
clearest picture of the words of the sign.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have to walk across the street to photograph the sign?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack Ruby get out of the car with you at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; all three of us, Ruby, Senator and myself got out of the
car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Going over onto page 152, are there any additions or corrections
which you would make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; that is about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to ask you some specific questions about that. I have
made some notes myself.</p>

<p>On the bottom of page 148 of the FBI interview, which is Exhibit 5226,
the FBI reports this language, “However, Andy Armstrong or Alexander, the
assistant manager and bartender would handle the money until midnight.”</p>

<p>Did you ever know Andy Armstrong by the name of Alexander?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I couldn’t recall exactly what his last name was. At that
time I believe my recollection was that it was either Armstrong or Alexander but
I wasn’t positive just exactly what his last name was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In this interview as reported on page 147 of Exhibit 5226, you
state that “After completing this job Ruby asked him to stay at the club and
work for room and board.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He had the room in front of Ruby’s office? This would be
approximately November 1, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I believe you have testified previously here that you thought
you worked for Ruby for 6 weeks to 2 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But, of course, if you went to work for him on November 1
you would have only worked for him about 3 weeks. Now, which is the more
accurate recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. My dates are mixed up on that. I am not positive of the date of the
Dallas, Texas State Fair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you work at the State Fair until the State Fair closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I thought I understood your testimony on Wednesday to be
that the second show that you worked for there, the one with the <span class="locked">band——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Closed a few days before the State Fair actually closed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It closed the day before the State Fair actually closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you continue to work at the State Fair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I stayed at the State Fair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So that the way to accurately date when you began to work
for Ruby would be in terms of when the State Fair closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It would be starting the day after the Dallas, Tex., State Fair
closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did the State Fair last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Two weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So that the show, How Hollywood Makes Movies lasted about
1 week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Right at that; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And the band show lasted about another week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On page 149, the FBI reports you as indicating, and I am quoting,
“He said that one night approximately November 14 or 15, 1963, Ruby
was having trouble with an MC Earl Norman at the Carousel and about 1:30
a.m., he, Ruby, sent Crafard out to the car to get the gun.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe in testimony yesterday I stated that I couldn’t remember
exactly who he had the trouble with, and I am right now not clear
after thinking all night, I am not clear in my mind as to the fact that it was
Earl Norman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was your memory accurate at the time you talked with the
FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not positive of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you sure, though, that the reason Ruby went to get the
gun was because he was having trouble with the M.C.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; that is what I say. I am not positive of the fact who it
was he was having trouble with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you sure that Ruby went to get the gun because he was
having trouble with somebody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; he had had some trouble with somebody and he had sent
me to get the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You stated that the gun was believed to be the property of
Howard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The Negro employee, and I am reading that from page 149.
Is it still your understanding that that gun was Howard’s gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Shortly after I went to work for Jack he told me or Howard told me that
when he first went to work for Jack he had three or four different guns and
he had permits for his pistols, and on a couple of occasions the law forces confiscated
his pistols and later returned them, and he was afraid this might happen
again and he wouldn’t get this particular pistol back so Jack asked him
if he could borrow the gun and he told Jack yes; he could use the gun as long
as he wanted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack ever say anything to you which indicated that the gun
was not Jack Ruby’s gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk to Howard about the gun that Jack Ruby had at
any time after you went down to the car on the 14th or 15th of November to
bring the gun up to Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever talk specifically with Howard about the gun that
Jack was carrying around in the trunk of his car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; this was the gun our conversation was about. He said
that gun had belonged, it was his gun, that he had loaned it to Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember what kind of a .38 caliber revolver this was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe it was a Colt. Other than that I couldn’t say. It
was a snubnosed revolver, Colt snubnosed is all I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there anything distinguishing about the handle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I couldn’t describe anything distinguishable about the handle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
but I believe I could recognize the revolver if I was to see it. Excuse me,
that handle was an, I believe an imitation bone handle on that pistol. I believe
it was kind of a grayish-white imitation bone handle with dark brown
spots on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You testified that you believe Little Lynn called sometime on
Friday evening, November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time would be your recollection that telephone call was
received, was it before or after you had dinner at 8 o’clock over at the
drug store?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that was before I had dinner. I believe I said something
to Jack about it when he came back and he said if she called again to
give, tell her to call Miss Grant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did she call back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so. And I told her to call Miss Grant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On page 151 of Exhibit 5226 you are reported as saying in connection
with the photograph of the Earl Warren sign and the post office box
and I am quoting from the FBI report, “Crafard said he was completely puzzled
as Earl Warren was unknown to him.”</p>

<p>I believe you testified earlier here in Washington that you recall Ruby making
some connection between an advertisement that he had seen in the newspaper
and the Earl Warren sign.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you remember that connection at the time you talked with
the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe I said something to them about the numbers on the
address having something to do with something else that Ruby had talked
about. I don’t believe I would have anything to do with this advertisement.
I don’t believe anything on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it possible that—are you clear that Ruby, now, that Ruby did
make some connection between the advertisement and the sign?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; very clear. It was in connection with the addresses on
the sign and this post office box number on this ad that he had saw in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you making this statement as a result of something that
you personally recall or is this something that is now in your mind because of
conversations you may have had with other people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. This is something that I personally, clearly recall him making
the statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it—Mr. Hubert, do you have any questions you want to ask
along that line?</p>

<p>On page 153 of Exhibit 5226 the FBI reports and I quote, “He knows of no
police contacts on Ruby’s behalf but said Ruby did keep a police card in the
cash register at the Carousel with a name unknown to him on it.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you describe this police card?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It was a white card with the emblem of a badge on it with
some numbers on top of it, numbers on the badge. I can’t recall what they
were, if they were even clear. I believe it to have been in connection with
some sort of a police club or something of that sort, either that or it was a
detective’s card that he might have one of the business cards, something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It was a card about the size of a business card?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And could you tell what police department this person was
from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Dallas, Tex., Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could it have been the Dallas County Sheriff’s office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It could have been; yes, sir. It was from the Dallas, one of the
Dallas police departments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, did it have the name that was written on this card or
printed on the card, did it have a rank in connection with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could it have been a card from a justice of the peace?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, I don’t believe so. I never saw a justice of a peace card
with an emblem of a shield on it. They usually have the emblem of the Justice
Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You mentioned Bill Willis as being a close friend of Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Bill Willis the leader of the band that played at the
Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you sure of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not positive but I believe he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Bill Willis, Ruby’s closest friend, in the band?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What led you to that conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Well, the fact that they would talk together quite often, if
something come up in connection with the band it was always Bill he talked to.
Bill seemed to talk to Ruby more than any of the other member of the band,
and Ruby when he talked to anybody in the band it would be to Bill Willis
more than anyone else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to depart from this exhibit for a bit. You worked
for the Tear Plating Company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am not clear whether that was in Texas or Oregon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. In Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the Ablon Poultry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know a detective by the name of Joe Cody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe that Jack had me call him on one occasion where he
wanted to talk to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You mentioned that you worked at the Dallas State Fair for
Bob Craven and Deke Miles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there anything about those men that would have led you
to believe that they were homosexuals?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. While you were working for Jack did you know that he was
getting any skin or scalp treatments of any sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know anything about any trichology treatments he was
getting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack express, ever express any concern about his baldness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This wasn’t a subject that he joked about or that other people
kidded him about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I remember; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall while you were working for Jack, Jack’s making
any inquiry concerning a business partner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes. He was trying to get somebody to go in with him to open
another club in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you hear him say about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. He called two or three different people and talked to them trying
to get them to go in with him on this club. He made something, a statement
to the effect that he had a building already, that it wouldn’t take much
to get it into shape, something about they could make the best club in Dallas,
make it into the best club in Dallas, I believe specialized clientele, you might
say a closed club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this going to be a striptease club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall any of the people that Jack talked with about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, sir; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was Jack trying to interest these people in doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Backing him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He was looking for money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know anything about any friends that Jack had at a
bar called Ed’s Bar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you familiar with Ed’s Bar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the Dallas Cabana, do you know anything about any
friends or acquaintances down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he knew the gentleman who runs the Cabana Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that man ever at the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I am not positive. He may have been but I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any idea how often Jack visited the Cabana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any idea how often he visited the Baker Hotel or
the Adolphus Hotel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever meet or hear Jack talk about or hear anybody else
talk about a girl named Connie Tramel or Trammell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I believe you testified before that you don’t recall Jack saying
anything about, saying anything after the President was killed about the dogs
he was going to send to California?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know whether Jack visited the Ritz Delicatessen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. The what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear of the Ritz, R-i-t-z, Delicatessen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe he ate meals there occasionally, although I am not
positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear Jack discuss any travels he had taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear him discuss having been to Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear him discuss anything about taking a Caribbean
cruise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Plans for taking a Caribbean cruise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear him discuss Barney Ross?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Barney Ross’ name familiar to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to hand you what I have marked as “Exhibit 5227” and
I would like you to look at that and tell me if you recognize that.</p>

<p>(Letter marked Crafard Exhibit No. 5227 for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; it is a letter I wrote.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you able to tell without having read that letter when it
was you wrote it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Not the exact date. It was while I was working for Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you recall how long it was before you left Dallas before
you wrote that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe about a week before I left Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall why you didn’t mail that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No, I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you read that letter through and tell us if that is the
actual letter that you wrote?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; this is the letter I wrote.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you like that letter back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Would you mind if we made a photocopy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I wouldn’t mind it if you want it but that—but just give me
a moment. I believe the reason I didn’t mail this letter because I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
remembered—because I had rewrote the letter just about exactly as it is here,
but in a neater hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you actually did mail that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long before you left Dallas did you mail that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It would have been about a week. About the same time I wrote
it. I am not sure of it, I am not definite of that. But I believe that is the
reason, I have done so on several occasions, wrote a letter and then rewrote
it so it would be neater.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I realize the letter is a personal letter. However, I think it
reflects some things about your state of mind while you were in Dallas and
your relationship to Jack Ruby that we would like to have for the record and
maybe we can handle this by my giving you a copy of that letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Have you got a copy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don’t have a photocopy of it but I have—it has been written
up in an FBI report and simply ask you if that is an accurate—the FBI report
is an accurate rendition of the letter and then we can refer to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Crafard, I understand you have asked us to return to you
the original of the letter written by you to “Dear Gale” covering the front
and back of a page, which has a letterhead on it “Jack Ruby Associates, Dallas,
Texas” and which has been identified in this deposition as Exhibit 5227.
Normally when a witness produces a document before the Commission we make
a photostatic copy, keep the copy and then give the witness his document back.
However, this document did not come into our possession in that way, you
see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We got this document from the FBI. Therefore, we do not
have authority to give it back to you. I will be glad to have a copy made for
you if you would like to do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. That is all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you like a copy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; there is no need to go to that trouble. It is just I had
no idea I had left that particular letter. I know I didn’t do it on purpose. It
was accidental, but I left it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Larry, I want to hand you what has been marked for identification
as “Exhibits 5228-A” and “5228-B”. Now, do you recognize those as photographs
of anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; these are photographs of my DD-214, my Army discharge,
the front and back sides.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are those, that DD-214, is the paper that you turned over to us
on Wednesday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are those true and accurate copies of the DD-214 that you gave
to us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. I am going to return to you your copy of the DD-214,
and thank you for producing that. I am also going to hand you two photographs
which I will mark in the following manner—hand you one photograph—I am
going to hand you two photographs which I may have marked “Washington
D.C., April 10, 1964, C. L. Crafard, Exhibits 5229-A and B,” and I will ask
you to look at those and tell us if you recognize those as photographs of anything
which you have seen before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; they are exhibits of the front side and reverse side of
the subpena that I was handed for the Jack Ruby murder trial in Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. You brought this subpena to us and turned it over
to us on Wednesday, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to return you, then, the subpena which you gave
us on Wednesday, and thank you for bringing that in. Did you also produce
on Wednesday a diary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to hand you a series of 10 photographs which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
marked, “Washington, D.C., April 10, 1964, C. L. Crafard, Exhibits 5230,”
and they are numbered on the face of the photograph in a sequence starting
with “A” which contains a picture of the front cover of a notebook which
says, “USS” with a circle around the USS, and then in quotation marks “oil
well” and then down on the bottom right-hand corner of this front cover which
is photographed the number 1964. That photograph has the letter “A” on the
front of it. After that, there are a series of photographs numbered in sequence
1 through 10 making a total of 11 photographs altogether. Now, I would
like you to look at these photographs and tell us if that is a, if those photographs
are photographs of anything that you have ever seen before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; these are photographs of a pocket diary that is put out
by United States Steel for the oil well corporation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who maintained that diary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that, are those photographs of the diary which you turned
over to us on Wednesday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you go through those photographs and tell us if everything
that you have written in that diary up to date has been photographed
in those pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; everything I have wrote in that book is here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do the Nos. 1 through 10 follow in sequence with the pages,
the sequence of the pages that contain writing in your notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to direct your attention to photograph No. 1. There
is a notation at the top of that photograph. Would you read that notation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. “No. 844,” the letters HEB 12, 13 and underneath, 844 is the
Nos. 12 with a dash 23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you put that notation in the notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you put that on there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Just shortly after I got the notebook in Michigan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is that notation, what does that refer to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. It refers to the Bible. It is referring to the Book of Hebrews,
page 844 the 12th Chapter, and 23d verse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why did you write that in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. There is something in the Bible that refers to the church to
which I belong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What church is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. General Assembly Church of the First Born. That is the only
place in the Bible where the name can be found.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Hubert, do you have any questions that you want to ask
about the notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to return the notebook to you at this time, and I
want to thank you for bringing those documents to us. I want to ask you
one final question. Is there anything which has come to your attention in
connection with the murder of Lee Oswald or the assassination of President
Kennedy that you haven’t told us about that you think would be of value to
the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I can’t think of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I will ask you after we conclude this deposition if anything
does come to your attention which might be of value to the Commission if
you would contact us and bring it to our attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes; I will do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Hubert, do you have any questions that you want to ask?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes. There have been several conversations between us which
might be called interviews in the sense we were talking about the matter at
hand during lunch and so forth, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember that anything we conversed about at lunch
or any interviews, has not been subsequently made a part of this deposition?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever talked to any other member of the Commission
staff than Mr. Griffin and myself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you feel that considering your testimony and various exhibits
that you have identified that we have all you know about the matter that
the Commission is investigating?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that is, the death of President Kennedy, and the subsequent
violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald, and Ruby’s connection therewith.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crafard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to thank you for coming here and spending these 3
days with us, and I believe that concludes the deposition.</p>

<h2 id="LITCHFIELD">TESTIMONY OF WILBYRN WALDON (ROBERT) LITCHFIELD II</h2>
</div>

<p>The testimony of Wilbyrn Waldon (Robert) Litchfield II was taken at 1:35
p.m., on April 16, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building,
Bryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant
counsel of the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This will be the deposition of Mr. Wilbyrn Litchfield, <span class="locked">II——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. When I sign, I sign “W. W. (Bob) II”,—does that need to
be in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You can bring that out later when I ask you more about your
name.</p>

<p>Mr. Litchfield, my name is Leon Hubert. I am a member of the advisory
staff of the General Counsel of the President’s Commission on the Assassination
of President Kennedy, under the provisions of Executive Order 11130,
dated November 29, 1963, and Joint Resolution of Congress No. 137, and the
rules of procedure adopted by the Commission in conformance with the Executive
order and the joint resolution, and I have been authorized to take a sworn
deposition of you.</p>

<p>I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is to
ascertain, evaluate, and report on the facts relating to the assassination of
President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>In particular as to you, Mr. Litchfield, the nature of the inquiry today is to
determine what facts you know or may know about the death of Oswald, or any
other facts you may know about the general inquiry, or, about the possible connection,
if any, of Jack Ruby with the death of Oswald or the death of President
Kennedy.</p>

<p>I think you have appeared here by virtue of a letter—written request made
to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t receive a letter to come?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Sorrels called me long distance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I must advise you then that under the rules established
by the Warren Commission, to govern the procedure of handling witnesses and
so forth, every witness is entitled to a 3-day written notice that we wish to
take his deposition, but those rules also provide that if a witness wishes to,
he may waive that 3-day notice and just go ahead and testify now. So, I ask
you now whether you are willing to waive the 3-day notice and proceed to
testify now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you stand and I will administer the oath.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give will be the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are commonly known among your friends as Bobby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Bob.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do I understand also that there are some of your legal documents
that you always sign that way too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I sign it “W. W. (Robert) Litchfield, II.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old are you, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Thirty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now where do you reside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. 654 West Cross Timbers, Houston, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Professional bowler and bowling instructor and I sell trophies
for a bowling supply and bowling equipment office—balls, bags, shoes—etc.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you been so occupied?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Since January of this year—approximately the middle of
January.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your occupation prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. From July 1963, until January of 1964, I did not work.
In July 1963, from March 1, 1962, until July 1963, I sold books and worked myself
up to a regional manager’s position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of what company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I was with the Spencer International Press from March of
1962 until May of 1963 working in Dallas-Fort Worth—made district manager
in San Jose, Calif., made regional manager February 1963, in Atlanta, Ga., and
stayed until May of 1963, and my father’s death brought me back to Dallas.
I left Spencer and went to work for Great Books of the Western World in
June, made district manager in 2 weeks, and was terminated in July due to my
past record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you mean by “past record”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I have a criminal record when I was 19 years old, that’s
11 years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the nature of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I forged some hot checks and paid them off, but because I
still had a bunch of them out—I had three charges in Fort Worth, eight in Dallas,
the sum total was roughly $3,000. Restitution was made prior to the time I
went to court. I went to court and received 3 years concurrently on each charge,
3 years on each charge in Fort Worth, 3 years on each charge in Dallas, and concurrently
backdated at Fort Worth to August of 1952.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that in the Federal Court?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No, sir; State and county. I was in prison from February—well,
I was arrested August 1952, pleaded guilty in Fort Worth in November
1952, pleaded guilty in Dallas in January 1953, went to Huntsville Prison in
February 1953, made conditional pardon in December 1953—do you want all this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; and you were released then, I take it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Right. Pardon was reversed because I was married and I
was voluntarily returned from Denver, Colo.; I just came back myself and
turned myself in at Huntsville and I was released in April of 1956.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were actually released from Huntsville in December 1953,
under a conditional pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes, sir; to Denver, Colo.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, that it was with the permission of the State of
Texas—Texas authorities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you on any terms of good conduct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I had to report each month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In Denver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Right, and obtain a job, and I obtained one and my parole
officer—I asked him should I tell them I’m on parole, and he said “No,” and
three places I worked after I was there he called and asked how I was doing
and identified himself, which caused my termination, and the last place I worked
was a laundry. I was driving a truck and the man told him—do you want the
words he used?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. “I don’t give a damn what he is doing, he is doing a good
job.” And I have a better recommendation from him that he sent me when I
came back to Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You said something about turning yourself in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes, sir; my parole was revoked in July 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the reason for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. The reason on my revokement is “unadjustment, unable to
adjust.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was done in Texas or Colorado?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. It was done in Colorado—in Denver, and in August 1955, I
left Denver, Colo., and drove home and said goodbye to Mother and Dad and
drove down to Huntsville—in fact, my Dad drove down to Huntsville with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, when you found out that the Colorado people
had in effect recommended the revocation or revoked your parole, you knew
that you would be eventually sought?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Or just sent back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you just bypassed that and drove yourself into Huntsville?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I went to Austin first to the parole board and they said, “We
have already reviewed your case and formulated an opinion. You are going
back.” And I said, “Well, I’m not going back today. I’ll go back tomorrow,” and
I went back the following day and turned myself in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you stay in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. From August 1955 until April 1956, and I was discharged in
April 1956.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you discharged completely?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Completely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or on conditions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Completely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Completely?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No conditions whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No conditions at all. Have you had any difficulty since then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Do you want the FBI fingerprint record for the time I have
been picked up? I have been picked up six or seven times for investigation.
I was picked up in Arizona for investigation, I was picked up in Florida for
investigation. I got low on money—I wrote some hot checks in 1957 in Arlington,
Va., and I paid them off and that was my latest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were not charged?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes: in Arlington, Va., in 1957, I got 6 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And did you serve any part of that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Five months—four months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then you were discharged from that without condition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes—without condition. That was in a county jail. I was
a trustee—I was head cook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, have you had any other convictions since then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Since then—no, sir; one felony and one misdemeanor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that’s the two you have already told us about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you were 19 and the other one in 1957?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I was charged—excuse me—I was picked up in January or
February 1958 and returned to Arlington, Va., and I was released at Arlington,
Va., in August 1958.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Since August 1958, you have had no trouble with the law?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Other than the fact that I—of being picked up for investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you had no convictions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you ever charged at all—formally, I mean, by actual indictment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No—no indictments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are not under any charge right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say you are married; when were you married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I got married in 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you support yourself between July 1963, and January
1964, when you were unemployed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. My wife was working—my wife was working and I lived
with her and my mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you attempt to get work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes—that’s one reason I left Dallas. The person who is division
manager of Great Books that terminated me, falsified—the reason I was
terminated, he accused me of something I did not do, and I couldn’t prove it.
It was my word against his. I couldn’t prove it, and in January I had a chance
to go to Houston to work for Great Books and I went there and I tried to use
the name of Robert Field—I had made man-of-the-month for the Great Books
organization of the whole United States, and my picture was in their magazine
called the Phenix. And the division manager in Houston recognized me and
checked it out and then 2 weeks later I had requested from this gentleman here
about three orders for me to be paid off. He had said they did not clear, that
there was no money involved and 3 weeks later through my bank here in Dallas,
Bank of Services and Trust, it just so happens that the man’s name is Charles
Counter. He has his personal account there also, and I’ve got him on two counts
of forgery right now. He took my paycheck, signed my name, and endorsed it
over to him. I have the photostats from the bank and the photostats of the
canceled checks that cleared the company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But in any case, the point I think you are making—that your opportunity
to get with Great Books of the Western World in Houston was frustrated
because of the fact that you had changed your name and they found out.
That is, changed your name to the extent of leaving off the first syllable of your
last name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes, and the division manager there even talked to the president
of the company and he said “No.” So, I went to work for this bowling
supply which is owned by F. M. Curtis and Mel Livingston and I told them my
past record, and Mr. Curtis is a highway patrolman, he has an interest in the
supply business and he said, “I’ll give you a break,” and I’ve been doing real
good since. He just gave me a break.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say you are a professional bowler?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you competed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes; in 1960 and 1961 I did, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Well, I bowled in the All-American here in Dallas, the PBA
tour in 1961, I bowled in the Santa Fe Open in 1961 and I bowled in the small—when
I say “small” I mean $3,000 to $5,000 total first place, singles and doubles
tournaments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever won any prizes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes, I have won prizes but I have never won the first place—no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the most that you have won?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. $750.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Ardmore, Okla.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Ardmore, Okla.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what part of the year—what tournament was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. It’s called the Ardmore Classic. I think they run it from
about May to about August. It’s 8 games across 16 lanes, handicapped from 2
to 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You won $750—which was not first place, but what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. About eighth place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you won it under your name W. W. Litchfield or Bob Litchfield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you were living in Dallas, I take it, in the last 6 months of
1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were you living then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. 302 West Clarendon. I also lived at the Drexel House
Apartments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where are they located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Oh, me, I have forgotten the address—Henderson and Knox.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who runs that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I’ve forgotten the lady’s name that runs that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Bertha Cheek.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No—she does not run it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Bertha Cheek?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what street she lives on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes; I do—Bertha Cheek lives on Swiss Avenue. She owns
an apartment house on Swiss, but the Drexel House is on—right off the corner
of Knox.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever live at Bertha Cheek’s boarding house or apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Never?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you get to know her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I met her through a fellow at the bowling alley—I don’t
remember his last name. He owns an electric company here in town, the one
that has the lighting for all the fairgrounds, Bob Sands Electric Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he operates the bowling alley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No, sir; he was a bowler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was a bowler himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever visit at her place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, her apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Oh, let’s see, spasmodically from September to October and
November of 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words you met <span class="locked">her——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. In September—I’m pretty sure it was, about the latter part
of August or the first of September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you met her by simply being introduced to her by Sands
at a bowling alley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No; he told me she had planned on putting in a lounge and
Bob had given her my phone number and she called me on the pretext that
I might build it and run it for her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you went to see her then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you went to her house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes; on Swiss.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had never seen her before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Never before that—she said she had seen me, but there was
no recollection or no introduction prior to that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, what happened to the negotiations that you engaged in
with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. It would be that I would have had to divorce my wife and
had to have married her for any other further business to have been transacted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If I’m not mistaken, isn’t she an older woman than you are
a man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I believe she is—she’s 30-something or 40-something.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you are saying to us that she made it a condition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. It wasn’t a verbal condition—it was a obvious condition.
It was a situation that was arising, let’s say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you perceived that you would have to marry her if this
thing was to go forward?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. That, or divorce my wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But she did not say so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You think she intimated it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Let’s say, from my past experience and knowledge of—worldly
knowledge—I would assume this, that’s being kind of tactful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I was wondering if you could point to any events, since you can’t
point to any words that gave you that impression?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Without being too personal or intimate on my own actions
or any actions other than hers, no; and I don’t care to be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Did you know Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes; I knew Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you meet him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Jack used to own the Vegas Club and I used to go there
quite a bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do—how long do you suppose it is that you have known
Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Oh, I would say from 1959—October, roughly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Continuously?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Well, I will go in and say “hello” to him, see him whenever
I would go in. It wasn’t a friendship relation that I would go out of my way
to call him or see him or that he would call me. He had no way of knowing
how to call me. He knew me when he saw me and said, “Hello, how are you?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the Carousel Club, did you visit it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I have been in that place twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us when that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. When I was associated with Bertha and she was thinking
of putting in a business, we looked at a whole bunch of clubs she thought were
for sale, and I knew the Vegas Club was not making any money and I would
have liked to have tried to buy it from Jack, so one night I went down to see
him—I had called and he said he would be there about 10:30 or 11 and he got
there about 11:15 or 11:30, something like that, and I discussed the purchase of
the Vegas Club and that’s when he told me it had, I think, $40,000 worth of
Federal liens or something against it which still had it, and he tried to sell me
the Carousel and I wouldn’t attempt to put in a private club in downtown Dallas;
I was thinking of making the Vegas a private club by remodeling it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But what you wanted to put in was a private club, not an open
or public club like the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. That’s right—a private club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was your opinion that the Carousel was not the proper
place for a private club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Right—any downtown location. You see, I cannot obtain an
open—let’s say a beer license because of my record with the city of Dallas, but I
can obtain a private club license from the State of Texas, even though I have a
record. I talked to Buddy Mills on the liquor board and he said, “If you
haven’t done anything in 3 to 5 years—no conviction or anything,” you can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was the first time you were in the Carousel and you were
there with Cheek?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No; I was not. I was alone. That was the second time I
had been in there. I had been in there one other time—I just went in to see what
it was—I didn’t speak to anybody at all that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you give us the date of the second time that you did speak
to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I think right around the middle of October—the second week
or the third week, somewhere along in there—the exact date—no; I cannot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you said that at the time—or you said once before in your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
statement—at the time you were there there were some people taking pictures
of the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. There were some fellows—you see, when I walked in Jack
wasn’t there and I told the doorman, whom I found out later was his roommate—I
don’t remember the man’s name, that I was to see Jack on business
and he said he wasn’t there, and so I sat down and had some coffee and watched
the bumps and what have you, and after Jack came in, then he had to see two
or three people before me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you happen to mention to the doorman or anybody else
around there that you were from California?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whom did you tell that to, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. The doorman and some other fellow that was sitting there.
He asked me where I was from and I said, “California and Phoenix”—is all I
said. I didn’t think it was any of his business who I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the name of the other man, other than the
doorman to whom you said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No—he was a little short fellow, I would say late forties or
maybe even middle fifties. If I remember right he had kind of a silver hairline—I
don’t remember—whether he was kind of bald in the center or not, I
know it was receding, and he had an appearance of being of Jewish descent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think you might recognize his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I doubt it, because when he was introduced to me I didn’t
pay that much attention to it—no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who introduced you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. The doorman. They were sitting there together drinking
a Seven-Up or a Sprite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, so, you just stayed and waited for Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you have to wait?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I think—30 or 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And Jack came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. The dog first, then him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, did he see you right away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No, he walked by me because I was sitting right by the door
and he turned and said something to the doorman first and then I think he went
on back and put his hat up and came back to the doorman, and that’s when the
doorman pointed me out—he walked over and said—just a moment—he had
two or three other fellows to see him—I was sitting by the door—have you ever
been in the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Well, I was sitting by the door like this, as you are walking
in you have to turn left. There is an aisle and there was a fellow sitting back
here by the pole with the light switches on it and there was a fellow sitting in
front of me, and then there was the photographer who was there. I didn’t meet
the photographer until after I had been introduced to Jack and Jack introduced
me to him—some magazine for strippers like Male or Stag type magazine and
he was taking pictures and he had to get releases from the strippers—some kind
of a release they would have to sign so that he could take their pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You saw him getting the releases from the people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Well, I saw how he came in and he had the releases in his
hand. He said he had to get all of the girls to sign them and he said all of them
would sign them except one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was when you were talking to Jack in his office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. In his office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The photographer came in and said that he had some papers
in his hand which you understood to be releases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No, he said he had the releases and had to go out and get
them signed, and then he came back again and said all except one was signed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was on that occasion that you talked to Jack
about buying the Vegas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he counteroffered by suggesting that you buy the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do I understand that that was the last time you saw Jack that
night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. It was until I saw him on television—I happened to be
playing poker then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you fix the time of that occasion with reference to particularly
the death of the President, about how long before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Well, like I said, it was probably the middle of October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think it was about a month and a little bit before the
death of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. He was killed the last half of November—maybe 5 weeks
or 6 weeks—it was about the middle of October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you have previously stated that you saw a man in there
on this occasion who you thought was Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I did—in fact, I made the statement, as I was saying a while
ago, when I was playing poker—a bunch of fellows from the bowling alley—we
usually play on Saturday night. We started about 9:30 and the game
continued all through the night—one of those $2 limit games and we were
still playing Sunday, and the fellow’s wife had carried the children to church
and come back and said something about Ruby had shot Oswald on television.
No, excuse me, “Had shot him.” She had heard it on the radio, and so we
turned on the television and they were rerunning all of this and a big hullabaloo
over it and that was the next time I saw Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And did you make any comment at that time that you had seen
Oswald in the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I had seen Oswald on television before. I said, “That guy
looks familiar,” and a few of the fellows were around, and I don’t remember
where I said it there at the poker game, but somebody said, “I think I’ve seen
that Oswald around somewhere,” and I made the statement, “Yes, I think
I have seen him too,” and that was the extent of it. Nothing more was said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that statement you made that you had seen Oswald around
somewhere, was it made before Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you repeat it thereafter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I did to a friend of mine who is on the vice squad here in
Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Donald Green.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you tell him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Well, it was the day preceding the day that I went down—I
think I went down on a Monday to the police station to talk to the FBI agents
and everybody, so I must have talked to Don on the Sunday night preceding
that or on Saturday. I called him on the phone and I told him, “I think I
have seen that man with Jack up at the Carousel.” I said, “I don’t know,
but I’m pretty darn sure I have.” And he made some calls and called me
back and said the police department right now wants to talk to me, and he
met me—I believe it was Monday, I’m pretty sure it was a Monday, he met
me Monday morning about 9:15 or 9:30 at the coffee shop of the Statler and we
walked on up to the police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you made a statement of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And subsequently that same day you made a statement to the
FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Two FBI agents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think they asked you to take a polygraph test too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. And the tests showed that I hadn’t seen him because when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
the man giving it asked me, “Have you definitely seen him,” and I said, “Yes,”
and it showed that I hadn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean he told you the results of the test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No, he didn’t tell me the results of the test, but Donald did—he
didn’t tell me—he didn’t come right out and say, “No,” but it was obvious.
They had me pick Oswald’s picture out of a bunch of police photographs, and
anybody on the street could pick that man’s picture out. That doesn’t mean
I have seen him—I told them that—I said, “Heck, anybody walking can pick
his picture out.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you had observed to someone prior to the shooting of
Oswald that you thought you had seen Oswald somewhere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who were the people that you were—that you observed that to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Let me understand your question—whom did I say this to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I mentioned it like I said, there at the poker game.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This was the same poker game that went on into Sunday the
24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Was that the day that Oswald was killed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes—that would be it. From Saturday the 23d to Sunday the
24th—I made it then, <span class="locked">and—</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you make it after Oswald was shot at that same poker game?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. That’s when I made it. We was watching it on television—the
rerun of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I had understood you to say that you had said you thought you
had seen Oswald somewhere, and that you made that statement prior to the
time that Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I made it once but like I said, I don’t remember who I made
it to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was not at the poker game?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No—the statement at the poker game—we were watching it
on television and it showed everything there and someone says, “I think I’ve
seen that fellow,” and I said, “Yes; I think I’ve seen him too.” That was the
second time I had said it—before when his picture came out and everything,
I said, “I think I have seen him,” but I don’t remember where I was when I
said it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did your poker game begin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Oh, Saturday night about 9 or 9:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And went on <span class="locked">until——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Into Sunday and until about 6:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In the afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that the first time you made the observation that you thought
you had seen Oswald somewhere must have been before the poker game began?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes—it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that would be before 9 o’clock on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes—it was. It was right after the assassination—they
were showing all the films and the capture of Oswald, etc., and when I was
watching television, I don’t remember where I was, I said, “I think I’ve seen
him.” And people sitting around me said, “He looks familiar,” and I made
the statement, “I think I have seen him.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when Oswald was shot and you made the statement again
that you had thought you had seen Oswald, did you say anything that would
indicate that you had seen him, Oswald, at Ruby’s place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No; I just said, “I think I’ve seen him too,” I forgot who
it was I said that to, but the guy said. “I think I have seen him or I think I
know that guy,” and I just said, “Yes; I think I have seen him, too.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did it occur to you that—then that it might have been that
you had seen him at Ruby’s place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I started trying to remember—everybody was sitting around
and saying, “Where have you seen him?” Trying to think, and I thought about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
it and I remembered seeing a man similar to him, very similar to him at the
Carousel that night I was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you say that to anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Just Don Green when I called him on the phone and then
when I went down to the police department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you say that to any of the people you were playing poker
with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you give us the names of the people you were playing
poker with, whose house was it at, first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. J. W. Grubbs [spelling] G-r-u-b-b-s.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where does he live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Boy, I can’t tell you that—I can tell you how to go there,
but I don’t remember what street it is. You go out Beckley past the A. Harris
shopping center—I don’t remember the name of the street, you turn left and
then you went down a couple of blocks and you turn left again—there were
three cars of us and I followed. I don’t remember the name of the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you tell us the names of some of the other people at the
poker game?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. J. W. Grubbs and there was Ernie Stoy [spelling] E-r-n-i-e
and S-t-o-y, and one fellow I just met, he just came in—I didn’t know, and
another fellow, gee, I sure wish I could remember his name. I know him
when I see him—they are always at the bowling alley, he usually bets on the
pot games, and he is a big heavy set black headed fellow and Max Lewis was
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. [Spelling.] L-e-w-i-s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes [spelling], L-e-w-i-s, and I think there was one more—I
don’t remember who that was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They were all there throughout the game—were they all there
throughout the game?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Max left Sunday morning and then returned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, at the time it became known that Ruby had shot Oswald, did
you observe to anyone that you knew Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I believe I did. I think everybody was saying whether they
knew him or not and I believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did anyone else there know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I think one or two others might have said that they knew him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whether Grubbs knew him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No, sir; I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who said they knew him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I could assume, but I don’t remember who said that they
knew him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, you did not at that time say that you thought you
had seen Oswald in the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No, sir; I just said that—you are getting mixed up. I said—when
it became obvious that Ruby had shot him, we were watching it on television,
and we were, you know, how you are talking, “I think I know him,” and
I said, “I’m pretty sure I know Jack Ruby,” and I said, “What is that idiot
doing now?” Or something like that, and I forgot that someone said, “That
Oswald, I think I’ve seen him somewhere before,” and that’s when I said it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You said the same thing, “I think I’ve seen him?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was it you began to associate Oswald as a man that you
had seen somewhere before—and as also the man you had seen in Jack Ruby’s
club the last time you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I believe it was that day—not that I was associating necessarily
it with Ruby—it was that everybody all of a sudden had seen him and
they were trying to think where they had seen him and I was trying to remember
where I had seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, my point is that you ultimately came to tell Jack <span class="locked">Green——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Don Green.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Don Green, that you thought you had seen him at the Carousel?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did that firm up in your mind, because from what I gather
it was not firmed in your mind where you had seen him, on the Sunday when
you were playing poker, isn’t that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Correct. I wasn’t positive then, no, where I had seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you become positive that you had seen him at the
Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Well, I was thinking about it during the week, on Thursday
or Friday, and it dawned on me that that looked like the fellow that I had seen
in the Carousel.</p>

<p>There was another fellow up there that I had never seen before and made a
heck of an impression on me—he was about twice my size, a real flashy dresser,
white on white shirt and his suit was a very flashy type, and he had just gotten
married, but he, himself, made a heck of an impression on me, the way he was
dressed and his size, and this fellow that I had seen in the Carousel made a
heck of an impression on me the way he was dressed—he was dressed sloppy—in
a sloppy shirt and kind of a gray khaki-type pants. I thought, “What is this
idiot doing up here?” You know, because it is known that the Carousel is a
clip joint and you’ve got to be an idiot to go in there in the first place, or a
tourist, one of the two, and I just ran—I guess you would just say that it
came into my mind that that looked like the fellow I had seen. I was associating
the sloppy dress with him because he was dressed sloppy on television and when
you see it repeatedly and repeatedly—you remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us how you think the man might have been Oswald that
you saw in the Carousel was dressed on the occasion you saw him, which was
the last time you saw Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. He had on a white sweater and kind of a T-shirt-type
sweater, and a pair of, I guess they were gray khakis or they might have been
gabardine, there was no crease in them and they were real sloppy and his hair
wasn’t combed, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t talk to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No, I didn’t talk to anybody while I was there other than
Jack and I did meet that photographer—I don’t remember his name. Jack
introduced me, and I did meet that great big guy. He came back into the
office—he did once while I was in there with Jack and he had just gotten married
to some girl from Galveston and they were celebrating their honeymoon and I
was thinking, “You’ve got to be a nut to come to a place like this to celebrate
a honeymoon.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you came out of Jack’s office, did you see this man that
you think might be Oswald in there still?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. When you come out of his office, you can’t see nothing—you
walk down the hall and turn left and then you are back in the club part of it—the
Carousel.</p>

<p>Now, when I came back in the club part, the man that I thought was Oswald
had already seen Jack—I was the last one to see him—I don’t think there were
more than two or three people left in the club—this big heavy-set fellow and
his wife were still there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, this man you thought was Oswald was waiting
to see Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he was ahead of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you had an opportunity to observe him then as the man
who got to see Jack before you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he there before you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And was sitting down at the table?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he drinking something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I don’t remember if he had something or not. He was in
front of me and all I could see was his back at that time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever get a look at his face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. When he left he had to walk right by me. The door is not
more than—it’s one of these partition-type doors and it is not more than 5 feet
or 4 feet wide, and the table I was sitting at—I was sitting at the edge of the
door. I couldn’t help but see him when he walked along there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long was he in with Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No more than 10 or 15 or 20 minutes, maybe, at the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And when he came out you went in Jack’s office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No; you see, Jack’s office is back, in the back and you got to
walk down two halls and Jack came out and got me. This fellow came out and
then Jack came out and got me and I went back there with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you observe what this fellow you thought might be Oswald
did at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. He went on out the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see him again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No; not until I saw him on television—and I thought it was
the same one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, that impression got firmer and firmer in your mind, as I
gather it, as the week went on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. After that Sunday television seeing Jack shoot him there;
yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But when you told Don Green your impression, it was not the
same day, was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No, sir; it was a week later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was actually the Sunday later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I believe it was Saturday or Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the impression began to grow on you more and more that it
might well be the same man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And as a matter of fact, as I understand you, it grew so much
that you thought you should tell someone about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I called Don and asked him what he thought I should do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he suggested coming to the office and I think you have told
us about that.</p>

<p>Was there another man around there you heard had come from California?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. There was somebody waiting to see Jack, like I said, that was
sitting—there was a aisle going straight and you got to turn left—back by the
pole where the light switches are, and he was waiting to see him and I believe
he said he was from California and he was in his middle thirties, a black-headed
fellow. I never met the man and he saw Jack and he was still there when I
left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. This fellow we are speaking of now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From California, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I think he said he was from California. I think when I came
in the doorman said, “Well, there are two other people here and the photographer
to see him ahead of you,” when I first came in, and he said, “He’s late now, but
you can have a seat and wait if you want to.” And the two other people were
the fellow whom I assumed that looked like this Oswald, and this fellow, I believe
that said he was from California and the photographer—were the three
people in front of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see the man who said he was from California talk to the
man you think was Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had never seen Oswald before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No; never had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were shown pictures of Oswald, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I was shown a police photograph of him, front and side view,
with three others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your impression at that time as to whether Oswald
was the man you had seen in the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I wasn’t asked my impression at that time—all I was asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
is, “Pick out Oswald,” and I said, “There he is, anybody walking in Dallas could
do it.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the purpose in having you pick out Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I would imagine the police department wanted to know if I
really knew him or really had seen someone like him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, when you picked out Oswald, were you simply picking out
Oswald because you had seen his picture on television, or were you picking him
out because he was the man you thought you had seen in the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. When I picked out his picture, I was picking it out because I
had seen it on television so many times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, the police wouldn’t ask you to pick out Oswald’s picture
unless there was some reason for your specific identification of Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. <span class="locked">Well——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had called Green, from what you tell me, to tell him that
you thought that you had seen a man who looked like Oswald at the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Wasn’t that the reason why they were asking you to pick out
the man that you had seen at the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I would assume—I don’t know. I wouldn’t know their
reasoning behind it. I would assume this would be it, but when I picked him
out, I told them at the time, I made the statement, “Anybody in Dallas could
pick him out—he was on the TV so much.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever tell them that the man I now know is Oswald from
the films and that I am now picking him out is also the man that I saw at the
Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You told them that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you believe that to be true?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I thought it was until they convinced me I was wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you think about it now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I said, “It sure as heck looked like him,” that’s all I can
say now. Of course, I don’t want to say I’m definitely positive it is—I
said, “It’s a heck of a close resemblance.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s your testimony right now, that as far as the man you
saw and have described—sloppy clothes, white jacket—T-shirt type—go in and
see Ruby before you on an occasion approximately 5 weeks before the assassination
of the President, that that man and the Oswald photographs later shown
you, you think that they bore a close resemblance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes; they do—they bear a resemblance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I gather that you were more positive of the identity of Oswald
as being the man in the Carousel on the occasion we have been speaking about
at one time than you are now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I was; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What has caused your opinion in the matter to weaken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. The fact that they gave me the polygraphic test, that showed
when they asked me—was it definitely him, it didn’t show up right, and the fact
that I had told Don when I called him, I said, “It sure as heck looks like him,”
and when the police were questioning me, they said, “Are you positive, are
you positive, are you positive?”</p>

<p>I said, “It looks like him, it looks like him, it looks like him.” And they
come back, “Are you positive, are you positive?” And then the fact that when
the Federal agents talked to me, they said, “You know, if you say you are
positive and it wasn’t him,” it’s a Federal charge, and I said, “Well, I’m not
that positive.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The Federal agent told you if you gave an <span class="locked">opinion——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No; they said, “If you give false information as to an exact
statement—” not an opinion, but if I say I’m positive, that’s a statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, are you conveying to me that you really were positive,
but <span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. In my mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were scared off of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No, sir; no, sir. I said in my mind I was positive that it
looked like him, but I’m just as fallible as anybody else. I could be 100 percent
wrong. I said, “In my mind, the man that I saw looked just like him,” but
then again, I can’t say 100 percent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that is still your opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I said it bears a close resemblance, but not having come in
contact with Oswald at all or having never met him or anything, and just seeing
him for a fleeting glance, the back of his head and when he walked by me; no,
I can’t be 100 percent pure positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you knew all of that the first time you told it to Green?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Well, like I said, “It sure does look like him—the man I
saw there sure does look like Oswald,” those are my words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, what has caused you to weaken in your opinion it was
Oswald, as you tell it to me, is the fact that you got the impression that if
you gave a positive identification and it proved to be false, that it would be
a Federal offense, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes; they said, giving false information to the FBI, and I’m
not 100 percent pure positive. I say, “It bears a close resemblance,” and this
is all I can say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that’s all you did tell them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes, sir; that’s the statement I signed.</p>

<p>Now, the big heavy-set fellow that I met, I shook hands with, made an impression
on me. I was as close to him as I am to you now, or closer. I shook
hands with him, and I saw him more than for a fleeting moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I want to show you a picture and ask you if you can see any
resemblance between the picture I am going to show you and the man you thought
might be Oswald—this picture I am going to show you, the man is dressed up,
but if you can use your imagination to see if there is any resemblance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. To see if there is any resemblance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To see if there is any resemblance in the face, at least, and the
hair, and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No; Oswald’s hair isn’t that thick in the center.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I’m not talking about Oswald, I’m talking about the man you
saw at the club you thought might be Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No, sir; there is no resemblance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is no resemblance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let the record show that the picture that I have shown to the
witness has been identified as Exhibit 5302 in the deposition of Andrew
Armstrong. Do you know Captain Fritz of the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you had difficulties with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In what regard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. He sent two men to the place that I was working and had
them pick me up for investigation without a warrant, bodily remove me out of
my office, and held me on robbery by firearms, which I couldn’t have a writ of
habeas corpus that night, or something, I had to go before a judge or something,
and I didn’t get out until the next morning, and he didn’t even appear at the
hearing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long ago was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. That was in—I think it was March or April of 1961, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You haven’t seen him since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Well, when I had to go down to the police station, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean the next morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No; when I had to go down for questioning. No, he didn’t
even show up at the hearing there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know a man by the name of Jess Willard Lynch
[spelling] J-e-s-s W-i-l-l-a-r-d L-y-n-c-h?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I don’t think so—the name doesn’t sound familiar. I know
a Lynch, but Jess Willard Lynch?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What Lynch do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I know a Donald Lynch from school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is he in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long has it been since you have seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. High school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see—that is to say about 10 or 12 years ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Roughly—that name doesn’t sound familiar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a person by the name of Earlene Roberts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Earlene Roberts—I don’t remember whether I know her or
not. Closely, I don’t—I could have dated her or seen her, but closely, I don’t
remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I’ll put it this way, when I mention the name of Earlene Roberts,
do you associate it with anybody you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Well, I used to go out quite a bit in my life, and I went
with a number of people, and I was thinking that I dated one time a girl named
Earlene, but I don’t remember her last name—that’s why I stopped and hesitated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that’s the person whose image came to your mind when I
mentioned Earlene Roberts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know that Earlene Roberts, that I am talking about, is
the sister of Bertha Cheek?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. If she’s her sister, I was trying to think if I ever met
Bertha’s sister. I talked to her on the phone once. Bertha told me she had
two sisters, I believe, wait a minute—Earlene Roberts is the one that lives in
California, I believe, I believe it is, and Bertha went out to see her, maybe,
when Bertha went out to California 4 or 5 days on some business, and then I
was helping her remodel the home over there and painting then, and I think
I had to call her and I think Earlene Roberts was the person I called in California,
I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You called the person in California for Cheek?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. To talk to Bertha when she was out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Maybe October—maybe November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was after you were negotiating with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes, but I don’t remember the exact date. I knew that
name sounded real familiar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Bill DeMar, or have you heard of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. You will have to associate it with something for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, he was an MC at Jack’s Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Well, I don’t know that man. I saw him—he did a song
or something while I was there, but I don’t know him, if that’s who it is—I don’t
know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the story in the Press after Ruby shot Oswald
that he said that he had seen him at the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. I never knew of that—I never knew that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you been interviewed by anybody of the Commission’s staff
other than myself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. No, sir; the only people I have talked to is the Dallas Police
Force and to two FBI agents, and I didn’t have any knowledge that you would
talk to me until yesterday. They called long distance for me and he called me
this morning—I bowl in a scratch league on Thursday night and he told me I
had to be here at room 301 at 3 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, we pushed it up a little bit for you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Yes, Mr. Sorrels called me this morning and asked me if
I could make it earlier, and I said “I will leave on the flight 11:45 and I am
booked definite at 5:15 going back and on a standby on this one here.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you can make the 5:15 now, because you are through
right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>. Thank you very much. I enjoyed it. I will get to see my
wife for a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="NICHOLS">TESTIMONY OF ALICE REAVES NICHOLS</h2>
</div>

<p>The testimony of Mrs. Alice Reaves Nichols was taken at 2:15 p.m., on April
14, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Burt W. Griffin, assistant counsel of the
President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me state for the record that Mrs. Alice Reaves Nichols is
present, and before we began anything, she walked into the room and she asked
me if it would be possible to withhold her name from the press. I told her I
would check. I have talked with Mr. Hubert of our office, to find out what the
policy has been in the past, and he assured me that in the past we have, on the
request of witnesses, not released the name to the press. I stated previously
that all we have ever released is the name. We have never discussed and will
not discuss with the press any testimony. However, we can’t give you any
assurance that they won’t find out you were here. For example, there are
newspaper reporters all over this building, and I don’t recognize them and
perhaps you will, and perhaps they might recognize you or try to find out, if
they don’t recognize you, who you are. Unfortunately, anything they can learn
about what goes on is something that they want to print, so we can’t assure
you that the name won’t go out, but we can assure you it won’t get out from
anything we do. I am sorry we can’t give you any more protection than that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I appreciate that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me introduce myself. I am Burt Griffin, and I am a special
consultant to the General Counsel’s staff of the President’s Commission investigating
the assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>This Commission has been set up under a couple of governmental acts, one
of which is an Executive order issued by President Johnson on November 30,
1963, and another one from the joint resolution of Congress. The effect of
both of these acts has been to establish a Commission with a staff which has
power to subpena witnesses and take testimony and conduct an investigation
and prescribe various rules and procedures, and we are operating under these
rules of procedure.</p>

<p>I might explain that under the rules of the Commission I have been specifically
designated to come here and talk to you and take your deposition. Now
the purpose of this deposition is to inquire into all of the facts and evaluate
the facts and report back to President Johnson on the facts that have to do
with the death of President Kennedy and the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald.
In your particular case, Mrs. Nichols, you have known Jack Ruby for many
years, and you have been good enough to tell the FBI at some length what
you knew about him. We want now to see if there is any more that can be
added by this type of questioning. But we are also interested, I might add,
in anything you might know that might have any significance to the whole
investigation we are conducting.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I believe you got a letter from the Commission asking you to
appear?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I did. I had a telephone call first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. From Mr. Sorrels of the Secret Service?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; it wasn’t Mr. Sorrels. I believe the man said his name
was Howell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Howlett?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you receive your letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I received a letter last Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I might also say, I don’t want to scare you by saying
this, because we say it to everybody, that you are entitled under the rules
of the Commission to appear here with an attorney if you so desire, and it is
not unusual that people do that. But I see that you don’t have an attorney
here, and I take it that you don’t desire one.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I didn’t think it was necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Most people do feel that way. It is an expense, for one thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I know several attorneys here, but I didn’t think it was
necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, I don’t think anything will come up in the course of your
deposition that should make you feel you want an attorney. But I always
want to make clear that at any time throughout your deposition you are free
to stop the thing.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We try to be pretty nice, and I don’t think we will have too
many difficulties. Let me ask you then if you have any questions about the
deposition that is to be taken, before I ask you to raise your hand and be
sworn? Anything that you think you would want to know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; I don’t know of anything.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, would you raise your right hand.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give is the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you give the court reporter your full name.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Alice Reaves Nichols.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that Mrs. Nichols?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was your maiden name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. My maiden name was Small: Alice Reaves Small.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where do you live right now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. 8707 Redondo.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I hate to ask embarrassing questions of women, but could you
tell us when you were born?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes. February the 1st, 1915.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you lived in Dallas all your life?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I lived away from Dallas. I was born and raised here, but
I lived away about 7 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. From 1937 to about 1944.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you employed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where are you employed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Southland Life Insurance Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What do you do there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I am a secretary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you work for anyone in particular?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I am secretary to the vice president and treasurer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. John E. Mangrum.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now I want to ask you if you will hand me those two documents
that you have there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to mark them and ask you some questions in connections
with them. I want to hand you what I have marked as “Dallas, Tex.,
April 14, 1964, Alice R. Nichols’ Exhibit 5355.” This document consists of a
number of pages starting with the No. 283, at the bottom, going through page 291.</p>

<p>It purports to be a copy of a report of an interview that you had with two
FBI Agents, Mr. Albert Sayres and Mr. Paul Scott on November 25, 1963. I
am going to hand it to you and ask you if you had a chance to read that over
before the deposition started?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now is there anything in there that you feel is not accurate, an
accurate report of what you told the FBI on that day? I am not referring to
whether or not you, after thinking about it, that you make some changes, but
whether you noticed anything in there that does not accurately reflect what
you said at that time, and if so, whether you want to make some changes in it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. There are a few things in here that I notice that are not
exactly right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, let me ask you if you would refer to the page on which
the mistaken material appears, and if you would read the material that is mistaken
and then we will talk about it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I may have said it as it is here, but I know that I said that
I didn’t think that Joe Bonds had an interest in the Vegas Club. But after
thinking it over, I believe that he had for a short time an interest with Jack
Ruby. But I believe that at this time that I talked with the FBI men, I had
forgotten about that. But since thinking it <span class="locked">over——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you pick out of there what page that appears on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Let me put on my glasses. [Looks through document.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Maybe I can find it for you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I read it in there. It is in there some place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This would be on page 284. Let me read the language to you,
and you can tell me if that is what you had reference to.</p>

<p>The paragraph at the top of the page which reads: “During the time she was
associated with Jack Ruby, Ruby was friendly with one Joe Bond when he
operated the club on West Commerce Street in Dallas, Texas. She did not
believe that Ruby and Bond were ever associated in any business.”</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. That is it. Yes; that’s right, I believe for a short time that
Joe Bond had an interest in the Vegas Club with Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now has something happened since this interview, the original
interview that you had with the FBI that made you remember that or think
that Joe did have some business interest in the Vegas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I have just thought over the questions that they asked me, and
I recall that I believe that he did. I have been thinking it over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What makes you think that he did have?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, I think that Jack Ruby told me himself that Joe Bond
had an interest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What I am trying to get at here is, is there anything in particular
that made you remember this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; nothing in particular.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there anything else in this interview of November 25, that you
think ought to be changed or corrected?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now let me hand you what is marked for the purpose of identification
as Dallas, Tex., April 14, 1964, Alice R. Nichols’ Exhibit 5356. This
document consists of two pages, and it purports to be a copy of an interview that
you had with another FBI Agent, Mr. Albert Sayres. I guess you talked with
Sayers on the 25th, also, but this interview was on January 18, 1964. Have
you had a chance to read that over?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are there any additions or corrections you would make in that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now I want to go back, and I am going to ask you some questions
that are, some of which are biographical and some have to do with Jack
Ruby, and some helter-skelter. When did your husband die?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, I was divorced in 1947, but he didn’t die until 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did he do for a living?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. While we were married, he was with Commercial Standard
Insurance Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did he do after your divorce?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, I didn’t talk to him very often. He went into the insurance
adjusting business, his own business for a while. Then I understand
at the time of his death he was in the jewelry business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is a Nichols’ Garage here in town. Is that any relationship
to your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; it is not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I believe also that the building that Jack had the Carousel Club
in is owned by the Nichols’ family or by the Nichols’ estate.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes; I have heard that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that any relationship to your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; there is no relationship.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to meet Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I first saw him in a grocery store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. It was close to his Silver Spur nightclub, there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. South Ervay Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes. I was in a grocery store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you living in that general area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No. My mother lived close by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you never met him before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack come up and talk to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; he didn’t. I had my daughter with me, and later on
when I was waiting for the bus to go home, he saw me standing on the corner
and he came over and introduced himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About when was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. That was the early part of 1949. I don’t know the exact date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I think in your earlier interview with Agent Sayres on the
25th, you indicated that you thought you had met him in about 1948. Have
you had a chance to think since then so that your feeling now is that it was
1949?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t remember. I started going with him the latter part of
1949, and I don’t remember the exact date. It was several months after I
first saw him before I ever went with him. I would say it was 1948, winter of 1948
and 1949, somewhere in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, is there anything by which you place it? You mean that
would have been late 1948, or early 1949?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t remember the month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Any particular way that you place it at that period? Anything
in your life that is significant that would place it in late 1948?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; I can’t remember whether the weather was cold or what
I had on; whether I was wearing a coat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I mean the particular year. Anything happen during the year
1948 that sticks out in your mind so that you could date your meeting Ruby in
relationship to that event?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; I can’t remember exactly when I first met him, first saw
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How old is your daughter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. My daughter is 25.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So if it were 1948, she would have been about 9 years old?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes; that’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you started to date Jack, how often did you see Jack?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. It’s been so long ago. I think at first I probably saw him
about once a week, and then later on in the year or so, I would say about twice
a week, was about the most I ever saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Jack the kind of man that had any family interests or
seemed to show any interest in settling down?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, in settling down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; in getting married and raising a family and leading a
conventional kind of married life?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. He talked about it some for a period of time. Not all the
time I was going with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How would you describe Jack in terms of his impressions and
what he would look forward to and the kind of things he liked?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, I think that Jack had a lot of drive. He was ambitious.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
He was always looking for some way to make money, some extra way to make
money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there anything in particular that attracted you to Jack?
Made Jack attractive to you? Any particular quality about him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. He was very nice to me. He always treated me with respect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack, was he the kind of person that would unburden
himself to you with his personal problems and background?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, he talked to me about some of his problems. I don’t
know that he talked to me about all of them, but he did discuss some of his
problems with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of problems did he seem to have?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, his business problems. When he lost the Bob Wills
Ranch House, he discussed that with me. He was very upset about that. He
lost a lot of money in that deal. He had to go back to Chicago at that time, and
he discussed his business deals with me—when he bought the Vegas Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He didn’t seem to have any particular anxieties that he would discuss
with you? No personal problems; family problems?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, when his two brothers split up their partnership in
Chicago, he talked about that some to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did he tell you about that particular problem?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. He went back to Chicago that time to try to help settle their
differences.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know if this was Earl and Sam?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What seemed to be the differences between the two?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, I don’t know whether it was—well, I guess it was just a
financial, trying to work out. Sam sold out to Earl, and I think it was just trying
to work out a financial settlement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack ever indicate to you why Sam sold out to Earl? Why
Sam left the business?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I thought it was just because they weren’t getting along together,
the two brothers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack ever tell you why they weren’t getting along?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You saw Jack then on a once-a-week or twice-a-week basis until
about what, 1956 or 1957?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes; and then after that I only saw him about once a week.
I saw him about once a week until the latter part of 1959, about the latter part
of November 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How do you date that in 1959? What makes your memory remember
it as the latter part of 1959 as opposed to 1958 or 1960?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, the reason why I remember that is, I think it was Christmastime,
and we weren’t going together at Christmastime. I remember thinking
that I wouldn’t buy him a Christmas present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he own the Carousel Club at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; he hadn’t taken over the Carousel Club at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack ever talk to you about any trips he took?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. The only trips that I knew he took were a few trips to Chicago,
and I knew that he went to Havana one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many times did he go to Havana?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Only once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember when that was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. That was in 1959. It was September of 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What makes <span class="locked">you——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. The first part of September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What makes you remember it as that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, it seemed to me like it was around Labor Day, as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall how long Jack stayed in Havana?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Not exactly; but I would say he was there from a week to 10
days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he tell you why he went to Havana?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I thought it was a pleasure trip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see him off at the airport?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he tell you who he was going to visit in Havana?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. The only person he told me he was going to see in Havana
was a man by the name of McWillie. I don’t know if Mr. Mac was his first
name or whether McWillie was his last name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you ever met McWillie?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When had you met him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I had seen him a few times. Jack had introduced me to him.
I had seen him in the Vegas Club a few times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack indicate to you what McWillie was doing in Havana?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. He was managing the Tropicana Night Club, so I understood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now is this something that you actually remember yourself, or
something you know from having read about these things in the newspaper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; I remember him telling me that he was at the Tropicana.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack indicate whether he had any business interests with
McWillie?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. He didn’t indicate that he had any business interests.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack ever talk to you at any other time about Cuba or any
interests he might have in Cuba?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you feel that Jack talked to you about all of his enterprises;
business activities?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, I knew of nothing that he didn’t discuss with me. I
don’t know of any activities that he didn’t discuss.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, did you feel Jack was the kind of person who might do
things that he wouldn’t discuss with people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Discuss with people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; with other people who weren’t involved in that particular
activity?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t know. He always talked freely to me, I thought. I
never did feel that he—Jack was a big talker. He talks a lot; quite an extrovert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to break up with Jack?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. It was a gradual thing. We had no quarrel. We just quit.
He quit calling me. We just quit going together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now you indicated that Jack returned to Chicago from time
to time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. That was about August 1952.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How do you place it in August?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. As I recall, he lost Bob Wills Ranch House about April or
May 1952, and he stayed here several months, and it was around August, I
believe, when he returned to Chicago. And he stayed about 6 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you say he lost it, did he go into bankruptcy? Go
through some court proceedings or just sell it to somebody at a loss?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t know whether he took bankruptcy or not. I don’t
remember. I don’t think he got anything. I don’t believe he sold it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he forced out of it by anybody?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I was under the impression that he just didn’t have the money
to continue operating. He just had to leave it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of place was this Ranch House?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. It was a western type.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Restaurant?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; nightclub.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Striptease shows?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did Jack first go into the striptease business?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, I was not going with Jack when he got into the striptease
business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was the Silver Spur a strip joint?</p>

Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I believe he did for a time have a strip, a few girls doing
the strip at the Silver Spur, but that was a very short time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this while you were dating him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes; but not—that was just for a few months. Maybe not
even that long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did he happen to start to employ them there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. How did he what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why did he start to employ them there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, his business was bad and he was just trying to find
some way to build his business up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have entertainment at the Ranch House, Bob Wills
Ranch House?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Have floor shows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t believe he ever had a floor show. I never did see a
floor show there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have a band?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. He had a band.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And he sold liquor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes; well, they sold beer and set-ups.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was that located?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. That was on Corinth and Industrial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did he operate that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I can’t remember just when he started that. It wasn’t but a
few months. Probably, I would say about 6 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was the Silver Spur in operation when the Ranch House was
going?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, when he sold the Ranch House, what did he do with the
Silver Spur?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. He continued to operate both of them. Wait, I beg your
pardon. When he sold which one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The Ranch House?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. When he sold the Ranch House?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then what happened to the Silver Spur?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. He still had the Silver Spur when he sold the Ranch House,
but he sold the Silver Spur.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After he sold the Ranch House?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To whom did he sell the Silver Spur?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. A man by the name of Martin Gimbel or Gimpel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long after he sold the Ranch House did he sell the Silver
Spur?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. It was very soon. I would say within—doesn’t seem to me
like it—seems like it was about a month after he sold the Ranch House.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know—had you met Martin Gimpel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long had you known Martin Gimpel before he bought the
Silver Spur?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, I met Martin Gimpel soon after I met Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Martin living in Dallas at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes; he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did Martin continue to live in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t recall how long. I don’t recall how long he lived in
Dallas. Several years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Martin married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Not that I know of. I really don’t know whether he was
married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of man was Mr. Gimpel?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, I didn’t know him too well. I talked to him a few times,
but he seemed very nice to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know how he earned his living before he bought the
Silver Spur?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; I know that before, he had punchboards for a while, before
it became illegal in Texas, and that is the only business that I know of
that he had. I was under the impression that he had a little money, that he
had saved a little money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack ever sell punchboards in Texas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now I think you indicated to the FBI that Gimpel is dead?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. That is what I heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you hear that he died?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t remember. Jack Ruby called me and told me that he
had died, but I don’t know how long ago that was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he die here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No. I believe he said he died in Oklahoma.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As you have had a chance to sit here, Mrs. Nichols, do you recall
any better as to when it was that Gimpel died?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. It is since I started going with Jack Ruby, and it was several
years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you still going with Jack Ruby at the time he died?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; I was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. While you were dating Jack Ruby, how often did Jack see Mr.
Gimpel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, he was usually, he helped Jack around the nightclub, the
Silver Spur and the Vegas Club, and I used to see him when we would go in
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What sort of help would he give?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, he just would sort of manage it, see that everything was
going all right. I think I had seen him use the cash register. Just anything
that was needed to be done around there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, did Jack pay him for what he did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I believe you mentioned in your interview with the FBI that
Jack was friendly with a man named Rocky Robinson. Do you remember that
name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I never did see Rocky Robinson but about twice, and then it
was when we would be some place and he would be; we would run into him. I
never did see him with Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I think you indicated to the Bureau that you thought that Jack
sold the Silver Spur to Rocky Robinson?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now you have also testified that you thought he sold the Silver
Spur to Martin Gimpel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, now, he sold the Silver Spur to Martin Gimpel first, right
after he sold or right after he lost the Bob Wills Ranch House. He sold the
Silver Spur to Martin Gimpel, and he went back to Chicago and stayed 6 weeks,
and then he came back and took over the Silver Spur again from Martin Gimpel,
and then it was later on he sold the club to Rocky Robinson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. Why did Jack come back from Chicago?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, he told me that he liked Dallas. He wanted to stay here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, I presume when he left, did he intend to stay in Chicago
permanently?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I think that he did plan to stay in Chicago permanently when
he left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What happened in Chicago that made him change his mind after
he had been there for 6 weeks?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I thought it was because Martin Gimpel didn’t want to run the
Silver Spur and Jack had a chance to buy it back, and he came back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What makes you think that Jack actually sold the Silver Spur
to Martin Gimpel?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, he told me that he did. I don’t know what the consideration
was. He didn’t tell me how much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is Rocky Robinson still in town?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had Rocky been a friend of Jack’s before he sold the Silver Spur
to Mr. Robinson?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he become a friend of Jack’s after Jack sold the Silver Spur
to Rocky Robinson?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Not that I know of. I never did see Rocky Robinson but on
about two occasions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now I believe you told the FBI that you had met Jack’s father?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you meet Mr. Rubinstein?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Jack picked me up after I left the office and took me by to meet
his father one evening. That was the only time I ever saw his father.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did the father happen to be in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, he and one of Jack’s sisters were visiting Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When Jack sold the Silver Spur, did he also at the time he sold
the Silver Spur to Rocky Robinson, own the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In late 1958 and on up to the time you stopped seeing him in 1959
or 1960, did Jack own the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Did Jack own any club in addition to the Vegas Club during this 1-year period
prior to the time you stopped seeing Jack? Did he operate any clubs besides
the Vegas Club in that year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In that year before you stopped seeing him, did Jack ever discuss
selling the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t remember him ever discussing selling the Vegas Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it your understanding that Jack was making a profit off the
Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I suppose during the time that you were dating Jack, you met
most of his friends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Jack introduced me to a lot of people while I was going with
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you meet a man by the name of Dewey Groom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes; I knew him slightly. I met him. He was a bandleader
at Jack’s Silver Spur for a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After Jack closed the Silver Spur, did Jack continue to see
him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I never did see him after that. I don’t know whether Jack
did or not. Jack did see most of the nightclubs; he went around to most of
the clubs and he probably did see Dewey Groom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you know Ralph Paul?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To your knowledge, when did Jack first become friendly with
Ralph Paul?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, I don’t remember. Let’s see; I don’t remember whether—I
just can’t remember exactly when I first knew Ralph Paul.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he friendly with Ralph Paul when you first started dating
Jack?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; I believe I went with him for several years before I ever
heard of Ralph Paul or met him. I just don’t remember when I met Ralph
Paul. I was trying to think whether I remembered him before Jack went back
to Chicago. I believe I met him before he went back to Chicago in 1952.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have any business connections with Jack at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Jack had mentioned that Ralph Paul had loaned him money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was it, as you understand it, that Ralph first loaned
Jack money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t remember exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Mr. Paul ever have an interest in the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes; he had mentioned Gordon McLendon to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. While you were dating Jack, how often did Jack contact Mr.
Paul?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, I don’t know how often he contacted him. I would see
him around the club quite frequently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you say that Mr. Paul, during the period you were dating
Jack, was one of the more frequent visitors to the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Other than the lending of money by Paul to Jack, do you know
of any other business relationship that Ralph Paul and Jack Ruby had with
each other?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. While you were dating Jack, did you know George Senator?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; I never did know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know if Jack Ruby was a friend of Gordon McLendon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes; he mentioned Gordon McLendon to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you first hear Jack mention Gordon McLendon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t remember. I would say several years before we quit
going together, before 1959, maybe 3 or 4 years. I can’t remember when he
first mentioned him to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did Jack indicate to you about his acquaintanceship with
Mr. McLendon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, I think that he mentioned that Gordon McLendon had
given him some advertising time on his radio station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you understand it was free advertising time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. He didn’t say whether it was. I don’t recall him saying
whether he paid for it or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he know McLendon any way other than a business way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t know whether he went out with him socially or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Mr. McLendon ever visit the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I never did see him in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now did Jack ever mention the name of a man Stanley Kaufman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack know Mr. Kaufman when you began dating him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t believe he did. I never did hear him mention him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was the nature of Jack’s acquaintanceship with Mr.
Kaufman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, he was Jack’s lawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Jack a social friend of his?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t know. Well, I don’t know whether he ever went to
his home or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Mr. Kaufman visit the Vegas Club from time to time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t remember ever seeing him in the Vegas Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Tom Howard? Did Jack ever mention Tom Howard
as an acquaintance?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. He had mentioned Tom Howard, but I had never seen—as
far as I know, they were not friends. I never did see them together.</p>

<p>I never did see Tom Howard in the club. But I have worked for Tom
Howard when I first started working for attorneys, and I knew that I had
known Tom Howard because I worked for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you work for Mr. Howard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Right after I got my divorce in 1947, for a short time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then before you went to work for your present employer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You have been employed continuously with your present
employer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Since; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you work for Mr. Howard?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. About 6 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack ever mention Ed Pullman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Ed Pullman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t remember that name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he ever mention the name of Frank Fisher?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he ever mention the name of Alex Gruber?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Lawrence Meyers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Mike Shore?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Buddy Heard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, during the time that you were dating Jack, other than
the band that he would hire for his club, did Jack have business contacts with
the entertainment world?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Business contacts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. With the entertainment world?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t know whether I understand. You mean personal,
individual, or bands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; was it a regular practice of his to hire entertainers other
than the band to play at the Vegas Club? Singers and comedians or dancers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; he didn’t hire any. He had a little colored boy one time
who used to put on a floor show out at the Vegas Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that Little Daddy Nelson?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that the only entertainer that you knew of that Jack was
connected with while you knew him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now I believe you indicated to the FBI that Mr. Ruby was
very attached to his mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, he was devoted to his mother. He told me how—he
had remarked how much her death had hurt him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you able to tell whether he was more or less devoted to
his mother than to his father?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No. He seemed to be devoted to his father, too. He seemed
to be quite interested in his father’s welfare.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he ever mention to you in connection with his mother
that his mother had been a source of many problems to the family?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, he had mentioned that she had been in an institution;
that she had a mental breakdown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was Jack’s attitude about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. He didn’t say much about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have any hostility toward her on account of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; he didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack ever tell you how he happened to change his name
from Rubenstein to Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No. He had already changed his name when I first knew
him, and he never did tell me how he happened to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know that Jack had been associated with his brother
Earl and his brother Sam in a business in Chicago?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. He told me that he had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he ever tell you how he happened to leave that business
and come to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. He told me that he came down here because his sister had
a nightclub here and she was having difficulty because business was not going.
He came down here to see if he couldn’t help her with the nightclub business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he ever indicate anything about his relationship with Sam
and Earl in Earl Products?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. He was a partner, I understood, in that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he ever indicate that he was dissatisfied in any way with
that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; he didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he talk to you about how close he was or friendly he was
with his brothers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, I got the impression that he was close to his brothers,
his whole family. He seemed to be close to the whole family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What gave you that impression?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, he was very upset when his brothers Earl and Sam
broke up their partnership, and he went up there to try to help settle their
differences, and he just—I always got the impression that he was close to his
family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now you mentioned a man by the name of Ned Weisbrod.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As a person whom you thought was friendly with Jack, close
to him in one way or another. When did you first meet Mr. Weisbrod?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I believe that I met him soon after I met Jack. I would say
probably in 1950.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did they continue, Weisbrod, to be friendly with
Jack?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I had not seen him in—when I first knew Jack, he had the
Silver Spur, and I used to see Ned in there.</p>

<p>And after he took over the Vegas, I used to see him out there until about—I
think it was about the last 2 or 3 years I had not seen Ned in there. And the
same thing with this Sam; that they used to be together a lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Sam Lassen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes. I had not seen either one of them in the Vegas Club for,
I would say, 2 years anyway before 1959, when we stopped going together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack ever indicate why they stopped coming around?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there any sort of quarrel that Jack had with them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack seem to have any business relationship with Weisbrod
and Lassen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were Weisbrod and Lassen more friendly with Jack than Ralph
Paul? Did you see them around more often than you saw Ralph Paul?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now you also mention Adrian High as a person who was
friendly with Jack. And I believe, if my understanding is correct, that High,
Weisbrod, Lassen, and Ruby were sort of mutual friends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t know whether Adrian was a friend of Ned and Sam or
not. I have not seen Adrian High in, oh, since about, I would say about 1956.
I had not seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know if Weisbrod and Lassen are still in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was the last that you knew they were in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I haven’t seen them since—the only place I ever saw them was
at the Vegas Club, and it’s been several years before I quit going with Jack that
I had seen them in there. At least 2 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Jack the kind of person that, if he had problems with
somebody or a dispute with somebody, that he would continue to talk about
it for some time after it occurred?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. He didn’t talk to me about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You know some people, when they have a problem, they just
have to talk and talk about it until it seems to get out of their system. Did
Jack seem to be that kind of a person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; he didn’t talk to me about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you ever see Jack getting into any fights with anybody?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever see him hit anybody?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I never did see him hit anyone. I know that he had had
trouble in the club. I would hear about it. But I never did see him. I have
seen him put people out of the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear of his fighting with somebody socially, in a social
quarrel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The only time you know of his fighting or hitting somebody was
in connection with his acting as a bouncer for the club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I never did see him, but I heard of it. I know that he had
a finger—he was putting a man out of his club and a man bit his finger and
he had to have it amputated, but I was not there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you dated Jack, how much money was he accustomed to
carrying with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t know. I never did ask him and he never did tell me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever see Jack carry a gun with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I have seen him with a gun when he would have his moneybag
for deposit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is his practice? You have seen him take money out of
the club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now what was his practice? Would he have the gun at the
club, or where would he keep the gun?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t know whether he had it at the club or whether he carried
it in his pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever see him carry it in his pocket?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I never did ask him if he had a gun in his pocket, and he never
did tell me. I never did see him take it out of his pocket. When we would go
by the club, he would pick up the money and I would be sitting at a table, and
I don’t know when he got the gun, whether he got it out of his pocket or whether
he kept it at the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where would you see the gun; on the table or where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, I just saw it with the moneybag, and we would walk
out to the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He would carry it in his moneybag?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, I don’t remember ever seeing it in the moneybag, but he
used to put it on the seat with the moneybag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would he ever lock the money up in the trunk of his car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I never did see him do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now what did he use to do with his money after he took it out
of the club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, I thought he put it in a night depository. He would take
me home first, and I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You also indicated to the FBI that Jack was a gambler, liked
to gamble?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I never did see him gamble, but he told me that he—several
times that he had gone back to the Artists Club and played cards after he took
me home. I never did see Jack gamble. He never talked to me about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know who the owner was of the Artists Club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t know who owned it. A man by the name of Harris was
managing it. I think it was a musicians’ union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of gambling would they have at the Artists Club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I never did see them gambling there, but I imagine it was cards,
I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this <span class="locked">a——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. They served food there, and we have gone up there late to get
something to eat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they have a back room of some sort where they gambled?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t know. I never did see them gambling there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know who Jack gambled with there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how often would you say he would go there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, he only mentioned that to me for a short period of time.
I would say 3 or 4 months that he mentioned to me that he would go up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know a man by the name of Johnny Ross?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes; I have seen him in the Vegas Club a few times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I believe you described him as a gambler?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Jack told me that he was a gambler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know if Jack ever gambled with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Jack never did mention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of gambling did Johnny Ross do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack have any business association with Johnny Ross?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now Jack called you on the day the President was killed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long had it been before then that you had last seen Jack?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I had seen him on the street one time in the spring of 1963
I didn’t talk to him. He was driving the car and I was walking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Before the time that you saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. And before that, it had been over a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you talked to him on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; he had not called me in over a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now you told Mr. Sayres on the 18th of January that you remembered
that Jack had called you at about 2 o’clock on the 22d. How did you
happen to remember that at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. He called me sometime between 1 and 2, while I was out for
lunch and left his number for me to call him. And I called him back as soon
after 2, about 10 minutes after 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to know that Jack had called?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, I go to lunch from 1 to 2 all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But the first time that you talked with Mr. Sayres, you didn’t
remember apparently that Jack had called you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or did you remember at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, he didn’t ask me about it and I didn’t think about the
importance of it until this investigation or for the defense attorney asked me
about that, if Jack had called me on that day, and I remembered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did this investigator or one of Jack’s lawyers suggest that you
ought to call the FBI and let them know about this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No. I got to thinking about it myself and I thought I wanted
to keep the record straight. I wanted to let the FBI know it, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did the investigator indicate to you that you might testify for
Jack at the trial?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, no; he didn’t say. He didn’t tell me whether he thought
they would use me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have some idea that you might?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, after I talked, after the investigator, contacted me, I was
afraid that I might be called.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you ever called?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I didn’t attach the importance to the telephone call at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you testify at the trial?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you willing to testify?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I didn’t want to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was your reaction when you got this telephone call from
Jack shortly after the President had been shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, I was just, I was surprised when he—after the President
had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; that Jack had called you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes; I was surprised. We hadn’t been seeing each other and
I didn’t expect to ever hear from him again, and I was—he seemed to be upset
about the President’s assassination. I think everyone else was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why do you think Jack called you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t know why he called me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever question his attorney about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I haven’t talked to—never did talk to his attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you talked with Jack since then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or any members of his family?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. His sister-in-law has called me twice since that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would that be his sister-in-law?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. His sister-in-law, Sam’s wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever ask her why Jack called you that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; I didn’t ask her why.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did she ever indicate to you why he called you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you talked with Jack, when you called him back at around
about 2:15 or whenever it was, did you indicate to Jack that you were surprised
to hear from him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; I didn’t say anything to him about that, being surprised.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The FBI reports here, Mr. Sayres’ report in his interview of
January 18, that Ruby was apparently calling to tell you what a terrible thing
he thought it was that President Kennedy had been assassinated. Was there
some question as to what Ruby really, why he really was calling?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, I was just surprised to hear from him. I don’t know
why he called me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember what he said to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t remember the exact words, but the only thing, he just
talked about what a terrible thing the assassination was. It was a very short,
conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember any particular thing he said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or words that he used?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; I don’t remember the words, the exact words that he used.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you be able to tell me if he used the word, “terrible,”
there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t know whether he used the word, “terrible,” or not.
But generally it was just, he was just upset about the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he talk to you at all about the effect that the assassination
would have on his business?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he say anything particularly about President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, he was talking about the assassination of President
Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have any, did he say anything about what effect it would
have on the city of Dallas, the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t recall him saying that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now do you have a regular lunch hour?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is your regular lunch hour?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. From 1 to 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How do you place the time of the second telephone call that
Jack made to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. In the evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, it wasn’t late in the evening, and I had finished dinner
and had my dishes washed and I was reading the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time do you usually eat dinner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, I eat about 6.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was anybody living with you at home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; I live alone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how long does it usually take you to eat dinner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, I eat very slow in the evening. I usually listen to music
and I usually spend about 30 minutes, I would say. I take my time and drink
coffee and I sit at the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did he say to you when he called you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, he just was talking again about the assassination, and
he told me at that time that he was going to the synagogue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did he say about the assassination on the second occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, what a terrible thing it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, weren’t you again surprised that he should call you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ask him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; I didn’t ask him why he called me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you indicate your surprise to him in any way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I didn’t indicate it, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he indicate that he would like to see you sometime?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No, he never; I can’t recall him asking how I had been or
anything personal. He didn’t say anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he ask you how you felt about the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Well, I told him I thought it was terrible, too, and I was quite
upset about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he ask you for any advice of any sort?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; he didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You can’t think of any reason why Jack should have called you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The second time that he called you, did you have any indication
of where he was calling from?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; I have no idea where he was calling from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear any voices in the background?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Television set on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; I don’t remember hearing any noise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he tell you how soon he was going to the synagogue?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; he didn’t tell me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he tell you which synagogue he was going to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t believe he did. I assumed it was Shearith Israel because
that is where he went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you dated Jack, did Jack have any dogs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. He got his dog shortly before we stopped going together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But up until then, he had never owned a dog?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did he happen to buy the dog?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I think the first dog was given to him by someone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall who gave it to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No, I don’t know whether he told me or not. Or whether it was
anyone that I know. I just remembered where he got the dog, and it was killed.
It was run over a short while after he got it, so he got another one right after
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of dog was given to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. It was a dachshund.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was the next dog that he got also a dachshund?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Up until the time that his dog was given to him, had he expressed
any interests in dogs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. His sister had a little dog that he—I don’t know whether he—I
believe it seemed like he had taken care of it some for her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that Eva Grant?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes; she had a dog.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know a man by the name of Abe Kleinman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Yes; I believe he was a CPA or a bookkeeper. I believe he
kept Jack’s books, for a period of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Floyd Turman, do you know him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know any police officers with whom Jack was friendly?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; I have seen police officers out there in the club, but I never
knew one in particular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know any of the women that he was friendly with besides
yourself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I don’t know who else he dated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about women that he saw in a business connection? Did
you see any women in the business? Did he see any women in a business
connection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Not that I know of. I don’t know of any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you think of anything else that we haven’t talked about
here today that you haven’t already told the FBI, that you think would be of
importance to the Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No; I can’t think of anything that would be of importance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you if, as time passes here, and if anything does
come to your attention which you think might be helpful to us, if you would contact
somebody in the Commission or contact the FBI or the Secret Service and
let them know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I will be glad to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We also ask you, other than the interviews that Mr. Sayres had
with you, have you been interviewed by any member of this staff?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. Of this staff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Prior to having your deposition taken here, did you and I have
any interview?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don’t think I have any more questions to ask you.</p>

<p>I want to thank you for coming here and taking all this time to do it, and I
realize that you are a working woman and it is an inconvenience to you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. That is quite all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But it was quite nice of you to spend all of this time.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>. I am glad to help in any way I can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="PATTERSON">TESTIMONY OF ROBERT CARL PATTERSON</h2>
</div>

<p>The testimony of Robert Carl Patterson was taken at 4:15 p.m., on April 14,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Burt W. Griffin, assistant counsel of the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me introduce myself. My name is Burt Griffin, and I am
on the Advisory Staff of the General Counsel’s office of the President’s Commission
investigating the assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>This Commission has been set up by virtue of an Executive Order from President
Johnson which was issued on November 30, 1963, and also by virtue of a
Joint Resolution from Congress, No. 137.</p>

<p>As a result of these two official Acts, the Commission has been given authority
to put forth its own rules and regulations to accomplish the purpose of the investigation
which we have been asked to conduct, and under these regulations I
have been given authority to come here and take your deposition, Mr. Patterson.</p>

<p>I want to explain to you a little bit about what the purpose of the investigation
is. The Commission has been asked to investigate, evaluate and report back to
President Johnson upon all the facts surrounding the assassination of President
Kennedy and the subsequent murder of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>We have asked you to come here this particular day, Mr. Patterson, because
we understand that you have had some acquaintanceship with Jack Ruby.
However, we are interested in anything that you might be able to tell about the
assassination of the President or anything that you might think might be relevant
to that.</p>

<p>We have a certain set of procedures that we follow in conducting these depositions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
and in asking people to come here. I presume you got a letter, did you
not, from the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Signed by Mr. Rankin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes; I think it was. I have it in my pocket. That’s right.
(Referring to letter.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you get the letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Saturday, it was I got it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now also under the rules of the Commission I might explain to
you that anybody who desires to appear here with an attorney has the right to
do so, and we encourage people to do it. I notice that you are not here with
an attorney, and I take it it is because you don’t have any desire to have one.
However, if for any reason you think that you would want an attorney, or
as this interview progresses you think you should want to be represented by an
attorney, please feel free to tell me about it and we will postpone matters and
continue the deposition at a later date. I presume by the fact that you are
here without an attorney, that you don’t desire to have anybody represent you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Well, I don’t think I would need an attorney, because I don’t
think—I don’t know it was that important, so far as I was concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, I don’t see any reason why you should have one either,
but I want to tell you this so that you understand that you do have a right
to have an attorney, and I hope that if for any reason that you think you want
to be represented, feel free to state that.</p>

<p>Do you have any particular questions that you want to ask me about the
deposition that is about to begin before I ask you to be sworn? Feel free to ask
anything that comes to your mind, because I realize this is an unusual experience
for everybody who appears here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I don’t believe so other than how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long will it take? I don’t think it will take very long.
I want to ask you to raise your right hand and I will administer the oath.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give, will be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you give the court reporter your full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Robert Carl Patterson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where do you live, Mr. Patterson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. 902 East Waco Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you tell us when you were born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. March 13, 1944.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you presently employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where are you employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. The Beachcomber.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of place is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. It is a night club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What do you do at the Beachcomber?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Entertain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Musician and singer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What instruments do you play?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. My major instrument is the guitar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you sing any particular kind of songs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Well, I do mostly rhythm and blues and a few classicals.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you been an entertainer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Approximately 5 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you a high school graduate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes. I’m in college.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are going to college?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are attending college right now?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where are you attending college?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Arlington State.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that in the Dallas area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. It is in Arlington, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What are you majoring in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Music.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You were interviewed sometime in December by an agent of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Do you recall that interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At that time you indicated that you had worked on some occasions
for Eva Grant, Ruby’s sister?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you first work for Eva Grant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I don’t know the exact date. In fact, I can’t even recall the
month, but it was, I guess you could say, the last of the summer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This summer, 1963, was the first time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. 1963; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So the first time you worked for Eva Grant would have been
in the summer of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Approximately. As far as I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much would you receive for a one night engagement with
Mrs. Grant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Well, the pay varied from—I just played a one hour show,
say, about 10 or 15 minutes with a saxophone player. That is myself and my
band, and I would say the average pay I received was $8 for these 10 or 15
minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you sometimes receive more and sometimes receive less?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was the least you received?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. $4.00.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was the most that you received?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. $10.00.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many times did you play there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I don’t know for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you always appear with your saxophone player?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Eighty percent of the time I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they pay the saxophone player separately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they sometimes pay you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then you would pay the saxophone player?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are nodding yes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever consult with Jack Ruby or with Eva Grant about
playing at Jack’s Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No. It was my understanding that he had different type
music there than what I played.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How were you known to the Rubys; by what name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Mrs. Grant called me Bobby Patterson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you ever had occasion to talk with Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes, I talked with him several times about playing. He
wanted me to start playing in the Vegas, and we talked about salary and hours
and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Patterson, I am going to hand you what I have marked
Exhibit 5357, which is a photograph of a page out of that notebook, and I have
marked this photograph, Dallas, Tex., April 14, 1964, Exhibit 5357, Robert C.
Patterson, and I signed my name to it. Previously this same photograph has
been marked as Crafard Exhibit No. 5225, and as Armstrong Exhibit No. 5305-E.</p>

<p>I want to hand you this and ask you to look at the notations on that notebook.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
If you can’t read them, indicate to me that you can’t and I will try to read them
for you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I see Billy Brook. I can’t make out the second line. Bobby
Patterson, six something, special friend, and then a ten and two. No, and
quotation marks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You have to keep your voice up so she can hear you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Three ... I can’t make out that word—I can’t make out
the next word, and 2409 Maple. LA 6-7568 for Robert Patterson—no, Robert
is all.</p>

<p>Three—now I can’t make out the next—six eight three seven four nine
thousand eight, oh six, fifty by a hundred and ninety-two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize any of those notations shown in that photograph
as having anything to do with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. It would be my guess that these were some notations of
where he paid somebody, somebody paid us for playing one night, because I
think this Billy Brook is a singer. I remember Billy Brook that used to sing
over at the Vegas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he sing there while you also entertained there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes, a few times he was there. None of this other, I don’t
know what that could be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If that notation Bobby Patterson and friends had to do with
you, who would the friend be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Robert Simpson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that the saxophone player?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that a rate that was paid, six dollars to you and the
additional four dollars to Simpson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. It could have been. We usually received the same pay.
If I got $5, he usually received $5. I don’t ever recall making any more than
he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is as much as you can remember about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Has anything come to your attention in connection with Jack
Ruby or in connection with any of the work you have done for Jack or his
sister, Mrs. Grant, that you think would be of value to the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No, I can’t recall anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many times did you actually talk with Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I couldn’t pinpoint it to a certain number of times, but I
can approximate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you give us your best estimate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. You mean on the phone and in person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. About 15 times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many of these times would have been in person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Not 10 times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were all the times that you met him in person at the Vegas
Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where have you seen him besides at the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. He came to my house one night to talk to my mother about
me playing for him, and him taking over as my manager and promoting a record
for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Some time in the first of November, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of record was he interested in promoting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Just a rock ’n roll record that he wanted to promote for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you already cut the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I already record for another company and he said he had
some connections with a better record company that he could, you know, he
wanted me to record some new records.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who do you record for?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Future.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where is that office located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Arkansas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Arkansas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have to go up to Arkansas to cut the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No, we cut here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many records have you cut for Future?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you talk with Jack about promoting a particular song?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Not a particular song.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But about promoting you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did Jack say to you and what did you say to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. He said he had connections with Reprise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. R-e-p-r-i-s-e?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes. It is pronounced Reprise, with which Frank Sinatra
has something to do with, and never did say what Frank Sinatra had to do
with it, but he said he knew some people in this line that he would have no
trouble getting a record promoted and distributed nationally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was your response?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Well, I told him if he could get this done, fine, I would consider
recording for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he make an effort to have that recording done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No. He was trying to get me to play in the Vegas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In the Vegas or the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. In the Vegas. And I never did think too much about the
recording, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the time he talked to you about the recording, had you ever
played at the Vegas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, what do you mean he was trying to get you to play there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. The band he had was leaving, quitting, had quit already, I
would say, and they had been there a long time, for a number of years, and
they quit. And he wanted my band to start playing there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you feel about playing at the Vegas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Well, I didn’t really want to because the pay was too low
and the hours were too long. But he propositioned me to cut the number of
hours because I was going to college, and the other saxophone player was
too going to college, and the other two guys worked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So did you finally agree to play at the Vegas with your band?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was the last that you talked to him about playing at the
Vegas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. About—I don’t know the exact—it was one Sunday evening,
I would say, approximately two weeks before the incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Before the assassination of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Could have been a week and a half or a week anyway in
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At that time Jack didn’t have a band playing at the Vegas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He did have a band?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes. He had hired one band and one band had quit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He hired another one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But the plan was that he would have had your band replace
the one that was already playing there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever talk with Jack Ruby any place except at your
house and the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Well, he came out to hear us. We were playing at SMU
college and he came out to hear the band.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. This was the same Sunday that I talked to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Any other places that you talked to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Well, I had an interview on the radio one night at the Circle
Bowl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Circle Bowl; bowling alley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What radio station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. KBOX.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to be interviewed there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. It was the first night I met Jack Ruby. I was playing at the
Vegas. I did the show, and Mrs. Grant called me over and introduced me to
him, and he said, “I like the way you play. Do you want to talk on the radio?”
So I said, “Sure.” So he said, “Follow me,” and me and Robert Simpson followed
him over to the Circle Bowl, and Jack West was doing his night program
and he interviewed me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. It was the first night that I met him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Back in the summer sometime, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No, I didn’t know him, but I would say a month or month and
a half at the most prior to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But he called or spoke to you either in person or on the telephone
about 15 times in that month or month and a half?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes. I mean in the same day and stuff like that, you know,
on different occasions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now on any of these occasions that you saw him in person, did
he have anybody else with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes. The night I met him, he had somebody else with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At SMU?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No. I met him at the Vegas Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did he have with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. He introduced me to a guy that was entertaining at the Carousel,
Billy DeMar. I think that is the last name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was anybody else with him that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. A little short guy. I don’t know his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he a Negro boy or a white one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I think he was just—he was an old man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how old a man would you say he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I would say he was in his late forties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How tall was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. About my size, about 5’2”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was his build, heavy, medium or thin man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. For his size, he was kind of fat. Stomach went like that
[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he balding, or did he have all of his hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I think he was balding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember if he wore glasses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he appear to be a business associate of Jack Ruby’s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I couldn’t tell. I didn’t ride in the same car with him or
nothing. I just saw him with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This other fellow didn’t do any of the talking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Well, we were talking about promoting the record and he said,
“Jack will put you over, don’t worry.”</p>

<p>He says, “If he likes you, he likes you, and if he don’t like you, he don’t like
you.” I remember him saying that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever see this man again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No, I never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever meet any other people with Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. His roommate, George. I don’t remember his last name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you meet George?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. At their apartment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to go up to Jack’s apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Well, it was the same night that he came over to SMU to
listen at us, and he said, “What are you fixing to do?”</p>

<p>I said, “I am going home.” It was on a Sunday after we got through playing
and he said, “Why don’t you come by and let’s discuss, you know, the pay that
I would pay you and the hours and so forth.” So he didn’t live too far from
my house, and we stopped by there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You and your trumpet player?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No, just me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And Jack—was Senator with Jack at SMU?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was George, was he with Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At SMU?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So when you got to Jack’s apartment, the roommate was there,
George?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was anybody else there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. The dog, and another woman and a man came in. I had seen
her over to the club working. I guess she was related to him in some way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You had seen her at the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would it have been Mrs. Grant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What time of the night did this man and woman come in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I guess it was around 8 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain at the apartment that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. About 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you notice anything unusual about the apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No. Just an apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that the only time you ever saw George?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long before the assassination of the President was it that
you went to Jack’s apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Approximately 2 weeks or 2½, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And it is your recollection that this was a Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you have any record at home from which you could determine
when that was? Any record of being paid at SMU which would indicate
when it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The man who came into the apartment that Sunday night with
the woman, how old a man did he appear to be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I don’t recall, but I would say he was in his middle thirties
or maybe 40. I didn’t pay that much attention, because I don’t think I ever
seen him before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he appear to be a Jewish man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I don’t know. I don’t think I ever heard him talk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How tall do you recall him being?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Maybe 5’ 11”, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about his build, fat, medium, thin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. He was fairly thin, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That was the only occasion that you were ever in Jack’s apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you meet him any other places?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever meet any of the people who worked at the Carousel
Club outside of Billy DeMar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you think of anything else that you could tell us about Jack
Ruby, about your meetings with him or acquaintanceship with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Well, like I say, I hadn’t known him but about a month and
a half. Maybe a month. It might have been 3 weeks prior to this incident, and
I didn’t know him that well, but he was trying to get us to play over there, because
a band he had had for so long had left, and the one he had wasn’t doing
as good a job as he felt they should, and having a lot of trouble. Actually, my
business dealings with Jack were with Mrs. Grant, and he came in one night
while I was performing and she called me over and introduced me to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Patterson, I want to hand you a copy of a report that the
FBI made after the interview with you on December 16, 1963. It is a copy of
an interview report made by Special Agent James E. Garris, FBI, and pertains
to an interview with you on the 16th of December 1963.</p>

<p>I don’t know if you had a chance to read it, but, if you would, read it over and
tell me if there are any additions or corrections that you would make to that
other than what you have already told me here today, and also, if you would,
indicate to me if that is a true and accurate report of the interview that you
had with Mr. Garris? [Document marked Patterson Exhibit No. 5358.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. This part where it says intermittently for several years, I
wouldn’t say it was several years. More like a year, maybe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now you indicated to me that the first time you ever worked for
Eva Grant was back in the summer of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That wouldn’t even be a year. Is there something that makes
you think that you worked for or knew her even before then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Sure. All the bands, more or less. I mean, knew of the
place, you know, because I had a friend, Joe Johnson was playing there, and
occasionally we would stop by and sit in, play a few numbers, so <span class="locked">therefore——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. I guess that is what I meant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then you would qualify the statement which reads as follows:</p>

<p>“He has worked for Eva Grant, Jack Ruby’s sister, at the Vegas Club in Dallas
intermittently for several years as a guitar player and singer.”</p>

<p>You would state instead that for maybe a year before this interview on December
16, you had visited the Vegas Club occasionally to see your friend Joe Johnson,
and that on those occasions you had sat in with Joe Johnson’s band?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But that you never actually began to work there for money until
the summer of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes; I couldn’t pinpoint it whether it was the summer, beginning
or end of the summer, really. I don’t actually recall. I would have to go
back and get—she put a few advertisements in the paper with my name, and I
can go back and look at them. I don’t remember, I played so many places.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you belong to any musicians’ union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes; I did once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you a member of any union when you were playing for
Eva Grant at the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any agent at the time you were playing for Eva
Grant at the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, you said already that you don’t have anything more that
you could add, and I take it that there is nothing more that you would change in
this interview report, is that correct? Or would you make some more changes in
the interview report other than what we have already discussed today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. About Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, or about anything that appears in this interview report.
You hesitate like you think there are some other things you could tell us. Let
me encourage you to come forward and tell us everything that you do know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Yes, this is all I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. I would like to ask if you in the future, or if you should
remember anything or anything should come to your attention which could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
of any assistance to the Commission, please get in touch with the Commission or,
if it would probably be easier to get in touch with the FBI or Secret Service, let
me know what it is.</p>

<p>I appreciate your coming out here this afternoon and speaking with us. You
have had to wait around a long time to get here, and I certainly want to apologize
for inconveniencing you and tell you again that we appreciate very much the
time you have given us, and the help you have provided here, and it’s been very
nice meeting you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="PAUL">TESTIMONY OF RALPH PAUL</h2>
</div>

<p>The testimony of Ralph Paul was taken at 8:03 p.m., on April 15, 1964, in the
office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President’s
Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Mr. Ralph Paul.</p>

<p>Mr. Paul, my name is Leon Hubert, I am a member of the advisory staff of
the General Counsel of President Johnson’s Commission to investigate the death
of President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.
Under the provisions of Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, issued
by the President’s Commission, the Joint Resolution of Congress No. 137, and
the rules of procedure adopted by Congress in conformance with that Executive
order and joint resolution, I have been authorized to take a sworn deposition of
you, Mr. Paul. I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission’s
inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate, and report upon the facts related to the assassination
of President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey
Oswald.</p>

<p>In particular as to you, Mr. Paul, the nature of the inquiry tonight is to determine
what facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other pertinent
facts you may know about the general inquiry, and about Jack Ruby and his
associates, and his business and social friends and so forth. Now, I believe you
have appeared here as a result of a letter written to you by Mr. J. Lee Rankin, the
General Counsel of the Commission, advising that we would be here and requesting
that you appear. Was that letter received by you more than 3 days ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you stand up and take the oath, please? Do you solemnly
swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Paul, will you state your name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Ralph Paul.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how old are you, Mr. Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I will be 65 this December.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you reside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Right now I live with some friends—I’m building a house in
Arlington, 1602 Browning Drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The letter of request to appear was addressed to the correct
place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; both places.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand that you are the owner or manager, and that is
one of the things we want to clarify, of the Bull Pen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I am the owner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are the owner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that a corporation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the name of the corporation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That is Bappo [spelling] B-a-p-p-o.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is Bappo, Inc., isn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that is a closely held corporation, I take it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. <span class="locked">Well——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean, do you own all the stock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And, of course, the corporation owns the business and you manage
the business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have any other occupation at the present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you lived in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. In Dallas—itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, let’s put it in the Dallas area, first. I mean—Dallas-Fort
Worth area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Okay—I came in December 1947.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you live prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. New York, New York City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In New York City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I think that you originally are an immigrant, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That information, I believe is information in the statement you
have given.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall what it was that caused you to come to Texas
from New York?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I was connected with some show people and they came down here
and told me how great Texas was, and I came down, and in fact I came down
and leased the club, leased the Sky Club at first, and we stayed there a month
and then we bought it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Leased which one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. The Sky Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was in 1947?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s actually in 1948, I mean, I came to Dallas 2 days before
New Years or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Two days before New Years in 1947, so it’s practically 1948?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any connections here when you came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No—I didn’t know anybody here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say “we”, you mean you and your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No—that entertainer and her husband brought me down here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What were their names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Joe Bonds and Dale Belmont—it’s also in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They were husband and wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And they had been here before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. They had been here before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And they interested you in coming into this area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you leave all your business and social connections in New
York?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; not at that time I came down from New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have been married since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are not married at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never have been married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And is your wife dead or are you divorced from her?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. We got divorced in 1931.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you have never remarried?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you supposed to supply capital to the venture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. What venture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With Joe Bonds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you say it was in a very short period after arriving here
you got interested in a place called the Sky Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; they interested me to come down here—they interested me to
come down here and rent the Sky Club from a man called Satterwhite, and
after we stayed there a month, he decided to sell it to us and then is when we
bought it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who put up the capital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. We put up some capital—the rest of it was by notes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was the corporation formed then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, it was owned by you and Bonds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Ralph Paul and Joe Bonds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Half and half?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did that venture last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I sold out my interest in May of 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, it lasted a very short period of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whom did you sell it to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I sold it to a man from Miami that came up here looking for
business—I can’t think of his name—Rosenheim.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember his first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I think it’s some place in this—that is, his first name is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s all right, we will get to that. What sort of place was
the Sky Club—what was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. A nightclub.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was it located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. On the Fort Worth Cutoff. I think the address was six something
Fort Worth Avenue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What venture did you go into after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I opened up a bar in downtown Dallas called the Blue Bonnet,
underneath the Blue Bonnet Hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you rent the premises there and operate the bar yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any partners in that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you maintain that occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I maintained it close to 5 years. I opened it in November and
sold it 5 years later in September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you would have opened it in November 1948?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you would have sold it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. In September 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 1953?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; 1953—that’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what did you do after 1953?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, I didn’t do nothing for several months and then I and
Chris Semos opened up the Miramar Restaurant on Fort Worth Avenue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was a partnership too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; that was a partnership.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was not a corporation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, this Chris Semos, did he put up the money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. We both put up some money and the rest was notes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what was the name of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Miramar Restaurant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was a restaurant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And nightclub, was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, just a restaurant and drive-in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you operate that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Close to 3 years—about 3 years less 2 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that you operated that until, say, July <span class="locked">of——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; I operated that until February.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of what year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Of 1957.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you sell that, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I sold it to Chris Semos.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You sold the whole thing to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you take a note from him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I notice that in your income tax returns for some later years
you show interest received from Chris Semos of about $250 a month; is that
interest on that note?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; it’s $125 a month for seven years, that includes $100 a month
payments and $25 interest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I beg your pardon—that’s what I meant to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s $250 a year—and one time it was $250 because he wouldn’t
pay 2 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The interest you show as received, I said $250 a month, I meant
to say it was $250 a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s right, $250 altogether, and one year he didn’t pay full so
it was only $250.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that loan paid out now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, in February of 1957 you didn’t have any business connections?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir. I went into partners with Jack Ruby’s brother, Sam,
and in a little ice cream place. We opened up April 25, 1957, and closed it—we
didn’t close, we gave the lease away so they wouldn’t hold us responsible
for the lease, and we lost some money because the fixtures that we bought
was more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you operate that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. May, June, and July.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just a few months?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. We saw it didn’t make, so there was no use in wasting time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your next business venture then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Next, I didn’t go in business, I was helping Jack Ruby in the Vegas
Club from August until the following year—May.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. August of what year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. August 1957, to May 1958.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were with Ruby, you say, at the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; I just was helping him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean on a salary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, no—it wasn’t really a salary. I helped him out on Friday
and Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you receive any compensation at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, the only compensation I received he owed me some money,
he paid me back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, perhaps at that point then we should go back to—so
that you may tell us when you first met Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Like I said over here, it was one of these improvised meetings
that you meet somebody that comes over to you and introduces himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was it, about; do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. 1958.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In 1958?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I mean, in 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In 1948?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Those years fly back so fast, 1948. That’s the year I was up
to the Sky Club yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he simply came over and introduced himself to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; he says, “I’m Jack Ruby. I own the Silver Spur.” I don’t
think it was known as the Silver Spur, but I can’t recall the name it was
known then. It keeps on running in my mind that it wasn’t the Silver Spur—it
was another name, but I can’t remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it the Singapore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was the Singapore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he told you he was the owner of the Singapore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And subsequently that became the Silver Spur.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any business connections with Ruby at all until
he got to owe you some money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, I’ll tell you the whole thing—the whole story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; that’s best—that’s the best way to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, one day he came in with a friend of his—he’s now deceased.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If you could fix the time and place—as you go—it would be
helpful, and I know it’s a long time ago but perhaps we will have to take an
approximation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Maybe it was 1949 or 1950 or 1951, I can’t remember those years,
and he asked me for a loan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember what the friend’s name was? The one that
he came in with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. He’s now deceased, but it was Marty Gimpel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the two of them came to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And wanted to borrow some money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much was it they wanted to borrow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. $2,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you lend it to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. He said to me, “I’ve got a show, I want to buy the Bob Wills
Ranch House”—did you get this one in there any place—he said, “I’ve got
to show it,” and he says, “All I want to do is show them that I’ve got the money
and I’ll give it back to you the following day.” Well, not that I knew the guy
so much, but you know, you can’t turn people down like that if he wants to pay
me the next day, so I loaned him $2,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you get a note?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; he was going to pay me back the next day. Well, the next day
didn’t come. Subsequently he roped me in for $3,700.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean—more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. With the $2,000—$3,700 altogether.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Making $1,700 more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, why don’t you just tell us in your own words just how
this relationship developed and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. It’s silly but true, and when I tell it, it’s really funny. The next
time he comes he says, “They didn’t think it enough money to show for the
place, I’ve got to show them $3,000,” so I gave him another $1,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would have been just a few days after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes—that’s 2 days afterwards. Instead of the next day coming—he
came 2 days and he says, “This is it positively—I’ve just got to show them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
the money.” Well, he didn’t come around that Saturday, and subsequently
he came around and he said he had to use the money to get into the business
there. What do you do with a person—you’re just stuck. You can’t do nothing
until then—you can’t do nothing with them. That went on for a couple of
months, and now, listen to this: One day, on a Friday—that’s how the other
$700 is going to come in—on a Friday he comes in and he says, “If I don’t get
the money to buy beer, I’ve got to close it down.” Well, you’ve got to think—you’re
already stuck with $3,000—that’s how the payments came when I was
with him at the Vegas Club—you understand me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; so, you gave him another $700 on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; but when he sold the Silver Spur at that time, he gave me
money back, because I have the note on the Silver Spur. He gave me the
note on the Silver Spur for the money, so in order to release the note, he gave
me $1,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, that’s a different transaction from the $3,700; is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s from the $3,700. You see, I took a note afterwards, when
he went bankrupt—when he went with the Bob Wills Ranch House, he gave
me a note on the Silver Spur.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. For what amount?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. For the $3,700.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Up to that time you didn’t have a note, but when the Ranch
House <span class="locked">folded——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Folded—it didn’t fold, his partner bought him out—the two of
them—he couldn’t—he didn’t get any money out of it anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, he went into the Silver Spur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; he was in the Silver Spur before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was in the Silver Spur already?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was in both?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; he was in both.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you got him to give you a note to show the $3,700?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. But when he sold it, I think he sold it for $2,200, or $2,700, but
he had to pay so many people that he gave me a thousand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, when he sold the Silver <span class="locked">Spur——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I had to give him the note—he couldn’t sell it without the note.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was the note secured in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; it was registered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A registered note, which made it a lien against the Silver Spur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that if he was going to sell it to anybody he had to clear the
note, he had to get some sort of cancellation as to registration and that required
the note?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I gave him the note.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you gave him the note for $1,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That left $2,700 still owing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Not exactly $2,700—he paid me in little sums like 50 or 100—I think
it left about $2,200.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. At that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And, of course, you had no more note?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; but when I helped him at the club, he gave me $50 or $25 or
anything he could get ahold of to give me, so that eventually the note went
down to $1,200, and that’s what it remained on that deal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, from August 1957 to May 1958, you helped out
at the Vegas, which he was then operating?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The Silver Spur had gone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then the indebtedness got reduced to about $1,200 you think
as of May 1958?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there any further story to that note, or is that money still
owing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That money is still owing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That has never been paid?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you have no note for it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, after May 1958, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I bought into the Bull Pen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was with Semos?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, no; that was with Bowman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With Bowman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Bowman had a partner, and he got a notice from the building
department—what is it, VA or something like that—they wanted him—as an examiner,
so he sold out to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, originally you and Bowman were in as a partnership
alone, or was it a corporation when it started?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, no; when I bought this man out it was a stepfather then—when
I bought him out—Bowman and I were partners—50-50 partners. Then
we made it a corporation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the year of the incorporation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I think it was 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 1960, but you had operated prior to that as a 50-50 partnership
with Bowman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, you became a corporation and when did you buy out Bowman
completely so that you are now full owner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. January 1, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, after you left this association with Ruby in May of 1958,
did you have any further business or social relationship with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; we were friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had been friends actually for that time almost 10 years,
hadn’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; we were friends from the time he loaned the money from me,
let’s put it that way. We had to be friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him quite often?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did that come about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, the nights I had off, you see, we used to work 1 day and 1
night with my partners. If I worked nights, the next day he worked nights, so
we swung it around, so the nights I had off, either I would go to the Vegas
Club—at that time he had the Vegas Club alone, and after that we would go
out to eat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was his sister, Eva Grant, with the Vegas at that time? At the
very beginning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did she come in, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. When he opened up—not the Carousel, but the first one—which
one was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The Sovereign Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. The Sovereign Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What year was that—about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. 1959 or 1960—I think it was 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you known her before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Just a casual acquaintance, you know, I mean—I must have seen
her once or twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She didn’t live in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; I think she was out on the road some place selling merchandise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any further business relations with Sam Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; just that ice cream place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s all you ever had with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, did you ever have any financial interest in the Vegas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t now and never have had any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have any, or have you ever had any financial interest in
the Sovereign Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Actually—no—not interest at that time, but when I loaned him
money on the Sovereign Club, that was after he went out with his partner. He
and his partner couldn’t get along—Slayton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was Joe Slayton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They had started the Sovereign Club and they couldn’t get along
and Jack needed some money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You loaned him some money, then, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, I think I loaned him for 3 months’ rent or 4 months’ rent—$550
a month, because that was the time he couldn’t pay the rent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You loaned that in cash?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; I give him a check—not in cash.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You gave him a check?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. A check—I gave him a check.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he give you any evidence of indebtedness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; the following year he gave me 50 percent of the club, telling
me that if the thing don’t go, the fixtures and everything should represent my
money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had no note about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; he gave it to me—I knew about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; but did he give you a note?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there any kind of written agreement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. It was a stock receipt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was a corporation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he gave you a stock certificate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember how many shares it was for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Five hundred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that half of the corporation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Half of the place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he endorsed that over to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes, yes; I think he did—he and Slayton—I think did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what was the consideration, that is to say, what money did
you pay for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. To open up the <span class="locked">Carousel——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I’m talking about the Sovereign.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. The Sovereign was no consideration—just the stock deal, that if
anything happens to the club I should get some money out of it for the fixtures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, as a matter of fact you had actually loaned him 4 months’
rent at $550, whatever that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. About $2,200.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; $2,200, so, was it considered that that loan or that indebtedness
was the consideration for the stock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or, was the stock merely to secure it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s the security of that money—the stock was the security of the
money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, if he had paid the money back to you, he was
entitled to the stock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s right. In fact, he took the stock certificate one time; he
thought he would be able to sell the club.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. He thought he would be able to sell the club, so I give him the stock
certificates; you know—you deal with people in money, that’s true, and you are
very careful, but sometimes friendship overshadows a lot of things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I gather from what you say there that therefore there was a
close friendship between you and Jack. Did you continue during that time on a
friendly basis; that is to say, visiting at the Vegas or Sovereign Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; we were always friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You think you saw him two or three times a week during that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would be from 1958 on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; prior to that I saw him a lot of times before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Jack was never married, was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was the Sovereign located? Was it the same place as the
Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know anything about the changeover from the Sovereign
to the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Oh, yes; I forced him to change that over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; tell us about that, if you can tell us the dates and
times, as close as you can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. And, he needed money; the Sovereign Club was dead, as far as he
was concerned. Either he closed it or—either he closes it or he does something
else with it. So, I told him to change it to a burlesque house and I will give him
$1,650 to pay more rent on the place so he could go on, so I loaned him $1,650
more to turn it over to a burlesque. That’s when he changed it from the
Sovereign Club, a private club, to a burlesque house, which was an open place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, with the Sovereign Club you had to belong to
the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Sort of a bottle club, as required by the laws of Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s right; he had a bottle club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If you belonged to the club, you could buy liquor in the club, and
if you didn’t you couldn’t, and it was your thought that the thing could be a
success if its nature were changed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; well, it’s an open place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It’s an open place, a burlesque house, but, of course, you couldn’t
sell hard liquor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But it would sell beer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But your proposition to him was that you would advance $1,650
in the new venture to at least pay the rent for some time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know anything about the incorporation of the S. &amp; R.,
Inc.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; the S. &amp; R. started the thing. That was the first deal; S. &amp; R.
is Slayton and Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say “the first deal,” are you speaking of the corporation
that existed with reference to the Sovereign Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you aware that there was a corporation called Sovereign,
Inc., that owned the Sovereign Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you told me that he endorsed over as security 500 of
the shares?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was not the S. &amp; R. shares with the stock certificates, was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. The S. &amp; R. was the Sovereign Club. The original Sovereign Club<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
was the S. &amp; R., because Slayton didn’t belong to anything else but the Sovereign
Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me see if I can get this straight; you mentioned that in
order to start the Sovereign Club you advanced $1,650?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; that’s after Slayton went out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After Slayton went out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Jack Ruby owned the whole thing then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you loaned him 3 or 4 months’ rent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In return for which he pledged to you or gave you as security
500 shares of the stock of the corporation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But I want to know what corporation was that; was that the
Sovereign?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. S. &amp; R.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what year would that have been in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. In 1959 or 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, apparently you were not aware that there was a Sovereign,
Inc.; a corporation called Sovereign, Inc.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; all I knew was that it was the S. &amp; R.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, when the place was changed to the Carousel, what happened
to your 500 shares?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. It’s still the same thing; Carousel is only a name. It’s still S. &amp; R.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you still have those shares?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; I gave them over to his sister.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. February 14.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of this year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you had held those shares, half of the ownership, as it were,
of the Sovereign Club originally, and subsequently the Carousel, until recently?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did you get any income from the corporation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you get any kind of pay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of any sort; Jack never paid you any money through the years
at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. He never paid me a dime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I gather from that that he stands owing you now $1,200,
which was left from the original debt, about $2,200 that you loaned him for
which you got a security—500 shares of a corporation—and then another $1,650
that you loaned him in order to open up the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A total of about $5,050, and is it your thought that he still owes
you that much money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, what am I going to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I just wanted to find out just what the picture was, as to that. He
never paid you any dividends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. He never had any money to pay me dividends; he always used to
work from his pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go to the Carousel very much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes, sir; once or twice a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you usually go on Saturday nights?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Not every Saturday night; mostly Friday nights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is some evidence that on those occasions that you went,
there were some sort of payments made to you, Mr. Paul, and that’s what
I want to find out, if there were any. I don’t know what the nature of them
was; that’s why I’m asking you about it. If there were payments on a loan or
payments because of your ownership of the Carousel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Not that I know of; not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, your statement to me is that Jack Ruby never
paid you any money at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; that’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Either in the way of repaying the loan or in the way of dividends?
Or in the way of profits?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. In the first place, until the last year that he was there, he was
losing money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. At the Carousel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did it make some money in the last year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. In the last year I think it made some money, but he was so much
in the hole that he had to pay everybody else. When he was arrested—now,
mind you, when he was arrested—you wouldn’t think that an electric company—you
could owe them that much money, but there was $175 or $180 a month, and
he owed them over $600.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The electric company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; the electric company—Dallas Electric Lights, and the telephone
company—$153. He kept on owing everybody money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, in any case, you didn’t get any payments of money from
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. For your share of what any profits might have been or dividends
or interest or repayment of loan or in any way at all; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you say that you gave the 500 shares that you held up
until February 14 of this year to Eva Grant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you tell us why you did that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, for one reason, I couldn’t run the club; I tried to run it, but
I couldn’t run it. I lost about $3,000 in the time I run it from the 25th of November
until the 14th of February.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever find out who owned the other 500 shares?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I don’t know; I was never interested to know all the other facts,
because I never figured to get any money out of the place anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know Earl Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s Jack’s brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you ever met him prior to November 24 or November 25?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. In Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he come here often?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir; I think I met him twice or three times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In your whole life, until the 25th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Until the 25th, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have any interest in the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I couldn’t tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does he claim any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I still don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know his brother Hyman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; I met him one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just one time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. The Friday before the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before the murder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never met him before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about his sister, Eileen?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know her at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I never heard of her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I think he has another sister called Mrs. Anna Volpert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; I don’t know her, either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never met any of the other brothers and sisters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; Sam and his wife, and Eva and Earl, and that’s all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then Hyman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Sam, of course, you have seen more often than any of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Oh, yes; Sam—well, we were partners for about 3 or 4 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; but you had no other business relations after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, can you tell me why it was that this man owed you this
kind of money and you had the stock at least for security for something; you
gave it to Eva; what caused that to come about; did she ask you, or did you
volunteer to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; I voluntarily gave it to her so she could sell the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, your thought was that it wasn’t anything to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I told her, “I don’t want nothing out of it; I don’t want nothing,
I take my loss.” And I let her have it. If she could sell it—to take the money
and use it for herself, because she’s a poor widow and she will verify everything
I said—just the words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did she tell you that she had the other 500 shares?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; she just told me last week—she was over at my place, and
she told me she didn’t know who had the other 500 shares.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Has anyone asked Earl about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I didn’t ask Earl about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about Jack himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you seen Jack since he has been in jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I have seen him three times since he has been in there—one time
I seen him—about 4 weeks ago—the time before I went to New York, the week
before I went to New York I was down there, the 27th, I think it was, and I
came back the 2d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was of April?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you saw him once just before that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was the first time you had seen him since he had been
in jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; I saw him twice when he first got into jail—twice I saw him
then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, there was the last time you saw him in jail
and then you saw him two other times before that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When were those times—about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I think about the second week and the fourth week—I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you discuss with him his business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir—no, sir; I didn’t discuss it—I didn’t discuss nothing—how
could you discuss a man’s business when he is held for murder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, I didn’t mean that you would bring up the subject,
but I was wondering if perhaps he had asked about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you have been unable to get from any source
Jack or Earl or Eva or Sam or anybody else where the other 500 shares are?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you gave your 500 you held to her—you received nothing
in return for it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No: what I told her to do was to pay the Government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And from all you know, she doesn’t even know where the other
500 shares are?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; that’s what she told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I noticed on your income tax return, too, that you had a capital
loss that you have spread over some years of $7,000; I think, last year was
about the last of it—I think you used about $1,000 a year; is that in connection
with any of this, or is that another transaction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; that’s from the Miramar and the ice cream place—that was in
1957. The place wasn’t in existence in 1957.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know a man by the name of George Senator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what you know about him, please, Mr. Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, he used to be a salesman, a dry goods salesman of men’s
apparel, let’s call it, shirts and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Wholesale?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; retail—maybe wholesale, I don’t know—he was working for
some firm on the road. Well, it’s Jack that made a friend of him you know
what I mean, coming up to the club. They got friendly and in the last year
I think he went into a novelty business with somebody—am I right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s the year 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I think so—some cars and little—different things, a lot of a little
truck, and then finally about—oh, maybe in July or <span class="locked">August——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; they pushed him out, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean his company did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. It isn’t a company, they pushed him out because he wasn’t selling
anything, or he was using up the money or something to that effect, and they
pushed him out and he wasn’t doing nothing and he was living with another man
and they had an apartment and the other man got married and he didn’t have
no money, so Jack told him he could live with him until he could get another
job, but that’s George Senator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you known George?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. About 2 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you think Ruby knew him about the same length of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I think so—maybe a little longer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he do any work around the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. George Senator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I think he used to help him out on Saturday night. I don’t know
whether he paid him or not. Now, I would like to know who told you I get
money out of the Carousel? I wish I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, I can’t answer that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I know, but somebody must have told you I get money out of that.
You know what I used to do—I used to count the money for him at the end
of the night because he was such a flip, you know what I mean, he used to argue
with everybody that would count the money for him, and hold it until he went
downstairs, so I gave it to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about that—that’s interesting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, if I be there on Saturday night or Friday night, at the end
of the night, he would say to me, “Clear the register.” So, I would count the
money. He says, “Let the boy from the bar give you the money and hold it
until we come downstairs and I go to the car.” And that’s how I got the money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you would be seen counting the money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes: that’s right—that’s why I wanted to know who told you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But that’s all it amounted to, just that you had counted the
money for him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s all—I would bring it downstairs—he never carried it
with him actually—I don’t know why he carried so much money the last time.
Actually, he used to throw it in the back of the car in the trunk and he said,
“That’s the place that nobody looks.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you have known him to go home with money in the
sack and he never put it on his person at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No—in the back of the car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Even when he parked his car at night he wouldn’t take it
upstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. What do you mean—no; he never took it up to the house—he
left it in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever have occasion to know how much money he had
around like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, of course, you know, I suppose, from the newspapers and
what you have heard that when he was arrested he had altogether on his person
and in the car an so forth, something in <span class="locked">excess——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. It was in the car too, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Some of it, yes; but to your knowledge, most of the time he
didn’t keep it on his person at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the gun, did he keep that on his person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. It’s a funny thing about the gun—he would always carry it in a
bag, in a deposit bag, a money bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A canvas bag, <span class="locked">and——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Unless he went some place special, because he always said somebody
might want to beat him up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you mean by “some place special”—like what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, like if he was going out on a date or something, you know,
I mean he wouldn’t carry the bag. I mean, if he went to a show or something,
he wouldn’t carry the bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But he took his gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; he left it in the bag. The only time he would carry the gun—the
bag was if he wasn’t going to no place or he went home—if he went to eat,
he would take it with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The gun or the bag?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. The bag with the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From his car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But yet he would leave it outside all night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. In the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But let me see if I get this straight—if he was going to eat, he
would go to his car, take the money out of the <span class="locked">trunk——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; the bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The bag—with the gun only?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. The gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He would leave the money there and take the bag with the gun,
and then carried the gun in that fashion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes, many times he would be driving my car, he would leave the
bag and the money on the bottom and lock the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the gun would be in there with the bag and the money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you say that there were occasions when he would take the
gun alone, leaving the money behind, but the gun not in a holster, but in a bag?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. But in a bag—so everybody thought he was carrying money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know if he ever owned a holster?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see him carry the gun in a pocket or tucked in his
waist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir; I never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The only time you have ever seen him carry his gun was when
he carried it in a bag?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. In the bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Gruber that lives out in
California?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Gruber?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Gruber [spelling] G-r-u-b-e-r.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That name doesn’t sound familiar to me. I’ll tell you, Jack had a
million friends that I would never remember their names anyway. He used
to introduce me and the name just flew by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about this boy Larry Crafard or Curtis Laverne Crafard,
as he was called—do you know anything about him, that young man that was
around the club for the last month or so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I think he was cleaning up the place every day and used to sleep
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever talk to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Jack brought up so many—no; I never did talk to him, but I never
talked to those people myself that Jack used to pick up in the street and bring
them up to work and do something, and in a couple of weeks they disappeared.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, it was not a peculiar thing at all for Jack to
bring in someone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Take them home to sleep—a man that hasn’t got a place to live.
I used to say to Jack, “Suppose he robs you?” He says, “So, he robs me.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Louis McWillie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. McWillie? I knew him a long time ago. I think he is in—not
Vegas—what is the other place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Vegas is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Vegas—is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell me what you know about him, was he ever in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; sure, he was in Dallas a long time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was his business when he was here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. When he come—he used to go to golf places and bet on golf.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are talking about golf tournaments and golf games?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As a matter of fact, wasn’t he a gambler in general—all sorts
of gambling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I think so—I never had any dealings with him either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know of Ruby’s dealings with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, do you know that sometime in 1959, probably around
September or Labor Day, Jack went down to Havana, Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And stayed with McWillie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, McWillie sent him the carfare—McWillie was running the
gambling house down there for the—I don’t know what it was—Batista or
some of their people—somebody else down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what you know and how you found out about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, Jack told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. He told me he sent him money to come down there for a vacation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was Jack supposed to work or was it just a vacation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Just a vacation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know of any reason why, or did Jack tell you any reason
why, McWillie would be interested in financing a vacation for Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I don’t know, but I think Jack was a close friend of his. Actually,
he thought the whole world was built around McWillie. Actually—and I
never could see it, and I never used to go out with him when McWillie was
around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You disliked McWillie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No: but I didn’t care too much for his personality.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever express yourself in that way to Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was his answer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, he told me—that he thinks he is a great guy—Jack says.
Well, actually, I for one never meet too many friends with Jack, and Jack made
everybody a friend and I haven’t got too many friends. I just work to make
a living. I’m not interested in a whole lot of other things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, what you are saying is that Jack was a man
who made a lot of friends?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were one of his friends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you had fewer friends than he did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you considered yourself one of his best friends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes—Jack’s best friend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Both ways?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember how long he stayed in Havana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. A week or 10 days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall whether he went to Miami at that time or New
Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I think he stopped in Miami and went from Miami to Cuba and he
came back to Miami. I think he had to do that anyway—it wasn’t a straight
flight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But I take it that you are assuming that it was not—what I
wanted to get at was whether Jack had ever told you—that’s the way you
would know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I’m telling you that he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That he told you that he went from here to Miami?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And from Miami down to Havana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And on the route back, he came back through Miami?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; I think that’s what he told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know of any other trips that he has taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. The only time when I was at the Vegas Club, he went to—what
are those Springs over there—Hot Springs—I think 2 weekends in a row.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know of any other travels that he might have made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. He went to New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Last year to see the AGVA president.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was in regard to the trouble he was having with the
Weinsteins?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think that was in August, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; it was earlier than August, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know of his trip to New Orleans last year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes—he went to—somebody told him about this strip down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Bourbon Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Bourbon Street and he went down to catch her act.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He went for what purpose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. To catch her act—to catch the girl’s act, so he could book her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He wanted to look at the girl’s act to see if he could get any
talent to come up here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. The reason why—she asked for a lot of money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Oh, what is her <span class="locked">name——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Jada?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Jada.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He went down to Bourbon Street to see if he could get any striptease
acts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That was the one he was sent to look at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was especially sent for Jada?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. This Earl Norman—the M.C.—was down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Earl Norman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; and he saw her and he asked Jack to go down and see and
get her, that she was going to bring him a lot of business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you knew this because Jack kept you in touch with the
things he was doing and he made a contract with Jada, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; she worked at the club quite a while.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She brought in some money, as I understand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; and no. At first she was doing all right, and then she fell
off to nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She quit, I think, before her contract was over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Actually, it was a verbal contract—the last. You see, they had
a contract to start with and then it became a verbal contract—she works as long
as she wants to—as long as he wants to keep her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, the first contract was a written contract but
of limited time, and when it ran out it was on a weekly basis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. On a weekly basis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. During last fall, say from the time Jack came back from New
York until November, do you think you saw him two or three times a week
then? Or spoke to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think you are in a position to say whether or not he left
town during any of those times during the period after he came back from New
York—say, September, October, and November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I don’t quite understand your answer—are you in a position
to say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. He didn’t leave town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In your opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. The only place I know he went is New Orleans and New York, last
year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And in your opinion if he had gone anyplace else, you would
have known it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I would have known it. In fact, I was the only one that knew
he went to New York, but when he went to New Orleans everybody knew because
that was another thing—that was no secret.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you are basing your opinion on the knowledge of his movements
by the fact that you were in contact with him both in person and by
telephone several times a week all through this period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Almost every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You would telephone one another?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You would telephone one another or see one another?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes—telephone mostly. In the last year, I think I used to go to
the club twice a week, Tuesday and Friday, because all the other nights I was
working.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, those were your nights off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you went almost 100 percent of the time that you had
nights off, Tuesday and Friday, you went to the Carousel and you would stay
there all evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, I wouldn’t come until late anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You would come late and stay until it closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. And then go for coffee or something to eat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And in other than those days you would get in touch by telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the purpose—just friendship?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s all—and, he had trouble with the Weinsteins and he always
asked for advice. That’s why he used to call me all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The telephone records, as you know, show quite a number of calls
between you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. They don’t?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They do, and I was wondering just what those calls were
about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, every day he would find something else he would like to do—he
would think of doing, or the union didn’t do right by him, the AGVA, or the
girls didn’t do right—that’s why he called me almost every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean he would call you if he had trouble with the girls?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. If he had trouble with any of the girls, he would call me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If he had trouble with the one—with the Weinsteins, he would
call you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; and the AGVA people—you see, they’ve got a board of directors
and each one takes a part, and if this one doesn’t do right—that was
almost consistently—he called on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you first hear that the President had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. On Friday—I was working. It was the lunch hour, you know,
and lunch hour is our busiest hour. I’m always there on the lunch hour,
and my landlord’s son called me on the telephone and told me the President
was shot—they got it on the radio, and so I turned on the radio and then we
all listened, everybody in the place naturally, because there was some excitement—people
hollered and cried all over the place, and then everybody was
listening to the radio to see what the result would be, and at 2 o’clock I went
home, or a little after 2—generally I stayed until 2 o’clock on Friday. A
little after 2—and when I got home Jack called me and he said, “Did you
hear what happened?” I said, “Yes; I heard it on the air.” He says, “Isn’t
that a terrible thing?” I said, “Yes; Jack.” He said, “I made up my mind.
I’m going to close it down.” I said, “Well, I can’t close down, I’ve got an eating
place.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And did he suggest to you that you should close down your
place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s what he said, “Ain’t you going to close?” I said, “No;
I’ve got an eating place.” I says, “You can do whatever you want.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he discuss with you whether he should close down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; he didn’t discuss it. He told me he was going to close down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you for how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Three days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was at 2 o’clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Friday at 2—Friday night and Saturday night and Sunday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was going to close up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Friday night and Saturday and Sunday nights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you why he had chosen those 3 nights?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; in honor of the President being shot—he was heartbroken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean, why 3 nights instead of 2 or 4?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s what I told him. I said to him, “Are the other clubs going
to close?” He said, “I don’t care about the other clubs.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was he calling you from, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I don’t know—he didn’t say where he was calling me from. He
generally called me from a telephone booth or the club—not so much from
his home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What would seem to be his condition when you were talking
to him, emotionally and otherwise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Very bad emotionally—he said, “I can’t believe it.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was it based upon, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I don’t know—if you don’t see the person, you can’t tell the
person on a telephone how he reacts <span class="locked">or——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean, you have known him for a good many years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Oh, yes; I’ve known Jack for so many years and he has always
been that way, you know, reaction—fast—punch line—got to do this right
away [indicating]. With him it wasn’t—he thought and did. It wasn’t a
second thought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you are quite clear that when he called you about 2
<span class="locked">o’clock——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s about a little after the time I got home—was a quarter
to 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that’s the first time you had heard from him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The President was already dead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was known he was dead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say anything about Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir; I didn’t know nothing about Tippit. I didn’t know
nothing about Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He didn’t tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; he didn’t tell me anything about Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, he said he had made up his mind he was going
to close up the club for 3 days already?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He didn’t ask you—he told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; he told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he mention he thought that the death of the President
would hurt business in the Dallas area and therefore hurt his business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He did not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did that conversation last—about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Three or 4 minutes—he says, “It’s a terrible, terrible thing.”
Then, when I got back to the place in the evening he called me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was about what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, I came back at 5 and I think he called me at 6.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know where he was then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir; he says, “It’s such a terrible thing that I’m going to go
to synagogue.” He says, “Do you want to come along?” I says, “No; I don’t
go to the synagogue, I’m not going to make a fool out of myself.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he go to the synagogue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he go often?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. For a year he went every—should I say—every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was after his father’s death?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That was after his father died—yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s part of the Jewish religion that you should do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; that’s true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he followed that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. He followed that very closely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After that, did he go very much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; once in a while on holidays—he made it a habit of going on
holidays to the synagogue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s the Jewish holidays?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But he didn’t go every week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No—no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it a surprise to you that he would be going to the synagogue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. To tell you the truth, I didn’t—anything Jack does is no surprise
to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I’m sorry (addressing the reporter) I didn’t get that, did you
get that?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Reporter</span>. “To tell you the truth, anything Jack does is no surprise to
me.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But it was not his normal custom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; but he says he’s going to pray because a thing like that
happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, that, you think, was about what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. About 6 o’clock in the evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that conversation was just a matter of a few minutes, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you hear from him next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I don’t know whether it was that night again, after he got out of
synagogue—I can’t recall. But, he didn’t call me again—I know—until Saturday
night, or until Saturday afternoon, and he said, “Did you see my ad in the paper?”
I says, “What paper?” Well, Saturday is a pretty bad paper, and I said, “What
paper?” He says, “In the Times Herald and the News.” I said, “What did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
you put?” He said, “That I’m closing down for 3 days.” I said, “That’s what
you said to me yesterday.” He said, “But, it’s in the paper.” I said, “All right,
I believe you.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You think that was Saturday afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had not spoken to him or seen him since the night before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No—I didn’t see him—no; when I saw him was Thursday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were at the club then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; then he called me Saturday when I got home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, I didn’t feel too good that night, and I left home—I generally
work until 1 o’clock in the morning. I left at 11 o’clock and he said he called
the place and they told him I went home and they told him I didn’t feel well,
and he says, “What’s wrong with you?” And I says, “I’ve got a cold,” and
then he told me that he was downtown and that nobody was doing any business,
so I says to him, “Well, if nobody is doing any business, I guess you had better
close.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what did he say to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Then he called me back one more time—I didn’t give you this before
because I didn’t—then he called me back one more time and told me that he
was over at his sister’s house, Eva’s house, and Eva was crying and they are
both crying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This was Saturday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. This was Saturday night—that was late. I said, “Jack, I don’t
feel good. Let me go to sleep.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long after the first call on Saturday night did the second
call come?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. The first call come, I think, was 9:30 or 10 o’clock, and the second
call I think was about 11:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had left at what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I left the place about 9 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Because of your feeling ill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he reached you shortly after you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, it was about an hour or so later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were in bed already?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I was in bed already—that was the last time I spoke to him, I says,
“Jack, let me go to sleep because I don’t feel well.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was on the second call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, the second call was at what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. About 11 or 11:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The first call was about 9:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; about 10:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About 10:30, and the second call about an hour after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; I left the place, but it just takes me about 15 or 20 minutes
to get home, and I doctored myself up with some hot tea and so forth—it must
have taken about another half hour, so it must have been about 10:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, on the first call—he had called your place and
found out you were not feeling well?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; he called me and I told him I wasn’t feeling well and he
told me that nobody downtown was doing any business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then you told him he ought to be glad he stopped, because
if nobody was doing any business he might as well be closed, and that was about
the subject of that conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s—that was that conversation. That’s the subject, and then
he called me back and he told me he was over at his sister’s house and his sister
was crying and he was crying with her on account of the President, and that’s
the last I spoke to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You could hear her crying or he told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. He just told me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about his own crying, could you tell that he was crying,
did he seem to be crying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; he wasn’t crying then when he spoke to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He wasn’t crying then—in other words, what he was telling you
was that he and his sister had been crying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Had been crying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that all he wanted to tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you in effect told him you were sick and not to bother you
any more, would that be about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. And I went to sleep and that’s the last I talked to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, when was your next contact with Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. When he was in jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you hear about the Oswald matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Sunday morning—I was—I had just finished making out the payroll.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the Bull Pen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; when John Jackson, my manager, called and the girl answered
the phone and she says—he says, “Oswald is shot.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He said that to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. To the girl, and the girl relayed it to me. Just, “Oswald was shot,”
so I looked up and I says, “So what?” I mean—just the regular coincidence.
“So what?” 5 minutes later a fellow that lived around the corner that knew
me—he used to work at the Sky Club years ago, named Howard something, came
in and says, “Jack Ruby shot Oswald.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was in the Bull Pen at Arlington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was that man’s name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Howard something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s his first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Howard is his first name—I can’t think of the second name—he’s
just a customer there—he used to work a long time ago at the Sky Club—I think
he was—he used to be their cabinet man there, so I says, “Go away.” I says,
“Wait, I’ll call the house.” So, I called the house and nobody answered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You called Jack’s house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; I called Jack’s house and nobody answered, so Jackson and his
wife came in and said, “Yes, we just saw it on TV that Jack Ruby shot Oswald.”
So, I says, “All right”—that’s when I called Tom Howard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what time was it you called Howard, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I would say it was about in between 11:30 and 12 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, between 10 minutes or 15 minutes after the shooting,
to 30 to 40 minutes after the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, you know—shooting—we didn’t think he killed him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. So, I says, “Tom,” well Tom has been my lawyer for the longest
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He has been your lawyer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; and Jack’s too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Jack’s too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; and I says, “Tom, see what you could do for Jack. I heard
he shot Oswald.” He says, “Okay,” and that’s it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he indicate to you that he was not aware that Oswald had
been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I don’t know whether he did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he indicate to you when you talked to him that he was not
aware that Ruby had shot him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; I just told him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he seem to be surprised?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say anything to indicate he knew about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; he didn’t. He says, “Okay, I’ll take care of it.” Those are
the words he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you asked him to see what he could do and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
without indicating whether he knew about it or not, as far as you could tell,
he says, “I’ll see what I can do.” And that was the end of the conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you make any appointment to meet him yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Who—Tom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; I went down to his office anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you were at the Bull Pen at that conversation and you went
where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Downtown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I went to the—John and I and the girl went down to the police
station and I saw Tom Howard there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Inside the station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whereabouts was it, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. It was right off the entrance to the—as you walk in—do you
know where the entrance is when you walk in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From Harwood Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On Harwood Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; it’s on Commerce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Not the basement ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. The basement ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You went through the basement ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time was that, about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Maybe 1 o’clock, and so we meet him, and he says, “They won’t
let you see him anyway, you had better go over and stay at the office. I think
it’s on television.” So we walked over to his office and we watched television
until about 3 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was Jackson and you and Howard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; not Howard—a girl Tammi True.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tammi True and you went to Howard’s office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And Howard was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; I was in the courthouse—he sent us over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Howard sent you to his office to watch television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; to watch television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he went where, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what he did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; he—some more lawyers they all got together and then they
left again and they came back again and riding into town, that’s when we
heard that Oswald was dead—died.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you got to Howard’s office, you knew he had died?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Howard tell you he had tried to get a writ of habeas corpus
for Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what happened to that proceeding, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you stayed there, you said, until about when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. 3 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is Tammi True?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s one of the girls that worked at the club before—she was an
entertainer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was she at the Bull Pen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; she lives in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did she come to be riding with you and Jackson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. She came up to the Bull Pen when she heard about Jack Ruby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you drive in her car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; in Jackson’s car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, when she heard it at her home in Fort Worth,
she came to your place and the three of you came downtown and stayed until
3 o’clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I went back—went back home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The three of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; I went as far as—we took Tammi back and then I let Jackson
off and I went back to Dallas and went to the movies.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You took Tammi back to Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then came back to Arlington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And left off Jackson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; and I went back to the movies, because when I came in, I
says, “Anybody looking for me,” to the cashier, and she says, “A reporter and
a photographer was calling you.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was at the Bull Pen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you drove in your car alone and you went to the movies and
I think you said you went to the Majestic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you get there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I got there about 4:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you park your car some place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I parked it on the lot. You see, Sunday, you don’t have to have
no parking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you stayed in the Majestic and watched the show?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I stayed there about an hour—I wasn’t interested too much in
the show, I just wanted to get away from everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you come out of the show?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. It must have been about, oh, 6 something—I went back and I went
to Jackson’s house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You went into the show about what time—4:30, you think?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you stayed there until about 6, when you came out, about
an hour and a half?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I went back and went over to Jackson’s house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s on what street and where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s where I’m living now—Browning Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you went to his house—go ahead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; and stayed there about an hour or so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was there with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. The girls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What girls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Jackson’s girls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean his daughters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; two girls; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was just the three of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; they made me something to eat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you got there about what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Then, I called the place and Jackson told me that the FBI was
looking for me and I kept on wondering what they wanted with me, and so we
stayed over there, and then his sister had had a little gathering over at her
house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean Eva?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; Jackson’s sister, so we went over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Her name is Mrs. Gable?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; we had some ice cream and John walked in with the two FBI
men; that was 9 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Mrs. Bowman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Mrs. Bowman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. She’s my ex-partner’s wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you living with her at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. We were living together in a big house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On that date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; that’s way out in the country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see her that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Not at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I don’t think I did—I might have seen her when I left the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what time would that have been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Oh, in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you didn’t see her after Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I don’t think so—I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go back to the house after Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I think I went from the movies to the house and changed clothes—that’s
what I think I did, and then went over to Jackson’s house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was it that you decided to take over the operation of the
club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That Monday after the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack ask you to do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir; I didn’t see Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Eva ask you to do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, why did you do it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Personally, I don’t know—I just did it on the spur of the moment,
and I have been sorry every day after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ask Jack, or send word to him that you were going to
do this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ask—well, weren’t you interested in salvaging some of
the debt that was owed to you if you could?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. If I could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s what I meant—that was why you did it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; but I saw what I was getting into—it turned out to be a
lemon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, it turned out, as you say, to be a lemon, but your motive
was to see if you could operate it to see if anything could be made out of it, to
see if you could recover some of the debt that was owed to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And at the same time, I suppose, if you could make the thing
a success—whatever Jack’s interest was, it would be helpful to him, too?</p>

<p>Is that a fair statement of what was running in your mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, naturally—I <span class="locked">mean——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t want to put words in your mouth—if it’s not so, tell me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Actually, it was on the spur of the moment that I did it, and I
learned right away it cost me money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Eva object?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did any of his brothers or sisters object?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you actually operated it for approximately 2½ months?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then why did you close it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, maybe I would still be operating it—no, I wasn’t going to
operate it any more. I told Eva, “I’m going to give you the stock,” and let her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
do whatever she wanted to with it, because I couldn’t do it any more. The
second thing is, I had a broken foot—I couldn’t make it any more over there.
I was only coming up once a week, and the thing was shot, and then on the same
day I decided to that, the liquor control board closed it up. They didn’t close
it up, they sent me a notice that I can’t sell beer, so I might as well close it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it hasn’t been opened since then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You paid the rent and all the bills during that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. When I was operating it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you came out a deficit of about $3,000?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. At least—maybe more—I paid the Government $1,770.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was that for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Back taxes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Excise taxes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; it was for September, November, October, December.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that excise tax?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Excise tax—that’s the cabaret tax, they call it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It doesn’t have anything to do with the social security or withholding
taxes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I paid them some of that too—there was only one person that was
getting paid—all the entertainers got their own—they don’t go under social
security.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They are self-employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a woman by the name of Bertha Cheek?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. What is her name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Bertha Cheek.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. It doesn’t even ring a bell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Ruby ever tell you that just towards the end, in a week or
two prior to the death of Oswald, that he was trying to borrow some money
from her, and get her interested in opening a new cabaret?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or doing something to the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir; that name don’t even ring a bell to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know her at all and he never mentioned her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nor did he mention that he was trying to raise any money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think perhaps you would be in as good a position as anybody
else to tell us some things about Jack’s personal life. As you may know, there
have been some rumors at least, that maybe Jack was a homosexual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Oh, no—there was rumors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, you have heard the rumors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We would like your opinion on that subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Oh, no—no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You knew the man a long time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. A long time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is your opinion he was not a homosexual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Positively.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was his relationship with women generally; do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, he liked women.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have affairs with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes—just different times, different women all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he ever particularly attached to one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Let me remember that name again—mention some names, I can’t
think of the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Alice Nichols?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Alice Nichols—yes, I think they were going around together for
about 10 or 11 years. I used to go out with them too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was his relationship to the girls who used to work in his
place, was it strictly a business relationship?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. With the girls—strictly business. He would like to make a girl that
would come up there, but not the girls that was working for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean he wouldn’t try to date the strippers or waitresses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No—we used to take them out for coffee after they got through, but
that’s all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I would like to show you a picture, or rather several pictures
which have already been identified, and I’m not going to give them a new
identification number. I’m going to show you a group of five pictures, exact
copies of which have already been identified in connection with the deposition
of Andrew Armstrong, as Exhibits 5300 A through F and ask you if it is not
so that Jack Ruby appears in each one of those pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, there are two girls in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. One has blonde hair and is wearing dark clothes and the other
is—has darker hair and is wearing a striped dress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you tell us who they are, referring first to the one with the
blonde hair with the black dress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes, that’s Kathy Kay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is the other one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. This is Alice—somebody—I don’t know the second name anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Alice Anderson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes—I never knew her second name. She worked there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did she work there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Alice was a waitress or a champagne girl, what you call them,
and she was the strip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, Kathy Kay was a strip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Kathy Kay was a strip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long had the girl that you identify as Alice, to wit, the
girl in those pictures with the striped dress, how long had she been working at
the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, from the time he made a burlesque out of it, she used to work
a couple of weeks, a couple of months, then quit and come back and work another
couple of months or couple of weeks and then quit. She was never a steady girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is she married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he date her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, are you positive or is it that you just don’t know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But I take it from the way you answered the question that you
knew him so well that you probably would have known it if he had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes—if he did I would have known.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He would tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He told you about his affairs with women, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; not always—he told me about affairs he wanted to tell me
about, let’s put it that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there lots of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, there were quite a few.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know of a girl by the name of Joyce McDonald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Joyce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think her stage name was Joy Dale?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recognize her in the photo I am now showing you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Oh, I recognize her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This photograph has been identified in connection with the deposition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
of Andrew Armstrong, as Exhibit 5301 A through E, and there are five
pictures here showing a man and two girls—Jack Ruby is the man, of course;
is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the girl on your right, as you look at the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I’m not seeing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I would like for you to identify both girls, but do so in such a
way that the record can show it—in other words, when you say, “this” it won’t
show up on the record, but when you say “this” you must say the girl on the
left-hand side of the picture as you are looking at it—is that who you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; that’s Dale.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s the girl called Joyce Day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Joy Dale.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s the one on the right-hand side of the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; the one on the right-hand side is—what do you call her again—that
little girl up that went to court?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Little Lynn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Little Lynn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s Karen Bennett, did you know her as that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; I never knew her as that, all I knew her was Little Lynn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what the relationship between this Dale girl and
Jack Ruby was that you have identified in Exhibit 5301 A through E, the deposition
of Andrew Armstrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I don’t know what Andrew knew, but I know nothing about her.
I know she worked there—she was a stripper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So far as you know, was there any romantic relationship or sex
relationship?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I don’t know. I wouldn’t say “yes” and I wouldn’t say “no.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You just don’t know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Anything I don’t know—I can’t say I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s absolutely correct. I am simply asking you because you
have been a friend a long time and as you said a moment ago, he told you some
of the things that he wanted you to know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well; I don’t think he wanted me to know about any of the girls
that worked in the club, even if he did have affairs with them—that would be—I
probably would say something to him, but on the outside, I know a lot of
girls that he had affairs with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I’m now going to show you a picture which has been identified as
one of the pictures in Exhibit 5303 A through M deposition on Andrew Armstrong,
a picture which shows a girl in a bikini suit, a blond girl. There seems to be
two sailors in the picture and on the right-hand side of the picture as you look
at it, there is a rather large man in a white shirt with his left elbow leaning on
the stage, and I ask you if you know who the girl is, do you recognize her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s the same Kathy Kay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s Kathy Kay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is the man, the fat man, that I have referred to with the
white shirt, the very heavy man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. This one over here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see him there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No—there isn’t a familiar face in there. What is he supposed to
be? No answers [laughing].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I will show you now two pictures that have been previously
identified as Exhibit 5304 A and B in connection with the deposition of Andrew
Armstrong, the first one showing a girl serving a man who is seated,
and there is apparently a boy in the background, and I ask you if you can
identify that place, first of all, is that the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recognize the place at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know who the girl is who is in the stripper suit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know who the man is, sitting down at the table?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know who that bartender is standing at the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Mickey Ryan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No—I might have heard the name but I never knew a guy with
a name like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t recognize the man at the bar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No—it’s not in the Carousel, that’s for sure. The Carousel had
no cloths on the tables.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nor did it have a bar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. It had a bar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean, not for liquor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No; that’s right—that looks like a private club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you familiar with the notebooks and memo books that
Ruby kept?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see them at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think that one of the girls in the club had a boy friend named
Tommy, do you know who that was—Tommy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. The only real boy friends that I can give you the name of and she
got married to the boy recently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. He was in the police department, but I can’t think of his name.
He made her give up the business and they got married and went to California,
but you know, talking about boy friends, those girls have boy friends all the
time—they are different boy friends—you never know which one is which. I
can’t remember one name from another.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, here’s what I wanted to get at—after you took over the
club, you apparently hired someone to collect the cover charge at the front?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was a gray-haired man, I’m told?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, it was Leo Torti.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. [Spelling] T-o-r-t-i?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t have a gray-haired man there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you get him, had he been there before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He had worked there before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, he didn’t actually work, he used to help Eva, and when Eva
closed that place down he came to help there, but he never got paid for anything—just,
I took him home and I took him out for a bite to eat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old a man would he have been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Forty or forty something—he isn’t gray. I’m the only gray man
that was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There was no gray man who was on the door collecting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Eva close up the Vegas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes, she closed it up and then she sold it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When—before the Carousel was closed up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Oh, yes, she closed it up right after New Year’s.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Right after Ruby was put in jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, right after New Year’s.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean she sold it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. She sold it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whom did she sell it to?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. She sold it to two men and a woman that formed a corporation
and bought it. It’s still called the Vegas Club—they’ve got it in the paper
“under new management—Vegas Club.” I don’t even know who they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I handed you at the beginning of the deposition, or even
before the deposition began, a number of sheets of paper, the first group numbering
nine pages, purporting to be a report of an interview of you by the
FBI agents Lish [spelling] L-i-s-h and Barratt [spelling] B-a-r-r-a-t-t, relating
to an interview with you on November 24, 1963, running, as I said, for nine
pages.</p>

<p>For the purpose of identification, I am marking the first page as follows:
“Dallas, Texas, April 15, 1964, Exhibit 5319, Deposition of Ralph Paul,” and
I am putting my name on the first page, and also writing my initials on the
lower right-hand corner of every one of the other pages.</p>

<p>Now, I ask you if you have had an opportunity to read that document, now
identified as Exhibit 5319?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. What do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you had a chance to read it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does it represent the truth as far as you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. As far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are there any corrections you want to make or errors you want
to correct in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, you asked me the same <span class="locked">thing——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By referring specifically to Exhibit 5319, you see, is there anything
in Exhibit 5319 that is not the truth as far as you know, in this document
here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, that’s why I asked you to read it, so you could tell me
whether there is anything you want to change in there and you may take your
time with it—I don’t want to rush you at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. This page alone, or the whole thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The whole thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I don’t know what I could change.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you read it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I think I did—in what respect are you asking me that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I just want to know if everything in there is correct, and to
give you the opportunity of changing anything in there that is not correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, I told you the same thing that you asked me—that’s all here—I
can’t change it in any way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you can if it is not the truth, because all we want is
the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s what I told you—the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, are you willing to state, then, that the facts related, the
statements made in the documents, consisting of nine pages which I have now
identified as Exhibit 5319, are correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. As far as I can recall they are correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have anything to add that document that you think of
right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. As far as I could tell, when they asked me those questions, I told
them that was that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And this seems to be a true and fair report of the interview with
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anything you want to delete from that because it is
wrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. How is it wrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, if it is not wrong, I would take it you would not want
to delete it. That’s what I’m trying to do—is to ask you if there is anything
in there that’s incorrect, because what we are seeking to get is the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. You think this is wrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No, sir; I didn’t suggest it was wrong. I want to ask you—since
you have had an opportunity to read it——<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Everything I told them at the time was the right thing—I told
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that seems to be a fair and honest report of the interview
you had with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, that’s all I wanted to know about that.</p>

<p>Now, there is another document which purports to be an interview with you
by FBI Agent Clements.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. On the telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On November 28, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes, over the telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which I am marking for purposes of identification as follows:
“Dallas, Texas, April 15, 1964, Exhibit 5320, Deposition of Ralph Paul,” and I
am signing my name on that document. That document contains only one page
and it <span class="locked">refers——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. To the stock deal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To some stock deal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Let me see it just a minute.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This document relates to some conversation with Special Agent
Clements, which was had with you, and it is a report of it. Now, will you tell
me—I think that that conversation was over the phone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t believe the document so indicates, but if that is one
thing we have learned from this is that that was over the phone—does it
fairly state the content of the conversation you had with the agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Yes; he asked me what was my interest in the club and I told
him I got a certificate of 50 shares, which I received from Jack Ruby because
he wanted to protect the money I loaned him, that if anything goes wrong—well,
he didn’t put it in so many words—he put it in a different—collateral—you
know what that means—and he said, “Is that what you mean?” And I said, “I
guess that’s what it is supposed to be.”</p>

<p>I told him that Jack Ruby and Slayton formed the Sovereign Club and it
was called the S. and R., Incorporated. I never knew anything about the
Sovereign Club, Incorporated, that it was then terminated and became the
Carousel Club, which he gave it a name.</p>

<p>Now, I don’t know whether the Carousel Club was incorporated, and I said,
“I think it is Earl, Ruby’s brother, that had the 500 other shares,” but I didn’t
know for sure, that’s what I told him. He said he believes Earl, Ruby’s brother.
I was confused with the question of whether I owned stock or not, which I was.
I thought it was merely—he gives me the stock because, like I told you, when
he wanted to sell the place he asked me for the stock so he could sell the place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, at the time you spoke to him, in fact you were confused as
to what the situation was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I sure was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I’m asking you, is—is this a fair statement of what you
told him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I think I gave him a fair statement right up to the minute—not that
statement—that statement isn’t up to the minute, but up to the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But at the time—it was accurate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. At the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever been interviewed by any member of the President’s
Commission before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Mr. Paul, one final thing—we have the two statements that
you have given to the FBI, and you have what you have told us tonight—do you
think that putting those two things together we have just about all you know
about Jack Ruby and about what he had to do with the slaying of Oswald and
so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I don’t know nothing about the slaying of Oswald—that’s for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand that, but we know all you know about it when we
have what you told us tonight and this statement—there’s nothing else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I just told you all I know about Jack Ruby for 15 years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There’s nothing we don’t know that you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that a fair statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. If I knew any more I would be willing to tell you, because you
didn’t pull the words out of my mouth either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; that’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. I spoke to you as I knew it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you anything else to add?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. No—really, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, thank you, sir. I appreciate your coming in and I am sorry
it took so long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. Well, that’s perfectly all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you very much for coming in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>. All right, thank you.</p>

<h2 id="SENATOR">TESTIMONY OF GEORGE SENATOR</h2>
</div>

<p>The testimony of George Senator was taken at 9:45 a.m., on April 21, 1964, at
200 Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C., by Messrs. Burt W. Griffin and
Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President’s Commission. Dr. Alfred
Goldberg, historian, was present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of George Senator beginning at 9:45 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. Senator, my name is Leon Hubert and this is Mr. Burt Griffin. We are
both members of the advisory staff of the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Under the provisions of Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, the
Joint Resolution of Congress, No. 137, and the rules of procedure adopted by the
Commission in conformance with the Executive order and the joint resolution,
we have both been authorized to take a sworn deposition from you, Mr. Senator.</p>

<p>I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is to
ascertain, evaluate and report upon the facts relating to the assassination of
President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>In particular as to you, Mr. Senator, the nature of the inquiry today is to
determine what facts you know about the death of Oswald and any other
pertinent facts you may know about the general inquiry, and about Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Senator, I think you have appeared today by virtue of written request
made to you by Mr. J. Lee Rankin, general counsel of the staff of the President’s
Commission. Is that a fact, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you receive that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the date of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. April 16, 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you receive it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I received it Saturday. I don’t know what date it was. What
was the date Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Saturday would have been the 18th.</p>

<p>Now, under the rules adopted by the Commission, you are entitled to a 3-day
written notice prior to the taking of the deposition, but the rules adopted by the
Commission also provide that a witness may waive this notice, and I ask you
now whether you do waive the notice in the event that you did not get the
full 3 days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. We will continue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand by your answer that you say that you do waive it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I waive it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, Mr. Senator. Will you rise now and take the oath?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give in this matter
will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now will you state your full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. George Senator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that your permanent residence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I mean I just come up, you know, I just came to New York
about 2½ weeks ago and am staying with my sister temporarily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you propose to go to another place, to move to another place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Eventually I will, yes; in New York, but momentarily I do not
know where.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you are staying at your sister’s home temporarily?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Temporarily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But your purpose is to live in New York?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you will, when you find an apartment, some other place to
live, move out from your sister’s house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I wonder if you would go over briefly in your own words the
facts of your life, particularly where you lived, and your occupation, beginning
actually with your education.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. My education was up to the eighth grade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Gloversville, N.Y.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then after you finished the eighth grade, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I moved to New York and went to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean New York City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; New York City. I lived with my sister, too. I mean I
moved in with my sister at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the same sister you are now living with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is her name, by the way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Freda Weisberg, Mrs. A. J. Weisberg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you live with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Originally, let me say approximately about 3 years. I went back
and forth actually from New York back to home. Of course, I was only in my
teens then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What sort of work did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In New York I was working in a silk house, I was working for
a wholesaler where we delivered silk to the dress manufacturer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you continued in that <span class="locked">occupation——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Just in my young teens.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Until you were how old?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Possibly about 18, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were living with your sister as you said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, at age 18, did your life take a change by way of occupation
and residence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, I got sick a couple of times so every time I got sick I went
home to mother. I went back home. Of course, the distance, was about 190
miles from my home town to New York City. At one time I had pleurisy, went
back home and stayed a year. Another time I had peritonitis. I went back home
again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This was after age 18 or before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; this is now after 18.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then I take it that after age 18 and for a period of 1 or 2 years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
you were not working because of illness and you were staying mostly with your
mother at home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; well, my brother had a restaurant, or rather, still does.
He has a restaurant. I used to help him up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where? What place was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Gloversville, N.Y. He had a restaurant by his name, by his
last name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you work with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. On and off, this is a rough guess, it has been so many years. I
would probably say maybe a couple of years, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At which time you lived with your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, I lived home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would that take us then in your life to about age 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say around there, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then what happened after those days of your life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Then I went back. I can’t quote you the exact years, but I
went back to New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. City, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. New York City, and I went to work for a—I was jerking sodas in
the early thirties. That is when I was in my twenties yet then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you live during that period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I was still home with my sister. I went back. I shuttled
either from my sister to my mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not have any residence of your own?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did she live during that period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. My sister? She lived in the Bronx, still does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean the same address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the address, or were there several? I am
talking now about this other period, you see, that is to say when <span class="locked">you——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I can think of the streets but I probably could not think of
the numbers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, that is all right. Give us the streets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. All right. When I originally came to New York it was on
Davidson Avenue in the Bronx.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would have been when you were about 12 years old?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no. I first came to New York when I was 15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did she live then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. On Davidson Avenue in the Bronx. Then from Davidson I
think I moved to Walton Avenue. These are all close by, these streets, you
know. I would probably say a distance of maybe 4, 5, or 6 blocks, something
of that nature. Then I lived there—I am trying to think now. I have to jump
back a lot of years and can’t think of these outright.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We understand that and we understand therefore that your
answers must be approximations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, they are approximations. When I got this job jerking
sodas there, now I’m in my twenties already. Of course, this is in the 1930
years. I was approximately around 25 when I was working in the Bronx
jerking sodas and still living with my sister.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was around 1938, I take it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, and 1939; 1938 and 1939.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the place at which you worked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, sure, J. S. Krums, chocolatiers. That is on the Grand
Concourse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would probably say I may have been there around 2 years.
Now this is roughly guessing. Then the place went out on strike and I went out
of a job. Then from there, two other fellows who were employed with us,
we all went down to Florida. We went down to Florida for the winter and
got a job there for $14 a week and stayed all winter, then we come back again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of work were you doing and who was your employer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I couldn’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or employers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I couldn’t remember. It was a cafeteria with a soda fountain
and I worked at the soda fountain. It has been so many, many years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who were the other two people that you went with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. One fellow, his name was Ike Heilberun, and the other is—I
can’t remember his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you seen either of those two people in the last 10 or 20 years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say—no, one I haven’t seen in many, many years. As a
matter of fact, I think even before the war.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which one, the one whose name you don’t remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the other one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The other I think the last time I saw him must have been maybe
around 6 years or 7 years ago. He is down in Florida.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of work is he doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He is in the stationery business, if he still is, I mean. He was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you met him in connection with work or socially or how, that
is 6 years ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, no; it happened to be I went down there. I went down
there for a vacation there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you looked him up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. And I looked him up and I found him and when I found him he
was in the stationery end.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How extended was your visit with him then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, just casual. I would probably say maybe I saw him two or
three times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No business relations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no; no business relations whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s go back now and pick up the time when you came back from
Florida. I say “came back.” I assume you went back to New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I went back to New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And tell us <span class="locked">again——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I do not remember if I stayed in New York or went back home
now, because I would say on and off I had worked for my brother at various
times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Jake Senator. Senator’s Restaurant in Gloversville, N.Y. I
worked on and off at his place many times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How far have you progressed in your own mind as to this chronicle
of your life? We are up to what year now that you were working for your
brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. At the time I enlisted. In other words, when the war broke out
I enlisted down at Albany, N.Y., at the Federal Building in Albany, N.Y. That
was in August of 1941, I believe. I think it was August 20 or August 21, 1941,
and I was with my brother at the time when I enlisted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember working for the Admiral Hotel in Miami Beach
and the Times Square Cafeteria?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; that is it. That is the place, the Times Square Cafeteria.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And David and Elizabeth Rosner at the Astor Hotel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It could be possible. I just don’t remember. It could be possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you were in Miami and worked for several people
whose names I have mentioned during the winter of 1939–40 and until about the
end of the season in Miami Beach, I take it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you enlist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I enlisted August 20 or 21 of 1941.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was before Pearl Harbor then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall what you did or where you lived from the summer
of 1940?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall what occupation you had or where you lived from
the summer of 1940 when you returned from Miami to New York until you entered
into the service in August of 1941?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I believe I was back home with my brother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is working for him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The restaurant, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you stay in the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I’ll have to read it, or I’ll let you read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No: that is all right. You served for the duration of the war, I
suppose? You hand me now a little document which is a laminated copy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The reason I handed you that is because I lost my original and
I am happy that I have got that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were honorably discharged from the Army of the United
States on September 9, 1945, given to you at the Separation Center, Fort Dix,
N.J? This reflects also that you were a staff sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That your serial number was 12006042, and that at the time of
your discharge you were with the 101st Bomber Fortress Squadron?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; when I came out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Then after you left the service in September of 1945,
where did you go and what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. When I came back out of the service, this fellow Ike Heilberun,
who I mentioned living down there, we went into the luncheonette business and
lasted approximately about a year and lost our shirts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the name of that? Is that the outfit called the
Denise Foods, Inc.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Where is that located? Do you have the location on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 254 West 35th Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I couldn’t remember the name. I remember the street. That
is why I asked you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, that was a corporation formed by you and this
man you talked about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. We bought somebody out, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were occupied with that endeavor through most of
1946?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say approximately about that to the best of my
knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And where did you live then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I was living—of course, I can’t remember if I got married
before that or after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But sometime along in there after you left the service, you
got married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. I believe I got married in January 1946, if I am not mistaken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the name of the lady you married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Sherley Baren.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you spell that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. B-a-r-e-n.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you still married to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you divorced?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When? Approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Approximately about 7 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Approximately, I’m not sure of the date. I’d say approximately
about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you lived together as man and wife approximately
for 10 years?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Seven years ago would be 1957. You said that you married her
in January of 1946. Maybe you did not live together that long. Maybe the
divorce came after you had physically separated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. Actually, we had been separated I would probably say
around 3 years, I think. I think it must have been around 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before the divorce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. I think that is it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any children of that marriage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. I have one son 16 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He is now 16 years old?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Bobby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were you divorced?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Through the mail. She was in Miami and I was in Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But where were the divorce proceedings actually instituted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In Miami.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She brought the divorce suit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Has she remarried?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know to whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. His name is Milton Wechsler. I am not sure of the spelling
of it. I think it is W-e-c-h-s-l-e-r. I think that is how you spell it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know where they live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Coral Gables.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now would you tell us of your occupation and residences
after your marriage, say from January 1946 forward?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. After I went out of business, after my partner and I went out
of business, I moved down to Miami and I had two or three odd jobs there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. At these jobs, do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Or Miami?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I stayed in Miami, I would say, around 7 or 8 years. As a
rough guess, something like that, offhand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had a number of jobs during the first year that you got
there; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of work did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Restaurant-type work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I notice that your social security records indicate that you
either had no earnings or at least that none were reported for the second half
of 1947 and the first half of 1948, approximately a year. Can you explain that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. 1947 and 1948?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, for the third and fourth quarters from a social
security point of view of 1947 and the first and second <span class="locked">quarters——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Of 1948?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of 1948, so it would be roughly from July 1947 to June of 1948
there were no earnings reported.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. 1947 and 1948?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After which—this may assist your memory—for the third
quarter of 1948, that is say from July on, you report having worked at the Lake
Carrolton Club Grill in Pike. N.H.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, perhaps if you remember working in New Hampshire, you
can back off and tell us what happened in that year when there were no earnings
reported. This may assist you too. The social security records show that in
the first quarter of 1947, that would have been January, February, and March,
you apparently worked for the T-A Hensroost.</p>

Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I believe that was the first job I had when I got down in Miami,
if I am not mistaken. I think that was the first job I got. That was an open
stand on the oceanfront.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember that you worked there actually for the first
6 months?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. At the Hensroost?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of 1947.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. At Hensroost? I can’t quote how long I worked there, but I know
that I worked there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now then, perhaps we can reconstruct the thing, because you
apparently left there at the Hensroost in midsummer of 1947, and then you pick
up in midsummer of 1948 in New Hampshire, and it is the intervening year
that I would like to have you cover.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Wait a minute. Oh, then I think after that, yes, I was out of
a job for a while and I don’t recall how long. Then I got a job in another little
luncheonette for a while and I don’t know how long that was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It may be that you did not have enough earnings to require reporting
them, you see. What I am trying to do is assist your memory. Do you
recall leaving Miami Beach to go to New Hampshire?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, sure; I remember going. I don’t remember what year, but
I remember going, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember what time of the year, whatever year it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I went there for one summer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. For the season?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The season; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your wife went with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She stayed in Miami?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you finished the season there, what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, I come back and I was—I’m trying to think. What year
was that, 1940-what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was the last half of 1948. Perhaps I can assist your memory
too by pointing out that your social security records indicate that you worked
for T-A Troops.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, that is the place I was trying to mention to you but I
couldn’t think of it. Now I don’t remember if I worked for that place after I
come back or before. That is the thing I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You worked for that place quite a length of time, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long? Do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Gee, I don’t remember how long I worked there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you live when you were working for Troops?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Northwest Fourth Terrace.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Miami Beach?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; Miami.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, the restaurant was in Miami Beach?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On Collins Avenue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is right; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You lived in Miami City itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you living with your wife then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall what your next move was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I believe my next move is I got a job selling. I was broken in
selling women’s apparel, if I recall right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Women’s apparel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before we leave the Miami Beach situation, what was the cause
of your leaving Miami Beach and the Miami area, because apparently you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You mean when I went to Texas?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No, when you left Miami you did not go directly to Texas, did
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Sure. Come this May 15, and I think I am pretty well on the
date, I have been in Texas 10 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you moved to Texas in 1954?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. May of 1954.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember working for the Rhea Manufacturing Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; out of Milwaukee, Wis. That was my start. Is that in the
year of 1950, something like that? I don’t remember, 1949, 1948?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The social security records indicate 1951.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Is that what it is? I just don’t remember. It could be 1951.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were working for Rhea Manufacturing Co., and the records
also show that you worked for Smoler Bros., Inc., in Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The Rhea Manufacturing Co. was in Milwaukee, Wis. Did you
live in Milwaukee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And in Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other <span class="locked">words——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I only worked for them out of there. In other words, the only
time that I ever went there is when they had sales meetings, when they called
the people in for sales meetings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were you living then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In Miami.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That same residence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Northwest Fourth Terrace?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your area, sales area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Florida.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just Florida?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You sold women’s apparel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Wholesale?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Wholesalers. They were manufacturers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I notice from these records, too, that apparently during the years
1951, 1952, and 1953, your employer seems to alternate between Smoler Bros.,
Inc., and Hartley’s, whose address is given as 144 East Flagler in Miami.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Hartley’s is a large—it almost looks like a department store
but it is not. It is a large specialty shop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you working for both?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The only time I worked for Hartley’s was, I think it was either
one or two seasons. I don’t remember which. Just for the Christmas holidays
only.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you did work for Hartley’s, did you leave Smoler’s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, Smoler’s continued right on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. In other words, I would probably say maybe a week or
something like that before the Christmas holidays I worked in there. I would
say approximately like that. Approximately a week or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. These records also indicate that actually you worked for Smoler’s
out of Chicago, wherever you actually lived or whatever your territory might
have been, until 1958; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. Smoler’s is the one who forced me to Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. There were two men they were releasing in Dallas, Tex., and it
happened to be I was in Atlanta, Ga., and it happened to be on a Friday, I recall
this very distinctly. My boss called me and I couldn’t imagine what he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
calling me for. He said, “George, we are releasing a couple of men and we
want you to go to Dallas.” And I didn’t want to go. But he said, “You are
going.” So I wound up in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was that? I know you said is was a Friday, but do you
remember the year, the month?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. Oh, wait; yes. It was 10 years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 1954?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Because I have been there—come next month, it will be 10
years I have been there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So the telephone conversation on Friday would have been in
May of 1954, on a Friday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Actually, May 15, I think you said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I think I arrived in Dallas, I think it was May 15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did your wife go with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; she wouldn’t go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you been living together up to that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that the cause of your separation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I believe that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She never did go to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; she wouldn’t go, and I had a job to hold down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She kept the child?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. She kept the child.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And still has it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. And still has it, and, of course, there could have been a possibility
if I didn’t go—I only say possibility—that I could have been released
from my job. This, I only say, there could have been a possibility.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now tell us what you did then in Dallas. You continued to
work, I take it, for Smoler’s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, yes; sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you live? Can you give us a list of the various places
where you lived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The first year I was just living, you know, in motels, from one
place, you know, wherever I was, because I was traveling the State of Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your territory there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The whole of Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I started off the whole thing and then I wound down until I
probably wound up with just a corner of it. And when I wound up with that
there I said this is not for me, because I can’t make it on only part of Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, that comes a little later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you live in Dallas? Give us a list of your various
addresses just roughly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The first place that I actually centrally located in, I don’t
remember the name of the place but I do remember the name of the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I could go to the place and know where it is but I can’t think
of the name of the place, which was on McKinney Avenue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. I would probably say, I’d have to guess, I would
probably say maybe 6 months to a year. I’m not sure now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it an apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; it was an apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I was with a couple other boys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. One fellow by the name of George Guest. George Guest, he
was a, what do you call them, xylophones. He was a musician.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He played the instrument called the xylophone?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What is the one with the woods? It is not xylophone. What is
the one that is made out of wood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Marimba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, it is the marimba. Is the marimba made out of wood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As a musical instrument?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A percussion instrument?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did he work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He played wherever he got engagements. He got booked locally,
out of town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was the other one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The other one who stayed with us a short while, his name was
Mort Seder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He sells men’s apparel, traveling salesman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you maintained contact with either of those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. George Guest got married many, many, years ago. The last
I heard that at that time he had moved to, I think it was Fort Lauderdale by the
sea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the other one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Seder I have seen, the last time I ran across Seder, of course, he
is always traveling, the last time I saw him was, I would probably say in the
last 2 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him often prior to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, sure. We lived together for a while. We lived together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you lived together initially?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then lived together after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, yes. Wait a minute, I’m trying to figure how we broke up.
Oh, yes, we lived together for a while but he wanted his own place. He wanted
to live alone. At that time he was not doing too well and he couldn’t stand the
pressure of having an apartment by himself, at that time. So we lived together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was the first 6 months or so when you settled in that place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. It happened to be that we both almost got divorced
around the same time. He was living in Houston at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, so that accounts, I take it, for your residence at the
McKinney Street address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that broke up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; from there it broke up and Seder and I moved to another
place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That was on Shadyside Lane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how long did you live there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This is another guess. I would probably say 6 months to a
year, with a guess again, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is you and Seder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; Seder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you go from there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Columbia Avenue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you live there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would probably say we may have lived there maybe a couple
of years. I’m not sure now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were still with Seder then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; and that is where he wanted to have his own place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So he left you, as it were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you remain at the Columbia Avenue address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I remained there for a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then what happened?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I remained there for a while and then he stayed there. I’m
trying to figure where I went from there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After you left Seder, if you left the apartment in which you
were living with Seder at Columbia Avenue, do you recall whether you <span class="locked">then——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I stayed there for a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You stayed there for a while alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I had my own place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you moved next, did you move in with somebody else or
were you alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I moved in with somebody else. I’m trying to think where,
though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It might help if you remember who it was that you lived with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think I moved to the Oasis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that an apartment house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; these are all apartment houses—the various places. They
have all been apartment houses. That was on Live Oak. I believe that is
where I moved next.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whom did you share that apartment with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I stayed there with two other boys, Ronnie Unger and Kenny—I
can’t think of his last name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you live there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Pardon me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you live there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Let me get to this first, please. After I moved, when I moved
in with them, the thing I was trying to figure out before I got there, now I got
through with Smoler Brothers and I can’t think of what year. Do you have a
listing of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Our records indicate you last worked for Smoler’s, or rather,
that there is no more income reported from Smoler’s after July of 1958.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is probably when I got through, in 1958. That is when I
got through with Smoler’s, in 1958. I don’t remember when I was with Smoler’s
that I was still living at Columbia Avenue or not. I may have been living there
yet. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, we have the sequence of your addresses and the last place
was at the Oasis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, from Oasis where did you go to live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Where I moved to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. From the Oasis I think, I’m not sure now but I think from the
Oasis, I think I went on the road for 9 months and just lived all over, if I recall
right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you working with Smoler’s then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I’m not sure I went from the Oasis. I don’t remember
if <span class="locked">I——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s see if this will assist your memory. The social security
reports indicate that after the second quarter of 1958, which would mean after
July of 1958, you reported no income or no earnings were reported, put it that
way, for the last half of 1958, for all of 1959, for all of 1960, and for all of 1961.
Now, can you tell us what you were doing and where you were living for those
3½ years, starting from July of 1958 until <span class="locked">apparently——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. July of 1958?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. July of 1958 until apparently the beginning of 1962, when you
were employed by the Volume Sales Co. and Merchandise Mart, Dallas. That
is 3½ years there and I would like to know just what you were doing and
where you were living?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I don’t know if I can put them all together right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do the best you can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Now, when I was still living on Columbia Avenue, I don’t remember
if I was still with Smoler’s then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case you moved to the Oasis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I moved to the Oasis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From the Oasis and after you left Smoler’s whenever it was,
you got on the road.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Wait; after I left Smoler’s, I had a couple of odd jobs traveling
which did not mean too much because they were not top lines and moneywise
there was no money to really be made. These were odds, and then I finally
got back with Rhea again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. R-h-e-a?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. R-h-e-a. Rhea Manufacturing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Milwaukee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Milwaukee. I got back with Rhea again, I don’t remember
what year. But anyhow, in between that I would almost say there could be
a span with a rough guess approximately about a year and a half I was
unemployed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you manage to sustain yourself by way of paying normal
expenses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I was cooking for the boys and doing odd things for them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you living in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All that period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, during the period we are talking about, the
3½ years from July of 1958 until January of 1962, you never did change your
residence from Dallas, even though you might be traveling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. January of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s get this part settled. From the time you left Smoler’s,
you were definitely living in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever actually establish a residence of a permanent nature
other than in Dallas any place else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that even though you were traveling during those years,
doing odd jobs or for Rhea’s, you always lived in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; wait, there was one time, excuse me, I was staying with
a friend of mine in Houston. There was one time, I remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. But actually, that still wasn’t a permanent residence because
I was traveling with this guy because I was unemployed and I used to help
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. His name is George Hamrah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you spell it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. H-a-m-r-a-h.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He still lives in Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; he still lives in Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So aside from that period that you are talking about, you
always lived in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you bring us forward then as to your residence from the
Oasis on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. From the Oasis I believe now, I believe from the Oasis I went
to Jack Ruby’s, if I am not mistaken. I think I moved in with Jack.</p>

<p>Wait, I’ll tell you when I moved in with Jack. It was in February or
March, I’m not sure now, of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you think that you were in the Oasis in the interval.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no; wait, wait. Before I moved in, excuse me, yes, I
moved in with Jack from the Oasis. Now I lived in three different places in
the Oasis with different boys because I was unemployed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We are not particularly interested in the apartment numbers
in the Oasis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But we are in the names of the people that you lived with at
the Oasis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I gave you the <span class="locked">names——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of two of them, as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Of one apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Right. Then another apartment I lived in, the fellow, his name
was Frank Irwin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The other one was James Young, and the other one was—this
is all in one apartment. I can’t think of the other one’s name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you seen them in the last few years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, the last time I saw any of them was around the latter
part of last year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Even the man whose name you don’t know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Even the man whose name I don’t know. I’m trying to think
of his name. I shouldn’t forget it. I think it is John.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Perhaps it will come to you in a minute. We will come back
to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I shouldn’t forget his name as long as I’ve known him. I just
can’t put my <span class="locked">finger——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you lived with those people at the Oasis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At various apartments?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Until January or February of 1962 when you moved in with
Jack Ruby; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was Ruby living then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Ruby was living at the <span class="locked">Marsalla—</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Palace?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. There is a bunch of apartments there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Marsalla South?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It may have been Marsalla South.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is actually a Marsalis Street; is there not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; but there is an apartment, a few begin with Marsalla,
Marsalla Apartments or Marsalla South. This one here was on Marsalla on
the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was on Marsalis Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you live with Jack then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. At that time I stayed, I lived with him approximately 5 to
6 months; something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Anybody else live there with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; just Jack and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the occasion for your leaving him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I left him because I had a chance to go into the postcard business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How does that relate to leaving Jack? You still lived in Dallas;
did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, sure. I never left Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you live after you left Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. After I left who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Ruby. Now, incidentally, I judge from the dates that that
would have been around in September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. August.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. August of 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; August.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you go then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I moved in with a fellow whose name was Stan Corbat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And where was that apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That was on Maple Avenue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say that the reason why you moved from Jack’s was because
you got a chance to be a salesman in the postcard business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How does that relate, how does your getting this employment
relate to your moving from Jack’s apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Jack likes to live alone in the overall picture. First of all,
it is an interference of the time that I wake up and the time that he goes to
bed which don’t coincide. That is part. And then Jack don’t live too clean.
I mean he is a type—in other words, he comes home, he is reading a newspaper,
on the floor, if he is in the bathroom the newspaper goes on the floor and things
of that nature. Though he was very clean about himself, he wasn’t clean around
the apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I judge from what you tell me then that your real reasons
for moving were those that you just mentioned rather than the fact that you got
employment selling postcards? Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Why I moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Please run that back again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I say I judge from what you have said that the real reason
for your moving from the apartment with Jack in 1962 was your dissatisfaction
with the living conditions rather than that you got a job selling postcards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; not necessarily. I mean that is part of it. That is not
necessarily it; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How does the postcard job, selling postcards, contribute or
how did it contribute to the fact that you had to move from Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, I didn’t have to. I didn’t have to; but this way here I
started to get self-sustaining a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, I see. So you had a steady job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; see, the other way, when I was living with Jack, of course,
I was helping him at the club. I was helping him at the club, and, of course,
I abided by everything he said and did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So the reasons for moving then, were a combination of factors.
One, that you were dissatisfied generally with the living conditions as you
have indicated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is only partially it. I had a chance to go out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were financially better off and you had a chance to go
with Corbat, and you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how long did you stay with Corbat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. When I went in with Corbat, of course, he only had a one-bedroom
apartment and I had to sleep on the couch again. I slept on so
many couches lately. So I told Stan, I told this friend of mine, Corbat, when
we were staying on Maple Avenue, that just as soon as I get a little extra money
I want to get a two-bedroom apartment and that is where I moved into this
last apartment, 225 South Ewing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was about when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I moved in there, I believe it was the latter part of November
of 1962, we found a nice two-bedroom apartment that was very reasonable.
I told Jack about it and Jack moved next door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But he moved later than you, didn’t he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, see, I moved in first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With Corbat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. Yes; first I went in alone, no furniture or nothing. I
moved in alone and I was there approximately about a week or something like
that, and Corbat stayed over at the other place because he wanted to finish
the balance of the month out. He wanted his last days in there, you know, for
we paid for the rent, and then he moved in right after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He moved in with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was in November of 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I believe it was the latter part of November of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did Ruby move in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He moved in around that same time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But after you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I would probably say within the week I would probably
say, something like that, within that week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then you stayed there until when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The unfateful day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t live with Corbat all that while?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I lived with Corbat from the time we moved in there until
August.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; now, the reason Corbat moved <span class="locked">out——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Ruby had another apartment in the same building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, yes; we lived, you know, one apartment next to the other.
Now, the reason Corbat moved was because he got married August 8, and there
I was in the apartment alone and I couldn’t handle it alone. But I did stay
there 2 months with a struggle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So then when did you move from that apartment to Ruby’s apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It was the first week in November of 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By the way, would you state for the record what was the number
of the apartment you and Corbat had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know the number. I said Maple Avenue. The apartment
was Granberry. You mean on Maple Avenue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Room number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; on South Ewing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. 223 South Ewing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the apartment number that you lived in with Corbat
which was next door, you say, to Jack’s and what was Ruby’s number. I want
to get that in the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think Ruby’s was 206 and mine was 207, if I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They were next to one another, or opposite?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; in other words, you go along this corridor. There is one
apartment here. Right next door there is another apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And they are numbered in sequence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; 206, I believe his was 206 and mine was 207, something like
that. I think it was 206 and 207.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, for a moment, let’s go back to Frank Irwin, who was one of
your roommates. Have you seen him lately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, I have not seen Frank in, oh, I imagine it must be a couple
years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was he doing when you last saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What does he do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was he doing then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I believe he is a guard for the Bell Helicopter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about James Young?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. James Young works for a finance—I think it is a finance corporation
called Warner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you last see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I saw him, he was coming through, he was working out of El
Paso and he was being transferred, I think he said to Oklahoma City, and I
saw him that one day, rather, that one night in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. At night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; what day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time of the year, what month?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, I think it was in December.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think so, in December 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When had you seen him prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Prior to that time? I don’t remember. It could have been a
couple years, I guess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you mentioned that there was another man, a third
<span class="locked">man——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whose name you couldn’t remember at the time. Can you remember
his name now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Jack Loftus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. L-o-f-t-u-s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, that is correct, Jack Loftus, and he lives in Hillsboro, if he
is still there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is his occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think he works for a newspaper down there now in Hillsboro.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, Hillsboro, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was the last time you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I saw him the same night I saw Young. I may have seen him
after that. I know I have seen him a couple of times, but I don’t remember if
it was after that or before that. I don’t remember that, but I do definitely
remember seeing him the last time in December. This part I do remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was the same day you saw Young?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that just a coincidence or was it a plan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no; no coincidence. They were looking for me and I’ll tell
you where I saw him. I saw him up at Jack Ruby’s club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was after Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They were looking for you for what reason?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. For what reason were they looking? Why were they looking
for you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Just friends, that is all, because I had lived with them, you
know, for a while. Nothing particular.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I suppose, too, they had known that you were in the apartment
with Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, it was national news.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. They had read of the incident or heard of the incident somehow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long was that after Ruby killed Oswald that you saw them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. These two boys?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think it was in December now. I don’t remember if it was a
week, two or three. I’m not sure. I just don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you relate it to say Christmastime, Christmas day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It could be. I just can’t think of when it was. Possibly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long prior to then had you seen Loftus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, say before Oswald was shot. How long had it been since
you had seen Loftus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Let me put it this way: I can’t quote it. I really can’t quote
it, but I would say that he lived in Hillsboro and he used to come up on weekends
and I believe he stayed with his friend in Irving, Frank Irwin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the friend’s name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Frank Irwin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I-r-w-i-n?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I-r-w-i-n, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that person lived in Irving, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Irving, yes; he lived in Irving. Now I used to run across him
once in a while. He used to come up you know for the weekend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he know Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, he knew him casually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about these others, Frank Irwin and James Young?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know if they knew Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Stanley Corbat know him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Casually, because Stanley and I lived next door to him. But,
of course, Stan never went to his club unless I took him there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Stan got married, of course, and that is why he moved out of
the apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where is he living now, in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know the number, but I think he is living on Munger
Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you seen him since Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you come in contact with him, socially?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I just happened to run across him one day. I ran across him
once in a delicatessen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just once?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In the delicatessen. I ran across him once in a delicatessen.
Then I ran across him another time. As a matter of fact, I ran across him I
think it was twice since the happenings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What does he do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He is a buyer for a department store. He buys women’s budget
dresses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Which department store?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Titche.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where is that located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is I think on Main Street. I think it is on Main Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me ask you a few other questions about yourself.</p>

<p>Have you ever been in any difficulties with the law, that is to say, by way of
charges?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; the only incident I ever had with the law, and I have been
asked many times before on this already, that one night—this goes back maybe
3 or 4 years ago—there was another chap and I, we went to a cocktail lounge
and we both had two scotches and water. We crossed the street and I think we
crossed the street against the light because in Dallas they are very meticulous
of crossing against the lights, and we went into the coffee shop to get something
to eat. We no sooner got in the coffee shop than two cops nabbed me, us rather.
They said we were drunk. Now I wasn’t any more drunk than he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they charge you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; they took us down to jail, 4 hours to sober up, but I had
nothing to sober up with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they follow up with any charges?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; we were fined $15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were fined?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I believe it was $15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that the only time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The only time in my life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The only time you have ever been arrested?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There have been no other charges?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Also I gather from the fact that you got an honorable discharge,
that you had no difficulties with military justice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. During the war?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Never, none whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, while you were living in Miami, did you have occasion to
get to know or meet or make friends with, either one, any person who would be
classified as gamblers, professional gamblers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Professional?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go to any gambling houses?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Me? No; of course I’m certain there must be sneak gambling
you know, like anyone else. They call it sneak gambling, you know, you do it
under cover. But at that time when I got down there, I think it was either shut
down or close to being shut down. I don’t remember just what year it was.
They just clamped down, you know.</p>

<p>Of course, I remember when I first went there as a kid, everything was open.
Slot machines used to be on the streets and all that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you yourself ever done any gambling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I’m no gambler. When you put it this way, I will put it
this way: You mean have I played poker at home, 5 and 10 or something like
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; the only time that I ever did any gambling was when I was
overseas. I was in the jungles for approximately 3 years. What other recreation
did we have? So we gambled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I want to explore a bit more the means by which you obtained
money to live during the 2½ years that you were apparently unemployed, at
least no earnings were reported, that is to say, from July of 1958 until the first
of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. According to the records, there were no earnings reported for you
by anybody nor did you apparently report any yourself from July roughly of
1958 until January 1 of 1962, or the first part of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Approximately about 4 weeks ago the Internal Revenue had me
and they called me right after I got off the witness stand at the Jack Ruby trial
that they wanted to see me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. They gave me a notice to come up and see them. They allowed
me 10 days to come up and see them, which I did.</p>

<p>When I was unemployed, when I lost my job I think it was in 1958, when I
was with Rhea, which is a very depressing feeling, I don’t know how to explain
this, I really don’t know how to explain it to you, I didn’t file. Why I didn’t
file I can’t even answer, I don’t know why I didn’t file.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before you get to that, maybe we ought to get to this part.</p>

<p>You say you lost your job. You are talking about being with Smoler’s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; that was with Rhea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were with Smoler’s a long time. What caused you to lose
your job there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. With Smoler Brothers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. As I say, they weren’t happy with me and I wasn’t happy with
them.</p>

<p>First of all, I’ll tell you they had cut down the territory and they were
unhappy with the type business I was doing. So, this was a volume house, and
the type operation was, I don’t know if I classify, if I tell you $3.75 a dress, I
don’t know if it means anything to you or not, but at this price range, at the
wholesale price range, you have got to do a volume business to make any money.
And through this they weren’t happy. And I wasn’t happy because they had
cut my territory down so, so we parted good friends. I wasn’t making any
money anyhow over that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you had times with Smoler’s when you had done considerably
better?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. There were times that I did better. I don’t say that I did a
fantastic job with them, but I have done a little better than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you been able to make any savings to carry you forward?</p>

<p>You see, that is what I want to get at. We find when you left Smoler’s, you
go to <span class="locked">Rhea’s——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Excuse me, before I went to Rhea I had other odd jobs you
know that were nothing to speak of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Here is what I want to get at.</p>

<p>Here is a period of 2½ years, you had to have some money to live on or people
gave you money or something of that sort. Now tell us about that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I lived on handouts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I lived on handouts. When I mentioned these boys here and
I was living on handouts with them. In other words, I used to cook for them
and wash dishes and things of that nature. I was really depressed, extremely
depressed and down and out, and they slipped me five, three, two, whatever
it was, and I helped them along in the house there and they kept me for a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not pay any part of the rent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that is true for that whole 2½-year period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It wasn’t two and a half. I would say it was approximately
a year and a half, to my knowledge. I don’t think it was 2½ years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You went from Smoler Brothers to Rhea directly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no; I say I had the odd jobs directly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how much time was there between Smoler Brothers and
Rhea?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think there was much time between them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What would you say, 3 months?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It’s hard for me to really guess. I’d have to make such a
fantastic guess I wouldn’t know if I was right or wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This was not too long ago. This was back in 1957.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, if I told you 3 months I don’t know how close I’d be and
if I told you 6 months I don’t know how far I’d be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You say you had odd jobs. Can you be more specific?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, I was with another dress house for a short while, which
didn’t last too long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Doing the same kind of work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, doing the same kind of work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Covering territory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, they were with a top house. I didn’t stay with them long
and I wasn’t making any money with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What company was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Junior Age. I don’t believe they are in business any more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long would you say you were with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It may have been 3 months. I don’t know, 2 months, 4 months.
I’m not sure. It wasn’t too long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you on a straight commission with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. No, a draw against commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. A draw against commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But if you didn’t make your draw, you were in the hole with
them and had to pay it back supposedly, somehow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I didn’t pay it back, but I was in the hole, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But after you left this dress house, who did you work for next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I’m trying to think from the time there until Rhea. I know
I did some odd things. I was with <span class="locked">Rhea——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were these odd things always in the same line, or did you get
into other lines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I worked in a little bare place, I think I lasted, I worked
there for about 6 weeks once at hardly nothing, just to keep me going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And that was before you worked for Rhea, or was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I think that was after. I think that was after I worked
for Rhea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did the Rhea employment last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I may have been with them maybe a year, year and a half,
I’m not sure now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you make any money off of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Just a draw part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you on the handout basis when you were working for Rhea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
that is to say, handout with your roommates, or did you have enough money
then to pay your fair share?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, no; I paid my fair share as long as I <span class="locked">was——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So when you are talking about the <span class="locked">handouts——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The handouts is when I was completely out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t have any employment at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, I was completely out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was for about a year, year and a half?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say about a year and a half at a rough guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did that begin and when did that end, that year and a half?
Let’s look at it this way: You were not working at the time you were living
with Ruby, were you, that is to say you were not making any money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were not contributing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. Ruby gave me handouts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that is a year and a half back from November of 1963, is it
not, roughly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, I was with this Volume Sales like you mentioned before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I was with them. Now, I was with Volume for maybe about
9 months, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s take the time that you were with Corbat. Was that on
a handout basis too, or did you pay your fair share then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; with Corbat I paid him very little. I’ll tell you when I
paid him very little, though. I paid him very little when I first moved in with
him, because I had no money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then you <span class="locked">got——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Then when I moved, when I was able to a little, we went on a
50-50 basis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is when you moved to South Ewing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which was in August of 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were you making money at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The cards. My half of the rent was $62.50 a month and his
half. In other words, it ran about $15 a week, approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you earned enough to pay your half by selling postcards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I was in the postcards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is what business? What company is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Texas Postcard &amp; Novelty Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long were you with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I was sales manager, whatever that means.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long were you with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. August of 1962 until November of 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What part of November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The latter part of November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you ceased your employment with them after Oswald
was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; this is when I fell apart with the incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What were you making then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. $75 a week, but $61.45, that is my actual draw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was your actual draw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In cash?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Roughly $250 a month?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you said you paid your half of the rent with Corbat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; $15 a week, $16 a week, or whatever it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then when you lost that employment—just a minute; you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
had not lost that employment at the time you moved in with Ruby, because you
say that that <span class="locked">employment——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no, no; you mean prior <span class="locked">to——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were still working with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were still drawing that pay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you mean when you said a little while ago that you
were on a handout basis with Ruby since you were making $250?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I am referring to the first time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That was in 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were living in another place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; in 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But with reference to the last time you lived with Ruby; that is
to say, commencing the beginning of November of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You <span class="locked">were——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I was under pressure those 2 months because the rent—you
know, when you switch from $62.50 to $125 you are going broke.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From the time you left Corbat until you moved with <span class="locked">Ruby——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I struggled for the 2 months, and Jack Ruby said to move in,
so I moved in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And were you supposed to pay any part?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. With Jack, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The arrangement was that you were not to pay anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I wasn’t to pay, but you know I would help him. I would help
him Fridays and Saturdays, or once in a while I would pop up during a week
night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you something to get it straight about this Rhea
Manufacturing Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did they do? What did they make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. They manufacture dresses and sportswear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I notice your social security earnings record with Smoler Bros.,
that there seemed to be times regularly where you did not report any earnings
from them, or they did not report any payments to you I should say, to be more
accurate. Was there something seasonal about that business with Smoler Bros.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The type business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; every season wasn’t good. In other words, let me put it
this way: When you get down to the latter part of the year, you know, see, we
are more so of a cotton housecoat, not a housecoat but a cotton dress. You have
seen these women wear these inexpensive cotton dresses. They look like plaid
variations. Well, this wasn’t a big factor at that time of the year. In other
words, our spring and our summer was the best for us as far as selling goes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And the spring and the summer were you selling for the spring
and summer seasons, or were you selling in the spring and summer for the following
season?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Let me explain it this way: I’m certain we are both on the right
track, but let me explain it this way. In other words, we will start in May.
In May your fall lines come out, see, come out, and you start selling them in May.
Some of them sell them in April, even. It all depends who the manufacturer
is and how fast they put them out. Then your spring line—let’s see, from the
fall line your spring line will come out in, I think it’s August, August of the year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s see if we cannot get it this way. You never actually ceased
your employment with Smoler’s at any time until the final time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, there are periods from these reports that we have in which
Smoler’s apparently did not report any earnings for you. What we want to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
know, is: Is it a fact that you did not earn anything during that period or did
not even draw during that period, or have you any explanation for the reason
that Smoler’s apparently did not report any earnings for you during several
years in a row for certain quarters, seemingly for the third and fourth quarter
of each year, and why would that be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you always on a draw right along?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there some periods during each year when you did not
earn your draw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, yes: there were many times I didn’t earn my draw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there anything seasonal about that? Were there certain
times of the year when you were working when it regularly happened that you
did not earn your draw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What times of the year did that tend to be when you did not
earn your draw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I cannot base it on any particular time or periods, but there were
many times, especially when you get chopped down a bit on your loans. I have
never made what you call any big money with them. I was always, I would
imagine, hitting probably around my draw part, or there may have been times
when I fell even behind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I want to get to the time when you first met Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Hubert, I have a couple of questions. I would like to clear
up on some much earlier stuff before you get to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. First of all, where is Gloversville, N.Y.? What part of New
York State is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Are you familiar with Albany?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You are familiar with Schenectady?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. How about Amsterdam?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, if I am not, if you tell us where it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I haven’t been there in so many years I may not have the right
direction now. All I know is I am trying to figure what the locality is. It is
30 miles from Schenectady. In other words, it is off the beaten path a bit from
your main lines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It is upstate New York?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I would probably say in the locale of the foothills of the
Adirondacks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now I perhaps did not catch this, but there was a period in 1947
when you went to work in New Hampshire?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why did you go to New Hampshire?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I needed a job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to go there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The man who was running the Red Rooster—what was the name
of it again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The Hensroost.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; the Hensroost; he was up there for the summer. So he
got me a job up there for the summer. That was another time when I was very
much in need of a job. The type of work that I did up there, they had a little
place where the help used to come in, you know, to eat or drink or buy cigars, separation
from the guest part. This is the part I worked, made them hamburgers
or whatever it may be of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I do not have anything else, Mr. Hubert, if you want to go on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, as I understand it, it was in May of 1954, almost 10 years
ago, that you moved to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How soon after moving to Dallas did you meet Jack Ruby?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say it may have been—I would say approximately about
within a year or approximately about a year; I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not know him prior to moving to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, no; I had never heard of Jack Ruby before in my life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You think it would be somewhere in 1955 that you first met him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would even say in 1955 or early 1956. I mean give or take
a few.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us the circumstances under which you met him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. How I met him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I was with a friend of mine one day. We went over to—I am
certain you heard of the Vegas Club in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is where, you know—at that time this is all Jack Ruby
had was the Vegas Club and this is where I met him casually. Never seen him
before, and I was introduced to Jack Ruby like I guess anybody else walked in,
Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; now, starting from then, would you tell us how your
friendship or acquaintance developed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have seen Jack; I have met Jack here or there, you know; it
can be in a restaurant or whatever it might be or a luncheonette or something
like that. I have met him many times. I have seen him, “Hi, George”; “Hi, Jack,
how are you?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go to the Vegas Club frequently after that first meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, no; very, very seldom, very seldom, and the only time that
I really got close to Jack was about 2 years ago. Always previous to that it has
always been, “Jack, how are you?” wherever I met him; having coffee, he always
offered to buy me something to eat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You describe your relationship with Jack up to 2 years ago as
casual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Strictly casual, like I’d meet any other friend anywhere else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It could hardly be called friendship as it ultimately developed,
in any case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I respected him; he respected me. We talked nice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not go to the Vegas very much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I didn’t go to the Vegas very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the time you indicated that there was a change in that casual
relationship to something else 2 years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us what brought that about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. (Brief recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Senator, we have had about a 10-minute recess. You understand,
of course, that we are continuing this deposition by the same authority and
under the same conditions which I stated to you at the very beginning of it,
and further that you are under the same oath that you were prior to the recess.
Is that agreeable with you? You understand that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I can’t lie because I didn’t bring a lawyer with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I said I am not lying because I didn’t bring a lawyer with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that the record may be clear on the point, I want to see if
I understand your last remark. Does it indicate that you wish to have a
lawyer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I just wanted to get it straight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I say that I didn’t come here to lie; so I don’t need a lawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, now we are at the point about 2 years ago when a
casual relationship which you have described with Ruby changed into something
else. Why don’t you just tell us about that in your own words?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. All right. I mentioned before Volume Sales. When I got
through with Volume Sales I was unemployed again, and I used to jump up to
Jack’s place, his other place, which is the Carousel. Previous to that there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
the Sovereign Club, a private club. On rare occasions I used to go up there
and we started getting a little more friendly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was about 2 years ago or prior to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; that was while I was still with Volume Sales. In other
words, that was, I would say, approximately about 2½ years ago. I used to
go up to the Sovereign Club; you know it is a private club; they don’t let you
in normally, but he used to let me in to watch the show.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember actually when that opened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Which?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The Sovereign.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember when it changed from the Sovereign to the
Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I wasn’t around for the change, but I would say that it was
over 2 years ago. Now just how much over, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you concur in the suggestion that it would be approximately
Christmas of 1961, which would be about 2 years and 5 or 6 months?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That it changed to the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I couldn’t quote that. I couldn’t even quote it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can I interrupt you here Mr. Hubert? How did you happen
to come to terminate your employment with Volume Sales?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You have got to know the man. He is a hard guy to work for.
He was really a tough guy to work for. You see, No. 1, he is a salesman himself,
and he is a pretty shrewd salesman, and he had Volume Sales, which were
novelty, sort of novelty and gift item type things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Novelties? Well that would be variations. In other words, you
probably have seen these little things with different sayings on them. Remember
the little miniature loving cups with the different sayings on them? Things of
this nature, and other gag items and key chains and little bar sets and little
weather sets and things of that nature, and funny matches. Just a variation
of those things of that nature. And when I traveled for him and I’d get back
to town, he would knock me off $50. In others words, my draw wasn’t stable
with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you first started to visit the Sovereign Club, as you say
Jack would let you in, I take it you didn’t have membership in the Sovereign
Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; because I think at the Sovereign Club I probably attended
that place maybe three or four times or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Mr. Ruby running the same kind of shows at the Sovereign
Club that he later had at the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, no; he was running acts, you know, he had acts, singers or
dancers or comedians, something of that nature you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have striptease performance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; the Sovereign; no; there were no strippers when he had
the Sovereign Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you familiar with the other nightclubs in town when Mr.
Ruby had the Sovereign Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, I knew some of them; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you visit any of those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. On rare occasions; yes. I couldn’t afford them, number one.
I was never a member because I couldn’t afford membership. I wasn’t making
that kind of money. But I’d either go up with a friend who was a member or
something of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there something about the Sovereign Club that was more
attractive to you than some of the other clubs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; not particularly; no. It is just that I knew Jack and Jack
said like he said a thousand times to many people. First of all the Carousel
of course is a $2 admission. But many people would say “Come on up, be my
guest,” free admission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know any other nightclub operators in town at the
time Jack was running the Sovereign Club and letting you in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, normally on getting into clubs I would probably go in
with a friend who was a member. You probably know the Kings Club and the
Adolphus don’t you or you heard of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; for example did you know the manager of the Theatre
Lounge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. As of recent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Back there when you were going to the Sovereign Club and
Jack would let you in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I knew who the owner was but I didn’t know the manager,
who the manager was at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You know Abe Weinstein?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, yes; I don’t know him that well. I know who he is, I know
him casually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you visited his clubs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. On very rare occasions. Abe’s place I have probably been up
maybe as long as I have been in Dallas, if I have been up there four times I have
been up there a lot, if I have been up there that many times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; now we had progressed to the point where your casual
relationship with Jack Ruby had developed into a little more than that commencing
roughly about 2½ years ago when you began to go to the Sovereign
Club. I think you went there about four or five times before it changed to
the Carousel. But you have previously mentioned that about 2 years ago
something happened that changed this improving relationship let’s say in the
sense that you got to know each other better, so that you could be called friends
then. Something happened you said about 2 years ago, and that is what I
want you to take it from there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. When I got through with Volume Sales I was unemployed again.
In other words, I was down again. So Jack Ruby is of a nature, he will help
somebody. Rather he has to feed them or give them a place to sleep or something
of this nature, this is when he took me in when he knew I was broke.
He said “George you can stay with me.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell him you were broke or did he find out from another
source?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I told him I was down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ask to go in with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I’ll tell you why. I don’t think I did. At that time Jack
was changing over and he had some pretty rough times. He had changed over
from this Sovereign Club. Now how rough he had it there I don’t know because
I wasn’t intimate with him at that time, that intimate. And he went into this
burlesque business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the Carousel you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The Carousel and he was bucking somebody who had never been
bucked before. That is the Weinstein brothers who owned the Theatre Lounge
and the Colony Club and who have had the monopoly of that type nature of
business for many, many years. Now, for him to buck them he has really got
something to buck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So he was having difficulties and you were too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; originally I was sleeping at the club and so was he.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean he didn’t have an apartment at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He didn’t have an apartment at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did that situation go on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It didn’t last too long, because as business started to pick up
some he was sleeping, he had his own room in the club and he had a fold-out bed
that I could sleep on and I slept there for awhile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that originally when Jack took you in, as it were, to assist
you, he took you in at the club, and not into any apartment which he then had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He didn’t have an apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is what I say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He didn’t have an apartment at that time. But he was always
good in feeding somebody if they were down and out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean he gave you cash?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Either that or he gave me a little cash for spending money or
he would just take me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just do what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Take me to eat, you know, when he went to eat. He’d pay for
my laundry or have my suit pressed, things of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But then he did get an apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He got an apartment but I don’t remember just how long after
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case when he got an apartment you moved into that
apartment with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. See I am a little blank on one point there. I just don’t remember
how the outcome was when he moved out of there into the apartment. I can’t
remember just how long I stayed up at the club with him. It wasn’t too long,
though. I don’t remember how long. But anyhow he got this apartment on
South Ewing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On South Ewing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; Marsalis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then you moved in with him right away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Then I went in with him. Now I don’t remember if I went
in with him—I don’t remember how I went in with him. I can’t place it together
but I know I was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t have to pay any rent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; but I helped him in the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now when you helped him in the club, what did you do? What
kind of work did you do at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, I sort of ran the lights for him for awhile and I’d take
cash for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean that is on the front door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; on the front door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the $2 admission charge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what other jobs did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Whatever errands he wanted me to do during the course of the
daytime, if he wanted me to pick up something here or pick up something there
or buy something that he needed for the club, go shopping and things of that
nature, whatever it might be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t do the clean-up jobs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. He had a clean-up boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. His name was Andrew Armstrong I believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he there when you first went there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. He was with Jack quite awhile. He was with Jack, I
think he was with Jack before I was there, yes, and he was there until the time
the club closed down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you travel around with Jack during this period when you
were unemployed and he was helping you out and you were helping him out by
doing errands and so forth? I mean when you got up in the morning did you
both go together? Did you move together or how was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It all depends. First of all he slept pretty good. He slept
pretty late. He liked to sleep. And he used to get up in the afternoon and
mess around, sit around the apartment. If the weather was right, I mean if it
happened to be summertime, he is a great fan for swimming. Or he’d just mope
around the place or hang around the apartment house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I am trying to get at is whether your helping him out at
the club was a regular thing or just done once in a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I was doing it regularly. As long as he was keeping me
up, I had to do something, see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is what I had in mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go to the club at the same time that he did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you leave at the same time that he did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would leave when he left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Because you were both going back to the same house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about going there? You went earlier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, yes; I left earlier. In other words he could sit in the apartment
longer than I could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you normally go to work then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He would always make me go in in early, somewheres around
between 7 and 8. He wanted me to see that things were set up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never had to go in midafternoon though?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, no; unless if we did go in midafternoon, which was rare,
probably maybe to feed the dogs or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who took care of the reservations and all other matters of that
sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Andrew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did Andrew get there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Andrew was there; Andrew would come there somewhere around
1 o’clock in the afternoon. See Andrew lived there for a short while too after
we had left. He was staying there. And then I think he got married or something
like that. But Andrew was with him about 2 years I guess, maybe a
little longer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you have already covered the next stage, and that was
when you got a job and also you were disgusted with the conditions and so you
moved in with Corbat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now during the period that you lived with Corbat, which would
have been, as I remember it, from August of 1962 until August of 1963—is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your relationship with Jack then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. August of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is when you moved out of Jack’s apartment and took up
with Corbat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I always went to see him. I always used to come up there. At
rare times I would help him at the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you had a job then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. But I would go up there and I would help him at the door,
things of that kind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As a matter of fact, he for a good part of that period he actually
lived in the South Ewing Apartments where you lived with Corbat, is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. We moved there practically the same time; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that in spite of the fact that you broke up the domestic
establishment that you had, there was no ill feeling between you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Never, no, no. We have never had any ill feeling. We got along
excepting when he hollered at me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well we will get to that. In this new job which you had when
you were living with Corbat did you have to use an automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; a wagon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A station wagon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Volkswagen, one of those box things, what do you call them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. One of those Volkswagen microbuses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it a passenger car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; it is one of these solid enclosures. It looks like a box,
you know. I don’t know what you call them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it to hold goods you were displaying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is right; but there was no windows to it except in the
back, the back part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it your car or did it belong to the company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It was the company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you say you continued to go to the Carousel from time to
time. How often about, just roughly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Two or three times a week. It all depends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you would help there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not always. Sometimes I would, sometimes I wouldn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If you helped did he pay you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I did it because I still remember what he has done for
me when I was down and out, and it wasn’t that many hours or it wasn’t
difficult labor or anything of that nature. But I still remembered the
things he did for me, when I was down and out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, then I think we have covered the time when Corbat
left and you lost your job and found that you were down and out and again
you moved into his apartment then, giving up the apartment next door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he invite you in then or did you ask him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he invited me. He knew I was pressed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you had to give up the automobile at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I had the automobile until January.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The fact is I think you told us that you were working with these
people until after Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But at the stress of <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. But the stresses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The stress of having to carry the whole apartment when Corbat
left was one of the factors that put pressure upon you, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; it is the pressure of the extra amount of money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not own an automobile of your own I take it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, when I was traveling the road; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was the last time you owned an automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know, it must have been about 4 or 5 years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think the last one I had was, I think it was a Buick.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you sell it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I don’t remember if I sold it or traded it in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You traded it in for what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I had a Buick once. I mean I had a few Buicks. When I say a
few I mean there might have been about 3, and I had a Ford once I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case you haven’t owned a car of your own for about 4 or
5 years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the last car you owned you must have sold it I suppose.
You couldn’t have traded it in because then you would have gotten a new car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am trying to think what was I doing with the last car. I
think the last car, I think I lost it on payments. I couldn’t keep up the payments
if I am not mistaken, if that is the one. I think that is it. I am not
sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me interrupt a second to clarify one thing in my mind.
You mentioned this Volkswagen. The last time you had it was in January?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now what year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Just a couple of months ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Coming to the first part of November 1963, was that when you
moved in with Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I believe it was somewhere around the 1st or 2d of November,
something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then I suppose you went back to the routine of the general
mode of living and working with him that had existed before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; then I was helping him, I mean I was staying with him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
so I was helping him on weekends. Once in a while I would pop in maybe
on a weekday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, your <span class="locked">operation——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Just at the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your operation insofar as the Carousel is concerned was not like
it was before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Not on a daily basis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just at night, not every night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Normally I would come in on Friday and Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you were still at your job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; after all I was staying there and felt he was entitled to
something, you know, so I’d come in there and help him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you assist in the cooking or anything of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. There was no food. The only food there was, they make pizzas
once in a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t mean at the Carousel, I mean at the house, the apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, yes; but I couldn’t cook right for him. He is a funny guy
in cooking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you do any cooking there at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. If I don’t broil right for him, if I make him eggs, it has
got to be so much of this in the butter because he was watching his diet, and
I got so tired of it I says, “Make your own eggs.” You just couldn’t make anything
right for him. And all meats had to be broiled. He don’t believe in fried
stuff. And he was just hard to cook for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The routine then I suppose is that you were working and you
would come back to the apartment after normal working hours, which would
be around when, 5 or 6 in the evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. To cook for him? That would be rare. I got away from that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am getting to the normal routine as to your relationship. You
had a regular working day I take it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which started off at 8 or so in the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And ended up at 5 or 6 in the evening? He, on the other hand,
would be sleeping in the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I understand would leave the apartment after you got
back at night or before, as a normal thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It wasn’t always necessarily that I came home between 5 and
6 because many times I stayed out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there any kind of a pattern at all to your living in point of
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, no; there is no particular pattern.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about weekends? Was that different?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; not particularly. First of all I always get up before he
does, whether I am working or otherwise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You would help him at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On weekends and if you did I suppose you came back about the
same time he did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. At night? Yes. But as far as I getting up in the morning, I
always got up much earlier than he did. It was just natural. It was natural
for me to get up, and it doesn’t make any difference what particular time I
went to bed at 2, 3, 4 or 5, I am of that nature that I get up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is your regular rising time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say 7, 7:30, sometimes 6 in the morning. A lot of
times it would probably depend what time I go to bed. If I go to bed at
10 o’clock at night I probably wake up at 5 or 5:30 in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about on weekends?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. On weekends? Say like a Sunday. I would probably wake up
at 7:30 or 8 o’clock in the morning on Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Has it been your habit when you get up in the morning you
make yourself a breakfast or what do you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I will tell you, when I wake up in the morning I want
coffee, but I don’t have that appetite in the morning when I get up. It is very
rare that I will eat the moment I wake up in the morning. But I get hungry
maybe an hour or two later or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So on a working day would you go to work, grab a cup of coffee
and go to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no; on working days I go downtown and have my coffee.
I don’t even make it there. Never. I don’t sit there and make coffee in the
morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Any particular place that you eat at regularly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I had a hangout. The Eat Well. There is three places that I
normally went to. Eat Well, I always went there every morning, even on Sunday,
and then the Chefette. Down where the Chefette is in the Hotel Adolphus
and then the Walgren also in the Hotel Adolphus. Those are the three places I
normally was always in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any regular place where you ate lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; there is no particular—I mean I don’t pick my spot where
I eat lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What would you do about dinners?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Dinners I normally would like to go home, for meal, but I ate
more when I was living with Stan or by myself than I did with Jack, because I
just can’t cook of his nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Jack in the habit of coming home for dinner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. A lot of times, yes; and then I would probably say maybe; on
rare occasions, no. It wasn’t necessarily that he had to be home for dinner
because there were many times he also ate out. But he was hard on food,
even at a restaurant he was not easy. It had to be so-so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did the shopping?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Jack did the shopping. I couldn’t do no shopping. I can’t shop
for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So Jack in effect would buy the meat for the meals and he
would plan the meals? Is that the idea? Then you would cook them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He would buy what would suit himself, and if I didn’t like it
that is too bad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have a regular routine of going to a grocery store once a
week and going shopping for a week or how did it work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would probably say something like that. Of course, it all
depends, you know, how much he is buying, how much he is going to buy.
But he always had a lot of meat. He always kept his refrigerator pretty well
filled. He’d buy grapefruits, half a grapefruit and grapefruit juice like crazy.
Holy God, you know he’d wake up in the morning, the number one thing was
that grapefruit. If he bought grapefruit which he’d normally buy 6, 8, 10 of
them at a clip, he would cut up about 2 of them, 2 at once mind you, and put
them through the wringer and wring them down, you know, the machine he
had home and drink solid grapefruit juice, but from 2 of them, 2 whole grapefruits,
unless he had the frozen grapefruits which he diluted with water. This
is number one before he did anything, the grapefruit bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did this pattern prevail both when you were living with him the
first time and when you were living with him the second time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or was there some difference in your relationship?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; there was no difference. His way of living was set before
I ever heard of Jack Ruby, his way of eating.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He would do all the shopping? Who would decide on any particular
evening what the meal was going to be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I had no say. I had no say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would he call you in advance to let you know when he was
coming back for dinner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; no call; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What would you do? Did you have a time when you liked to
eat, if Jack wasn’t there that you would?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. If he wasn’t there then I’d help myself or even if I made a couple
of eggs or whatever it might be. Sure, I mean there was no particular time
that I had to sit down and eat with him, because if I wasn’t there he ain’t waiting
for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If you felt like eating dinner, would you go into the icebox and
pull out a steak and make some potatoes and do what you wanted to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; sure, sure. If he wasn’t there, look, I am not going to sit
there and wait for him, you know. And he certainly isn’t sitting there waiting
for me, because I probably don’t know what time he is going to be home and
he probably doesn’t know what time I am going to be home or sometimes we
may be there together. But there was no set pattern. There was no particular
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I gather from all this, from the fact that your acquaintanceship
with Ruby ripened into friendship, and ripened further in the fact that you were
sharing an apartment together, that you got to know the man pretty well as a
man, and knew his habits?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I knew something about them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. His likes and dislikes. You expressed an opinion about that
already and that is what I would like to get to now with reference to particular
areas. You have mentioned the question of dogs, and I would like you to tell
us about what you know of him with reference to dogs and his attitude towards
them and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He had enough of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I gather from that you mean he had plenty of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He had a few dogs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All the time that you have known him was that so or when
did that begin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, I don’t know when it began because he had dogs the first
time that I got close to him or acquainted with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is about 2½ years ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you don’t know anything about the dogs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Previous to that I didn’t know anything about dogs before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I guess the number of dogs varied, didn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It happened to be why he had so many dogs, his dog Sheba, who
was attacked by one of Sheba’s sons at a later date, gave birth to six at one time.
What are you going to do? He had dogs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So he kept them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. He didn’t want to give them away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did he keep them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. They were born in the apartment. He had them in the kitchen
until they were old enough, you know, whatever age that they might be, a month
or two, and then he brought them down to the club and he puts them way in the
back room of the club. He used to bring everybody in “See my dogs.” Of course,
his pet was Sheba, which everybody in this country knows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She was the mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; that was the mother of the whole crew. So he wound up
<span class="locked">with——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Sheba stay at the club or at his house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Both. Jack goes to the club, Sheba goes with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Sheba was always with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; this was the only one. I would say on rare occasions he
would probably bring the other dog home or two, just overnight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He gave some of the dogs away didn’t he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; Jack had close to 10 dogs. He had about 9 or 10 dogs.
Don’t forget Sheba had six at one clip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was his attitude towards these animals? Was it a normal
attitude that people have to dogs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I know people have mentioned it to me before in the past and the
quotations that I have heard though I have never heard them from him though
I have heard them otherwise like “My family” or “My wife.” I have read these.
I am certain everybody else has too or heard it. But he liked dogs. To me
this has no meaning. To me it has no meaning when he says this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear these comments made by other people concerning
Ruby and his dogs prior to the shooting or afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Prior to the shooting or afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Prior I don’t recollect. I don’t say—it had to be prior to. No;
it had to be prior.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have read perhaps a lot about the <span class="locked">dogs——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Since the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I heard somebody mention once that he went up to see his Rabbi
Silverman who I am certain you probably heard of I guess, and I don’t know if
he had two or three dogs with him or what it was. I’m not sure of the words he
used but I think he said to the Rabbi “I want you to meet my family” or something
like that. There was a quotation he used. Now this may have been it,
I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there other people that you remember who commented to
you about Ruby and his dogs? You have mentioned one. That is that he <span class="locked">was——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I heard two things already. One was “my family” and one was
“my wife,” which absolutely <span class="locked">has——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Both of those you heard prior to the time Jack went to jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; these were prior to it, but when I heard it it was after,
see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see. You mean that the remarks were made prior?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The remarks were made after, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Wait a while, let me get that straight, the remarks were made
after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. After.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But the occurrences were supposed to have, the facts were supposed
to have occurred prior?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Prior. Right. Prior I never heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You do not remember having heard anything prior to the
shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your own opinion as to his attitude toward these
animals?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Like any other human being who had a dog for a number of
years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There was nothing abnormal about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Nothing. To me, there was nothing absolutely abnormal about
it. Just like anybody else having a dog, and I am certain anybody who has a
dog he has had about 5, 6 or 7 or 8 years who is very much attached to him.
I would probably say the overall picture of the majority owners are attached to
a particular dog of whatever the dog may be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is some rumor if you want to call it that that at some time
or another Jack had a strange sort of relationship with one of the dogs. Have
you any comment to make on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t listen to that stuff because it is not true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, you never saw anything of that sort yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Never, never, and I tell you this from my heart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From your knowledge of Ruby and his relationship with the dog,
do you think that that is likely or unlikely?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From your knowledge of Ruby and of his relationship with those
animals do you think that such a story is likely or unlikely?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That he would have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; that is so far-fetched I don’t believe in that stuff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you be a little bit more explicit about why you feel that
way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, I feel that I have been around him enough to see him pet
the dog, and I pet the dog many times. I picked up the dog many times like
anybody else has picked up a dog and just scratched him on the head but I
have never seen an incident like this, at no time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about his interest in physical culture and keeping himself
in good shape? There have been some reports about that but you are in a position
perhaps to give us further details about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, he loves to swim, and when he gets into a pool he can
really go from one end to the other and go, because I heard it mentioned one
time he said “George you know I used to be able to swim 2 or 3 miles” which I
would probably say is a pretty good distance. I know I can’t do anything
like that, or nowheres near it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he do any ice skating?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, we were ice skating once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he good at it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He was good because—I’ll tell you why he was good, because
he had never been on ice skates before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You just know of one occasion he had been on ice skates?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You just know of one occasion that he was on ice skates?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I was with him and a group of people one time. They asked
me to go, too, and did I suffer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was the first time he had been, too, to your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know if that was the first time we had been. I mean I
was only there one time. That was over at the fair ground in Dallas, but
he had been I think twice. And the people who he was with, you know, we
had some of the show folks there of the help, the people who worked there,
thought he did very well for a man who had never been on ice skates, including
his age.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he take any regular exercise so far as you knew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; his dumbbells. He didn’t do them every day but he did
them quite often. Not the dumbbells; what do you call the things, weightlifters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Weightlifting equipment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He had them in the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, he exercised and very frequently he used to go to the
YMCA which he went for quite a long while. He has gone to the Y before
I ever knew him or even became acquainted with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was his general physical condition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Excellent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he a powerful man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. A powerful man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I’ll tell you, I won’t want to get rapped by him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever heard of any of his episodes in which he tangled
with people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have never had the pleasure—I can’t say pleasure. I have
never really witnessed a battle with him. Now I have seen him poke a couple
of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean between him and other people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I have seen him poke a couple people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about those, would you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Take for instance in the club. All right, here is a man who is
of a temperament you know, he is a temperament man. He has a temper.
And I would probably say that he flies off, if you want to compare us, I am
an angel when it comes to flying off compared to him, because he can go this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
fast, you know. I mean he can fly off pretty well. If somebody was hollering
or out-of-line or pinch a girl which happens now and then while the girls are
dancing he doesn’t like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You said you remember two specific instances. Could you just
tell us about those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I’ll tell you one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About where they happened and the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I saw one happen, this was outside of the club, this one. Do
you want it in the club or out of the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This was outside of the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Last year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what time last year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would probably say it was sometime last summer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The summer of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I was sitting in the Burgundy Room. You know where the
Burgundy Room is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The Adolphus Hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I was in there having a drink and I was sitting with this
fellow here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who, what fellow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. His name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Don Taber or Tabin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. T-a-b-e-r or T-a-b-i-n?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were with that man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I was with him for a while but he shifted. He saw some girl
and went over to talk to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you were alone at the table?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I was sitting there. I was sitting at another table and I assumed
he come in looking for me to see what I was doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Jack Ruby. Jack don’t like to have me drink. He doesn’t like
to see me getting drunk. He thinks I’m always drunk all the while which I am
not. And as he walked in through the door, this Don Taber was getting pretty
well loaded. He had a few drinks in him, you know, and he has always had a
grudge against Jack for some reason or other, I don’t know what it was, and
Jack was always telling him “Don, I want you to stay away from me” and I
have heard him warn him once before by the club, downstairs from the club.
Well, he used a pretty obscene word with him. I don’t know if you want to take
this down or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On the occasion in the Burgundy Room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; you tell us what happened exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think he told him to go “F” yourself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Go what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Do you want me to use the word?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He told him to go —— himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who told who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Don to Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Told that to Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; he is a type, he is a great guy when he is sober but when
he isn’t he is not easy to get along with you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean when Jack came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Taber or Tabin told him that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And there had been no previous conversation between them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; because he has always picked on Jack for some reason or
other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me get the picture. Jack walks into the room and this man
Taber says “Go —— yourself?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I forgot what Jack says. Jack says something to him. Then
I think there was an answer back or something, I just don’t remember but all I
know is Jack let him have it, hauled off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean he hit him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He hit him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With his fist or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have any knucks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It was his fist, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. So they got into a little battle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack knock him down with that first blow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So they actually squared off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. They squared off. It didn’t last long though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. They stopped it but the other fellow got the worst of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he knocked off his feet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he a big man, this Taber?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He was a little taller than I. I believe he was a little taller than
I. But I would probably say he is a chap about maybe around I would say
between 165 and 170 or 175. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how tall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say he is probably, and I am only guessing, I would
say maybe 5 feet 9 inches or 5 feet 10 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How big a man is Jack by the way in point of height and weight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Jack I think, is about 5 feet 9 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And weighed what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Jack weighed around 185, somewheres around that, 185.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you consider most of that was bone or muscle or did
he have much fat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, he is 52. I don’t care how you drill yourself, I am certain
there is a certain amount of flab that hangs around the side which I didn’t dare
comment on. If I told him that he didn’t like it. But still there is a certain
amount of flab, but he had a powerful back. I mean to look at the man’s back at
his age, he had a tremendous back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he fast with his fists?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say for his age he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you saw this battle with Taber?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, he was pretty fast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he definitely got the best of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the other occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, there was one occasion where he hit somebody I didn’t
catch it with my eye but I happened to be there. I was there and he hit a guy
bigger than him. I don’t remember what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us where that was, in the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, it was in the club. It was in the hallway near the stairs.
But it happened to be I didn’t see it because I happened to be around the side
and all I caught is the tail end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That was in 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he knock the man off his feet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. But I know he got the first lick in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know that? He told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, I heard he always gets the first lick in. He ain’t going to
get hit first if he can help it, if it comes to an argument.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is this the opinion that is generally held?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know if that is the opinion that is generally held or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I am trying to get at is how you got it. Is that your opinion
then that he always gets the first lick in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say so because he is pretty fast for his age.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was the provocation for his hitting the fellow at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think this chap here was getting a little loud. I don’t remember
what the incident was. I think he was making a scene there of some nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Those are the only two occasions that you yourself knew about
from having observed them yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, I have seen him push somebody out without hitting him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you seen that often?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, I don’t say often. I have seen it happen. And when it
has happened, he happened to hold down certain people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever hear him threaten anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Like throwing them down the stairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have heard somebody talk about that. Who did I hear? Oh
yes, I’ll tell you where that was quoted. When I was on the witness stand and
Mr. Alexander asked me that.</p>

<p>The question he asked me, if I can quote him, was that he picked on nothing
but small men who were drunk and women who were drunk and beat them up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your answer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. If I recall right, he sort of hollered at me a bit if I remember
right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Mr. Alexander.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But in any case what is the truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What did I answer him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What you answered I suppose is the truth. What is the truth as
to that question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I’ll tell you how I answered him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, all right; tell us that first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I answered him, I said to Jack Ruby, height has nothing to do
with it, or something to that effect if I remember right. It doesn’t make any
difference if the man is bigger than Jack Ruby because that isn’t going to stop
him. Jack Ruby isn’t afraid of height or size, something like that I answered
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is your opinion now, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you base that opinion on what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In other words, I base this opinion to say, when I was asked this
question on the witness stand, that all he would do would beat up people who
were smaller than he and who were drunk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you think that is not so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I say that he doesn’t go according to size. I mean I know
that he doesn’t fear anybody who is taller than he is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now how do you know that? How do you form that opinion
right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. How do I form that opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Because I think Jack is of that temperament where size don’t
mean anything to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You just base that upon your general knowledge of the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I don’t think he is of the nature who would back off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see him act in what might be considered brutal in
the sense that he went further than he had to go with reference to anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I have never witnessed any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know or have you ever heard of an occasion where he had
a fight with a man who bit part of his finger off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I haven’t seen it. I mean I see the finger. I have heard that,
yes. How it happened I don’t know. There was some sort of a fight and the guy
bit it. Now what happened I don’t know but I’ve heard that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack ever talk to you about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; as a matter of fact I have noticed his finger, you know, I
have seen his finger but I never asked him why, because it happens to be we both
got the same type finger. Mine is a paper cut. His cut much more off than mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He never told you how he lost that part of the finger?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He told me that he lost it, somebody bit his finger in a fight.
Now I don’t know if it was the Silver Spur or wherever it happened. I just
don’t remember where or how it happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever hear about him beating up a taxicab man who came
in to fetch a fare, or to collect a fare?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have never seen it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have heard about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have heard about it. I never heard no names or anything of
that. I heard about it but I have never seen it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now you have expressed to us your opinion that Jack is a man
who was not fearful of anyone irrespective of size. Would you give us your
opinion as to whether or not he was the type of man, from all you know of him,
who would be brutal in a fight? By brutal I mean when he got his man down
he would kick him and be sure he was down, kick him in the groin, in the head
or something of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. I couldn’t answer that. I have never witnessed
anything of this nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you an opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You would ask me guess then and if I guessed I wouldn’t know
what I was guessing at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I would ask you to guess on the same basis that you expressed an
opinion that he was afraid of nobody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He certainly wasn’t afraid of size. In other words, if the man
happened to be 6 inches taller than him he wouldn’t back off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was formed I think you told us from your general
knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is right. He wouldn’t back off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your opinion from your general knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Now when you ask me about kicking and all that, I mean I
don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You know the man and that is all I’m asking. Is he the type of
man who would do that in your opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think so. First of all I don’t think so. Personally, I
don’t think so, but after all I can’t answer for what another individual would
think in his mind. I don’t know, see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We understand this is merely your opinion, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I don’t personally think so. I don’t think he would be
that brutal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You saw him in this fight with Taber or Tabin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, but there was no kicking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to ask you about this. I take it this was not a prolonged
thing. Jack hit him once and that was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no; there were probably six or eight blows swapped.
But I would say Jack got most of the blows in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And this guy swung. What caused Jack to stop? Did somebody
pull him off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; they stopped it. They stopped it and pulled off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This episode at the Carousel that you saw, you say you didn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
actually see any blows thrown at the Carousel. You came in at the tail end of
it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I would say, see, there is an archway; in other words,
it is going up a flight of steps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. And at the flight of steps the doors open and then there is a
walk in, you know, an archway. It is almost like in a closed archway which
is maybe about 20 or 25 steps. Well, around the <b class="sans">L</b> shape of it I didn’t see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Could you tell from where you were how many blows were
thrown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did this last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It didn’t last long because there must have been one or two
blows and that was it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did anybody come in and break that up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know what happened. I just don’t remember what
happened there. I think he knocked him down. I’m not sure. I think he
knocked him down with that blow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack accomplish his purpose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. There was a few people gathered around and the next thing
I think they took him down or something like that. I don’t know. I just don’t
recall what happened on that particular incident but I do know that something
did happen at the time where this fellow I think he was drunk. I really don’t
know if he was. I think he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you ever talked with Jack about what his attitude is
about using his fists?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; this, which I don’t know too much about his youth, it
probably comes from the bringing up of his youth, the poverty that the family
went through. His father was a habitual drunkard, of which I have heard,
and the separations of the family and they lived in a cold water flat and the
only way I’m familiar of something of this nature is what I have seen in
motion pictures of past years of this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want you to tell me now if you think I am wrong. I am going
to suggest this to you and I want to know if this is a fair evaluation.</p>

<p>Would you say from what you know of Jack that the background that he
came from was such that he had the value that one of the ways you solved
problems is in certain kinds of situations you haul off and smack the guy, and
that this is a tool that people use? Now there are some people who in their
daily life wouldn’t hit anybody because they don’t think that is a proper thing.
Would you say that Jack looked at this as a tool that was perfectly acceptable
to use?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. To tell you the truth if I answered it I don’t even know if I
would be answering it correctly. I would probably say maybe in certain aspects
yes and maybe others no. I really couldn’t answer correctly. I couldn’t give
you a truthful answer on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why is that that you couldn’t give an answer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Because I couldn’t, because I can’t think for what the man
thinks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don’t know that much about him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To be able to say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. I would probably say maybe in certain instances
it may happen. Maybe in others it wouldn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask it this way. Knowing Jack Ruby, would you
say that there are situations where Jack would haul off and hit a guy, not because
he was emotionally concerned but because he felt this was the way to solve the
problem at that particular point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t think so. I don’t think so. I would probably say
that he would have to be beefed up pretty good about something before he hit
somebody. I would probably say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that the case with the man at the Carousel?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Apparently the man, which I never saw, apparently he must
have done something wrong. I don’t know what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But this wasn’t something where he built up a head of steam
on this guy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Maybe this is something that just went off instantaneously.
Maybe the guy said something to him which I didn’t know. Maybe he called
him a curse word, you know. I don’t know what it could have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have indicated along here in your testimony, particularly
in answer to a question of a little while ago, that he had a fast temper. I
think you said he was a man of temper. I think that was your phrase?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Agree.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you snapped your fingers and said he would just go like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He could have a pretty fast temper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now that must be based, that is to say your impression must
be based upon episodes when you witnessed him <span class="locked">losing——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I witnessed him on me, but not hitting me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us <span class="locked">about——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Hollered at me, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about some of the episodes that you saw concerning
yourself or others which indicated to you that he had a fast temper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, if there should have been discussion about something,
whatever it might be, with me he would make wrong and holler at me and
flare up at me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you mean by “make wrong”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I could never be right with the man, see what I mean? I
couldn’t be right. In other words, if I said black was black he would say no
it is white and that is it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he would do that in a gruff fashion do you think?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. With me? Oh my, you have no idea how many times he has
hollered at me but he’d never lay a hand on me. And the funny thing is that
is how fast he got over it, and he’d forget about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You snapped your fingers again? You mean that he <span class="locked">would——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In other words, when I snapped my fingers I meant he would
get over it that fast from me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, from your own experience there have been innumerable
occasions where he would react toward you in such a way that you would
describe it as anger, <span class="locked">manifested——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Wait a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You would think he was going to hit me but I knew he wouldn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This anger being manifested by a loud tone and certain gestures
which would indicate he was going to hit you, but didn’t, and that you have
seen many times, and you also tell us <span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have seen it on myself at certain times. Many times with
others, but whatever the thing might be, I mean I don’t know. Like I told you
before, if somebody come up there and pinched a stripper or something like
that, which has happened, man, this would throw him off. He didn’t like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you say he would calm down right away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He would calm down right away. And he would warn them
“Again, out” and he would put them out. There wouldn’t be any hesitation.
He protected his girls up there, this I’ll tell you, at all times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I want to explore another aspect of this that you have mentioned,
and that is that as quickly as he flared up he seemed to flare down, if you
want me to put it that way, calm down. Can you give us examples of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I can give you examples of myself on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean that following one of these flareups that you have
described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, he would holler at me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then it would be all over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He would holler at me and raise the roof at me and then he
would tone down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long would it take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. A matter of a minute or two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, he wouldn’t brood over it. Having gotten mad
at you he wouldn’t be a brooder. He would change to another subject and
be quite his normal self again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. See I couldn’t make this man wrong. I can’t make him
wrong, you know. I’m the wrong one. I refer to myself, mind you. Whatever
it might be I can’t be right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was the way he treated you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To stay in this same general area here, did you know that
Jack owned a pair of knuckles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember when he bought them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I would probably say that he probably had them before
I was ever close to him. I am only guessing. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you learn that he had them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I saw them in a cloth sack once. He carried them in a cloth
sack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did he keep that sack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No particular place. The one time I saw it, it was home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he keep anything else in the sack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Of course, he had a gun which everybody knows. You see,
Jack’s bank account was his pockets, not the bank but his pockets. That is
where his bank was. And he always carried various sums of money, which
could be $1,500, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, whatever it might be, in all different
pockets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now before we explore that area further, I want to get a few
generalities concerning Jack. What were his drinking habits? You shake
your head. What does that mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He is not a drinker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He didn’t drink at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He didn’t drink at all, or very little?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I wouldn’t say at all but I would probably say if he took a half
dozen drinks a year he took a lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How about smoking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No smoking whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was his attitude toward women?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Like any other man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say any other normal man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Any other normal man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever observed any traits which suggested to you the
possibility of homosexuality?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On his part?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have any peculiar mannerisms which might have suggested
such a thing to other people, even though it was not so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I never noticed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he lisp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. So do I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Jack has a lisp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He has a lisp. He has always had it to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In your opinion he was not homosexual at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. Just as normal as any human being.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was single.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He has got a brother older than he is and single, never been
married, Hyman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have any girl friends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; he went out with various girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I am getting at is what you know about his sex relationships.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. His sex relationship, you know I’m not there to watch wherever
he may be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Still you may have some knowledge of facts which would throw
light upon that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He likes women.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. How do I know he likes women?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I like women.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ever tell you that he liked them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Did he ever tell me? In any normal conversation I’m certain
anybody here, who doesn’t say they don’t like women. I think this is a normal
thing to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I am trying to get at is simply this. Very naturally as
you pointed out a moment ago, it is very rare that there are any eyewitnesses
to acts of sexual intercourse. On the other hand, there are other facts and circumstances
from which one may judge if a man is having sexual intercourse
with a particular woman, and that is what I am trying to get at. Do you know
of any such things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This here I’m never around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You mean when he is having sexual intercourse with a woman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; of course you wouldn’t be around, but do you have any
opinion as to whether or not he was having any affairs of a sexual nature with
anybody? If you are reticent about naming names, perhaps we can leave that
off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have no names to name, but I am certain that he likes women.
I know he talks to them like I talk to them or anybody else talks to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ever bring any to the apartment that you know of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am certain he has had them up for coffee when I have been
there, such as that or a drink or talk, conversation. He has had even the help
up there, you know. Once in a while we have a party. This is when I turn out
to be the cook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you can’t tell us then of any particular person that you
would think Jack had intimate relationships with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know of any at all that you could even suggest in your
own mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have seen him talking to many girls but if anything of that
nature I am not around where he don’t want me around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ever ask you to leave, for example, because he was
having some feminine company, or indicate that he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. On rare occasions he has said he was going to have some company
or somebody over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he indicated that he wanted you to leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. On rare occasions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the sort of thing I am talking about that would indicate
some factual situations upon which you can base your opinion. That is what I
was speaking of a moment ago when I asked you for facts and circumstances that
would throw light on your opinion, recognizing fully that normally one never
actually is an eyewitness to such a thing. Do you have any other types of
episodes or evidence of that nature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was his relationship do you think with the girls at his
club, I mean the waitresses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The girls in his club? Strictly business, strictly business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you say that if a person said that Jack was on the make
for every one of the girls that worked for him it would be a wrong statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have heard that expressed many a time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you think about that statement?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It definitely is a wrong statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never saw it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Now what their conversations may be, you know, after all, he
has talked to all the girls in the club at one time or another. What the conversations
are I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you never saw anything that would indicate to you in any
way, or heard anything by him that would lead you to the conclusion that his
relationship with any of the girls was of an intimate character?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; if it was, I didn’t know about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about Jack’s attitude about what his girls did in the nature
of sexual intimacies with other people than himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The girls working in the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You refer to the strippers or the cocktail waitresses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I refer to both, and if there is a difference between them then
I would ask you to explain the difference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, if there was any and he heard about it, I am certain he
would probably yank him out. He didn’t go for that bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Something must have happened that leads you to that opinion.
What is it that leads you to that opinion that he would certainly have done
something about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have heard him mention that he doesn’t want anybody outside
using any of his girls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You yourself have heard him say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; he don’t want any of his girls going out with customers.
He didn’t want the place to have a reputation such as that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he carry that policy to the point of supervising the personal
lives of his strippers and waitresses beyond the area of relations with people
who were in the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Beyond the area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you mentioned a moment ago that he didn’t want
any girls to have any dates or anything with any patrons of the club or
customers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now my next question is did he extend that policy of supervision
of what his girls did to their personal relations with people who were not
patrons of the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That I don’t know. I don’t know about that. I don’t know.
First of all there can never be controllability of that. After all, where they are,
that is their business, wherever they are, whether it is day or night. This I
can’t even answer you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was Jack sensitive about his religion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us how you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, he didn’t like the M.C.’s having any jokes about the
Jewish race, things of that nature. Now I have heard him say so to a couple of
M.C.’s already.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ever talk to you personally about it, say anything to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; not particularly. I mean it has always been in the open.
I have even heard him say it right in the club. He don’t want any Jewish jokes.
He was sensitive this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think he was overly sensitive on the subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, I don’t know, overly sensitive, but he was sensitive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is he more sensitive than other Jews that you have known?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say he is; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With reference to his religion, did he practice it actively?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. As far as going to church, synagogue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He went to church; he went to synagogue on holidays.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is, Jewish holidays?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, yes; always.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He wasn’t one who went regularly then to synagogue?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This I don’t know. I would have to leave this question because
I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you lived with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. During the time that you lived with him did he ever indicate
or did you gather that he was a regular churchgoer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. They go on Friday nights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever see any pattern of his going on Friday nights
regularly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, I have never seen a pattern of it. Now I don’t say that
he has or hasn’t been. Maybe he has at certain times and probably not on other
times. I don’t say this is every Friday night that he goes, no. I wouldn’t say
that. But he does make, you know, the important holidays.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you consider him to be a religious man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know how, to tell you the truth, I don’t know how to break
it down for you, how religious he is. Now we never went into an aspect to talk
about just how religious he is. All I can say is that he observes as to holidays.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He never told you anything which would indicate that he was
either religious or not religious.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. Well, I think he fasts on a certain type holiday. He fasts,
for this kind of fast it is really something, but he does observe those things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean not the regular Saturday fast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. This is the one time of the year you fast. You don’t
eat anything for 24 hours. I know he does that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think it is a good time for recess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask one question here. Does he belong to any lay organizations
connected with any of the synagogues in town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know if he belonged to them or not. This I can’t know.
But I think he went—it was Temple Emanuel. I don’t know which one he went
to. I think it was Temple Emanuel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To your knowledge, do you have any knowledge of his ever
participating in any activities, Jewish activities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. B’nai B’rith?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would probably say maybe in donations or something like
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Other than giving money he didn’t belong to the synagogue’s
men’s clubs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Supposing we take a recess now until 2 o’clock.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:35 p.m., the proceeding recessed.)</p>

<h3>TESTIMONY OF GEORGE SENATOR RESUMED</h3>

<p>(The proceeding reconvened at 2 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Senator, we are now continuing the deposition which we
began this morning. I am sure you understand and I want the record to show
that this deposition is being continued under the same authority and under the
same conditions as it began this morning, and also that you are under the same
oath. Now there are a few more general areas that I would like to talk to
you about concerning the character of Jack Ruby and the type of man he was.
Let me direct your attention to the political beliefs and thinking of Jack Ruby,
and ask you what comment you have to make about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. None whatsoever on his beliefs on political issues.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you mean by that that you don’t know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Break down when you say political issues.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean do you know anything about what his thinking was from
what he told you concerning his beliefs about politics in general?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he was not of the nature, he never went into anything of
that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever hear him discuss international politics?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he seem to show any interest in international affairs as they
were developing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean would he be the type of person that would read the
newspapers at all? Did he read newspapers at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, sure; he read newspapers religiously every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he read all of them, I mean every part of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I will tell you, when you ask me that, I tell you where his reading
is. On the toilet bowl. That is where all his reading is—is on the toilet bowl.
It may sound funny, but it is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you give us any idea from what you know, of what his
reaction to international events was, such as, for instance, the Cuban crisis in
1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He never discussed these.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are familiar with what I am talking about? I think it was
in the fall of 1962 when we discovered that Cuba had some possible atomic
weapons over there, a subject of national interest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I have read that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the Berlin crisis of the year before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the sort of thing I mean. Did he comment about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it your thought that he just had no interest in that sort of
thing at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, if he did or not, he never discussed it too much. He would
read a paper. He would read his ad. He reads these—of course, I am certain
he reads all parts of the paper, but especially the entertainment part, he was
very anxious in reading.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Normally when two people share space such as you do, and are
in each other’s company and have any conversation at all, the conversation
normally relates to the topics of the day, as it were, as reflected by newspapers
and other news media.</p>

<p>I wonder if you can throw any light on what his attitude was or his interest
was towards topics of the day of international import.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I just don’t recall. All I know is that he reads the—of course,
I am certain he reads all of the paper, you know, or various parts, but he would
talk about show business a lot with me, see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever hear him discuss at all any international incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I just can’t think offhand. I don’t say he did or didn’t. I just
can’t think offhand if he did or didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever seek to engage him in small talk, shall we say,
about subjects of that nature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, he talked about the President. I remember once we were
watching a picture of President Kennedy’s kid going between the desk. He
thought that was so wonderful, you know, enjoyed over that. I remember that
distinctly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean he saw that on TV?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; this he marveled over. But the discussion, we never
went into papers too much. He was mainly, I know when he grabbed the paper
the first thing he would go to is the show part of it, his competitors, the show
part of it, the night life, Tony Zoppi, with a nightclub. He is like, I don’t
know how to compare him, to somebody who writes a column in New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t recall in all of the years you have known Jack of his
being interested in international affairs to the point that you can remember
any discussion with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I really can’t think offhand. I don’t say that he probably
hadn’t, but I just don’t think offhand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t remember any such discussions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t; no.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now what would be your impression, knowing Jack as a whole,
of his interest in international affairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The reason I asked you that, although I realize it is an opinion
question, is because you have been able to give us your opinion on other aspects
of his life and character, for instance, that he was a man who was not a homosexual,
and so forth, and you based your opinions upon your experience with
him, and this is just another aspect of his character, that is all.</p>

<p>Now I am simply asking you what is your opinion about his interest in communism
or rightism or leftism or middle-of-the-roadism or any kind of ism.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The only way I can refer to anything of that nature is the time
we saw the billboards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean that <span class="locked">was——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The impeachment <span class="locked">of——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After the President <span class="locked">was——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Right; this was the time that I <span class="locked">saw——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We will get to that, but are you willing to say now, as far as you
can remember, that that is the only time you ever saw him interested in a
matter of that nature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You see, when he gets home at night, the first thing he heads
for is the bathroom, and the paper goes with him, and from there on he sits
there, I don’t know, 45 minutes reading the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I appreciate your comment because it throws some light on it,
but I would like to have an answer if you can give it to me to that question. I
don’t know if I can rephrase it.</p>

<p>(The previous question was read by the reporter.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you answer that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I didn’t get that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s see if I can rephrase it. You mentioned that you saw him
interested in a matter that concerned an ism. I had previously asked you
whether or not he had, to your knowledge, any interest in rightism, communism,
leftism, middle-of-the-roadism, and you mentioned that one incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Those, none whatsoever, because he is a lover of the country he
lives in. He was <span class="locked">never——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I suppose that would be called Americanism.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Americanism. He loves the nation he is in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You formed that opinion, of course, on certain events or things
that he told you. Can you refer to what those things would have been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I can’t, but I know that he has never belonged to any
organizations. He has never attended any meetings to my knowledge, and
this is the only way that I can in all reality base it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say that he is a lover of his country. Now, did he say
so or did he act in certain ways regarding certain instances that caused you to
form that opinion?</p>

<p>You see what I mean, any impression that you have about anybody is based
upon your reactions to things said or done, and that is all I am asking you
to say.</p>

<p>Now you say he is a man who loves his country. I ask you, did you hear
him say so or did you get that impression from things he did, or attitudes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I just take this for granted that he does, the same way as I
take it that I know that I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, you know you do from your own experience, but on
the other hand you don’t know about somebody else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know how to base it with him. I know he is very fond
of the city he lived in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how do you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Because he has told me he likes Dallas. He likes Dallas, he
likes everything about it. He liked living there. He liked it because there
wasn’t any hustle and bustle like any large, big city like New York or Chicago
or California.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you similar facts or experiences upon which to base
your opinion that he is a lover of the United States as such?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I can’t base it on anything. It is only what I think. And, of
course, to my way of thinking I think everybody does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think I am beginning to see what you mean. You assume
that everybody loves their country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Unless there is something to the contrary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to ask some questions along that line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Go ahead and do it now unless you prefer to wait.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; I would just as soon, when you finish with an area, pick
up from notes I have been making.</p>

<p>Did Jack Ruby, George, to your knowledge show any interest in any political
candidates for local office in Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know on that. I will tell you, as far as I know of him,
he has never spoken of or never messed around with anything like that, political-wise
or anything of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever see him with any campaign literature for anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I haven’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever see him with any literature of any political sort
that would be other than newspaper literature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You know in Texas and elsewhere there are all sorts of organizations
that are putting out literature, the John Birch Society and Civil
Liberties Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He never messed around with that. The only first showing
I ever seen of any nature was that night he woke me up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You mentioned that Jack read newspapers, and you thought
every day. Did you have a newspaper delivered to your apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he bought it on the way home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he read newspapers from outside of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he bought the morning paper and the evening paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he buy the Fort Worth papers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; and Fort Worth, come to think of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Any particular reason why he should buy a Fort Worth paper
rather than a Dallas paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; because he bought them both. No particular reason, but
he would buy them both for news or see what is going on in Fort Worth, I
assume.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He would buy a Fort Worth paper at a Dallas newsstand or
would he only buy the Fort Worth newspaper when he went to Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he would buy a Fort Worth paper, I will tell you where he
bought it, he bought it at the Adolphus Hotel. He always picked his paper
up at the stand in front of the Adolphus. He would buy the morning news.
As a matter of fact, he would buy any paper that was laying around there that
the man had in front of the stand there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he read the Wall Street Journal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t even think he could understand it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about magazines? Did he subscribe to any magazines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Time magazine, Newsweek?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I never seen any magazines come in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any magazines around the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; the only magazines I ever bought was Reader’s Digest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you people have a television set at your apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you have a radio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Jack accustomed to being at home and watching the TV
or listening to the radio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. On the TV part; yes, he would put that on. He would have
that on, and, of course, there is two things I know interested him on TV.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What were those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Those were Westerns and the stories, you know, whatever
stories there might be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You mean the movies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; the movies, and he liked the Westerns, you know, the
half-hour or hour programs, whatever they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have a radio in his car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He had, what do you call those little things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Transistor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; transistor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have one that was installed in the car itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You mean put in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He had it put in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. A car radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh yes; installed with the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this any sort of special kind of radio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; just a radio that came with the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It wasn’t equipped to receive any kind of frequencies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. FM or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. As a matter of fact, the last car he bought he bought
second-hand, which he thought he had a good buy on, and he bought it, and, of
course, the thing had a radio in it, you know, whatever make it was. Nothing
special about, just the ordinary car radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about your radio at home? Could that pick up FM?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or shortwave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know if it could or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of a radio was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t even know the make or the brand. One side there was
a clock and the other side was a radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it then your conclusion about Jack Ruby would be that
he didn’t have any particular political feelings one way or another, and he
wasn’t a great patriot and he wasn’t disloyal. As far as you knew he was just
an ordinary American citizen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He was a good, sound American citizen, and politics, he never
messed around with that. He never messed around politically at all. The
majority was connected with the music industry, the night life, you know, his
club, his competitors, what they were doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Coming back to the automobile and the <span class="locked">radio——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Pardon me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Concerning the radio in the automobile, what was his custom
about putting it on when he was riding? Was it his custom to put it on or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, not. He normally didn’t put it on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Normally he would not put it on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Normally he wouldn’t have it on. He also had one of the little
transistors, one of these transistors that he had. The reason he had this transistor,
of course he had it before I was around, the car he had before then, the
radio didn’t work, so he had the transistor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did he keep it, in the automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; he laid it on the seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he play it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; he put on the music.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that was his custom when he was driving around, instead of
turning on the radio in the automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I wouldn’t say at all times. Certain times he would put it on
and play the music.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He would play the transistor?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. That was on the car he had when the radio, the car
radio was not working.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was Ruby’s habit so far as you know concerning his
finances, and his banking and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. As far as I know about it, his bank was his pockets. Now, if
he had any banking, I don’t know what he had in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you observe then that he carried large sums of money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh yes; always. Everybody knew that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, how did he carry it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In ready cash.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But I mean did he roll it up and put it in his pocket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Rolled it up or have a string around it, not a string, you know,
one of these rubber bands around it. He would carry some here and he would
carry some here, and some here, and some in his back pocket. I don’t think
he knew where he had it half the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let the record show that when the witness was saying “here,
here and here,” he was pointing to various pockets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This is the way. As a matter of fact, he used to say to me
“George, where is my money,” because he can’t remember where he put his
money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now you were with him frequently when he closed up the Carousel
at night and you would go home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How was the money handled then, that is the receipts of that
night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In his pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We have heard something about a canvas bag, a money bag.
Did you ever see that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I don’t know what he would have in the bag. You know
when it comes to money, that is his business. It doesn’t get that close to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; we are just asking you what you observed, that is all, about
his handling of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He has had money in the bag, and he has had it in his pockets.
Now I don’t know what the separation could be unless he has got a certain
amount of money for bills or what it is I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When he had money in the bag where did he leave the bag?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The bag? In the trunk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In the trunk of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. While going home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, when you would come out of the Carousel he
would take his bag up, and it had money in it, and bring it and throw it in the
trunk of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Right. He would get home, open the trunk, take the bag up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, do you know anything about a gun that he had, a pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what you know about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I know he had a pistol, one of the small ones. In the nature of
his type business, carrying all this money, this cash with him, this is why he
always had the gun with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he keep the gun on his body?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. At times he had it on his body and at times he had it in his
pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he own a holster for the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Either a shoulder holster or a hip holster?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I have never seen it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So when he carried a gun on his person where would he keep it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It would be in his pants pocket or sometimes it may be in the bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know anything, from talking to him or otherwise, about
the ownership of the Vegas Club? Who owned the Vegas, in other words, as
far as you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. As far as I know Jack Ruby owned it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Am I correct in assuming that your opinion on that point is from
what he told you, or did he say anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I always understood that he owned it, I mean as far as I know.
Of course, there is a lot of things that I don’t know that he never told me, you
know. He doesn’t expose everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Eva Grant was actually the operator of it, wasn’t she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; but Eva always felt like she was the owner. This is a
sister. Of course, she had it and managed it for quite a while. I don’t know
how long she managed it, has been at the Vegas Club, because it was before me
even, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On what do you base that opinion that she thought that she
really was the owner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Because I assumed that Jack was a brother and she felt it was
like hers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You see what I am trying to get at is whether or not there are any
statements or incidents that occurred which led you to the opinion that she
thought she owned the Vegas. Do you see what I mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The only way I could express that is Jack used to say to me that
“Eva thinks she owns the club,” because she has been staying there so long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do they get along?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. They are both of the same nature, like cats and dogs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I take it from that you mean they used to fight a lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; because as well as Jack would holler, let me assure you
she can holler too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you have been a witness to some of those instances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. As a matter of fact, the further away the better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t quite understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. For me the further away the better. In other words, I shied
away from all that. I didn’t want to listen to that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What you are saying <span class="locked">is——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am not happy over the fights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. My question is how frequently it happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. How frequent I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you were a witness to some, I take it, and when it began you
would want to get away, is that the idea?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I tell you where I heard most of it, I mean what I can
recollect is when around the telephone. Of course, I can’t hear her, but I can
hear him shouting, so apparently I know there is something that is flickering.</p>

<p>He is hollering at her about something, or she is hollering at him about something.
See, she is hard to get along with, with the employees of the Vegas Club.
She is just hard to work for. All I know is I never want to work for her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the ownership of the Sovereign and the Carousel?
Do you know anything about that, who owned that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The Sovereign, he has some partner. I don’t remember who his
partner was. Of course, this is all before I got that close, but he had a partner
in the Sovereign Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Joe Slayton was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is it, Joe Slayton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course, Slayton ultimately got out of it, didn’t he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it your impression that Jack owned the Sovereign entirely?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; Joe Slayton was a part owner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean after Slayton left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know about that. That is a little before me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about Ralph Paul? Did he have any part in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Ralph Paul had a part in it. I don’t know what the breakdown
was, but I know Ralph Paul was connected with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Connected by way of ownership?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I believe he was connected by ownership. I mean if he owned
half or what it was I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On what facts do you base that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. On guesswork. I know he had something to do with it. What
part he owned I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What facts make you state that you know he had something
to do with it? There must be something that occurred again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Nothing occurred because I mean I have seen Ralph, I know
Ralph, and I know there is the association of him having a part of that club
somehow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me put it to you this way. Did Jack ever tell you that
Ralph Paul owned part of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not directly, but I knew. You know as well as I know Jack,
there was an awful lot of things he didn’t tell me circularwise. You can say
moneywise where he kept his money, if he had a bank account, I know he had a
connection with Ralph Paul. How much Ralph owned I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Paul ever tell you anything about his interest or ownership?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; the first time he mentioned it to me, and, of course, this is
after this whole deal happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He said once that he had a part of that place there. He was
part owner of that place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember when he told you that, and where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He told me at the Carousel, but I don’t remember when.
I mean I can’t specifically remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Isn’t it a fact that he took over the management right away, as
soon as Jack was in jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, he did. Now, I don’t know how much he owned or how
much Jack owned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he indicate to you that it was an ownership interest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, there was, but how much I don’t know. In other words, I
don’t know who owned the bigger piece or if it was equal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think that only the two of them had an interest in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. To my knowledge. I don’t know of anybody else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever hear of his brother Earl having a possible interest
in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Earl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Sure. The first time I met Earl is, of course, when all this
happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t know him before that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Never seen him before in my life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about Sam?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Sam? I knew Sam. I have never seen him that often. Of
course, I met Sam at the Vegas Club. Sam at one time worked there with Eva,
and they couldn’t get along, so Sam was out, fighting like cats and dogs. Eva is
just a hard girl to work for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was Jack Ruby’s attitude toward the police as a group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, all I know is apparently he must like them. They always
used to come to see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about those who came to see him. Do you know who
they were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I knew a lot of them by face. I didn’t know them all by name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they come frequently?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Various ones, yes, every day. I don’t say it is the same ones,
whoever was coming in, but they would either be plain clothes or police in
uniforms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they come to inspect or to enjoy the club as a place of
entertainment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, they came to inspect, to my knowledge I would say they
came to inspect, but Jack always offered them a coffee, asked them if they
wanted coffee, a Seven-Up or a Coke.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Wasn’t it a rule in fact that they could get such little items as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
coffee and Cokes and Seven-Ups and soft drinks without cost? He gave them
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; that was the nature of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the arrangement about the entrance fee? They didn’t
pay that, if they came socially?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have been on the door yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any instructions on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, they didn’t pay entry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they pay for drinks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. They had a special rate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think 40 cents, or anybody that was a friend of his—in other
words, for an example, your taxi drivers, the taxi drivers used to bring customers.
In other words, an out-of-towner would say “where can you go,” they would
say the Carousel or the Colony or wherever they may bring them.</p>

<p>So they brought them up there, in other words, if they were off duty and
wanted to come up, they were guests of Jack’s, and they paid a special price
for drinks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And they didn’t pay the admission charge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. Now the fellows who worked downstairs in the garage,
they were allowed in, but at a special price. The special price was no different
for anybody. It was all one price, the special.</p>

<p>In other words, they gave them a discount on beer or the setups, whichever
they were having, and your hotel bellcaps and things in that area, he always
let them in free.</p>

<p>I mean he was good to these type people, you know, and, of course, these weren’t
people of tremendous means or of that nature, and everyone had a cut price,
he always gave them a discount on the drinks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to go back a bit. Talking about the ownership of the
Vegas Club and the Carousel Club, did Jack rent the premises of the Vegas
Club or did he own part of that building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, I think he rented it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He rented it, so when you talk about ownership of that operation
out <span class="locked">there——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not owning the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are not talking about any real estate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He did have some physical assets out there I suppose? He had
tables and chairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And a piano maybe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So, that is what you are talking about when you talk about
ownership?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. In other words, ownership, I refer to the merchandise or
the things in the place, not only the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the right to get the profits if there were any? Did
he get the profits off the Vegas Club or did Eva Grant get the profits, or did they
share it in some way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This part I don’t know. All I know is the money was handled
by Eva, and which way the money ever swung was left out of my—wasn’t any
of my business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Jack had a practice at the Carousel, and correct me if I am
wrong about this, that at the end of every night, he would take that night’s
receipts and he would take them down to his car, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Either that or put them in his pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or put them in his pocket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, whichever he saw fit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now what would he do once he got that money in his pocket
or in the car? What would he do with it, take it back to the apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What would he do with it in the apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Just leave it in his pants or whatever it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have a safe back in the apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have a safe at the Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he visit the Vegas Club every night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. He would probably say he would visit the Vegas Club—you
know, for a while they were running this amateur hour every Friday, and
Jack would go after he closed the Carousel, he would go over to the Vegas
because the Vegas would stay open one hour later.</p>

<p>I don’t know how to describe it. They were able to stay open until 3 o’clock
in the morning, and they would have a little bit of entertainment from 2 to 3,
and Jack would sort of MC it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you say Jack wouldn’t go there every night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how many nights a week would he go to the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would probably say, of course, I can’t always say, I don’t
always see him all the time, you know, and I am not with him all the time, but
I would probably say it was more so weekends. Now, during the week I don’t
say that he probably hasn’t jumped over there, because if he has I don’t even
know, because when he does go out he doesn’t tell me his moves where he
is going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you were living with Jack at the Carousel Club in that
period of time, how long was that that you lived at the Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know how long he lived there before me. I don’t know
how long he lived there previous to when I came, but I wasn’t there too long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you there a week or 2 weeks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It might be. I just don’t remember how long it could be. It
might have been 2 weeks. It might have been 3 weeks, I don’t know. It
might be that long. Mind you, I want you to know this is guesswork. I am
only guessing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it your impression that during the week on 5-day weeks
that maybe 3 or 4 nights out of a week he would not go to the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am saying that he wouldn’t go to the Vegas Club. There
would be 3 or 4 nights out of the week that he would not go to the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, yes; I would probably say that, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what was done with the money over at the Vegas Club
every night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know, that part I don’t know. I am not familiar with
that part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever see Jack take any money from the Vegas Club
and bring it back to the apartment or put it in his car or in his pockets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; not out of the Vegas. I don’t know if it has been done, but
I haven’t witnessed it. The money is handled, at the Vegas the money is
handled by Eva. Now, how she disburses it or banks it I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know of any bank accounts that Jack maintained?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He had one bank. What he had in it I don’t know. I am
trying to think of the name of the bank. Do you have a listing of the banks
he has? Can you refresh my memory on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I can give you a list of banks and read off some names. Tell
me if any of these are familiar to you. How about the Park Cities Bank and
Trust Company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the National Bank of Commerce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The American Bank and Trust Company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The Mercantile National Bank?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; see, if you can find one on—continue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, the Industrial National Bank.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Merchants. Have you got Merchants? That is the one I am
thinking of. I think he had a bank account at the Merchants.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But not the Mercantile National Bank?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. If he did I didn’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are there two different banks, one the Merchants and the other
the Mercantile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the South Oak Cliff State Bank?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. If he did I didn’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you only heard of one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I heard of the Merchants.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear him discuss what was done with the receipts
from the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear Eva Grant mention that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; but I will tell you what I assumed. I assumed the money
was paid, what money was taken in, I assumed that the employees were paid
off, the band was paid off, the gas and electric and the rent would come out of
that. This is what I assumed, or whatever incidentals there might be. Now,
the disposal otherwise I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then the fact is that you don’t really know how the funds at
the Vegas were handled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or what part Jack got of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now let’s move to the period of the week of the assassination of
the President Can you tell us first of all where you were when you heard
of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I was in a bar having a liquid lunch. I was uptown. I was
in a bar and had a couple of beers for lunch instead of eating lunch, and some
chap walked in, who I don’t know, and he drove up with his car and he had
the radio on, and as he walked in he said, “The President was shot.” And I
hollered “You’re kidding.” He says, “No; I am not kidding.” So we got outside,
and this is all going on on this car radio we listened to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was in downtown Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I was uptown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you seen the Presidential parade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I didn’t see it at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whether Jack planned to see the parade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he comment about the President’s visit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You see, let me jump a little ahead of that. That morning, you
see, of course, which is a working day for me, I am up much earlier than he is,
and he was sleeping when I left that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him the night before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; the night before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you discussed the visit of the President, his coming the
next day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. We talked about that. We talked about the President was
coming in, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the nature of his comment concerning this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t mean the words, but the ideas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, we were happy that he was coming.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Jack was too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; coming into Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack tell you why he felt happy about it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No: I just don’t remember if he did relate that or not, but we
thought it was a great honor for him to come to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he think his coming would help business in Dallas generally,
and his business in particular?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; there was no comment on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he state whether or not he was going to try to see the parade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he didn’t mention that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you have previously said in a statement that you saw
him sometime that night, and he went out or something, and then, you went
to bed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. The next time that I saw him was the following morning
when he woke me up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am talking about the night now of the 21st, before the President
was shot, Thursday night, you all talked about the President’s coming. Did
he go out or stay at home, do you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he is at the club. He goes to the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He is at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You went to bed, and when he came in I assume you were
sleeping.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You are talking about Thursday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, I am talking about Thursday night and Friday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Thursday night—the President came in Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; but Thursday night did Jack follow his usual routine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; his usual routine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were asleep I guess when he got back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Thursday night I don’t remember if I was or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Anyhow, Friday morning when you got up he was asleep.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you didn’t talk to him until you heard of the death of the
President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; the next time that I talked to him was Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t speak to him at all on Friday afternoon after the
death?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I never saw him at all. I was out. I was out all day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go home on Friday night at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Friday night I must have went home around somewheres between
10 and 11. Of course, I bought the paper at the Adolphus before I went home.
I always buy a paper, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was Jack home then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He had not attempted to contact you from the time of the
President’s death at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. He couldn’t contact me because I was around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you try to contact him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you bring out where it was that he was around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. When I said “around”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Around town, no particular place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you going from bar to bar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, not bar to bar. I had been at a couple of bars. I was
with a friend of mine that night, and we went out, we had a couple of beers
and we were so disgusted, if you can picture the overall picture of Friday
night in the city of Dallas after the occurrence, what happened that afternoon
or late that morning, the city was, I don’t know how to describe it, morguelike.
They were brooding. Everybody was brooding, a sad affair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course you don’t know whether Jack went to the apartment
on Friday night before you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you went home and went to bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I read the paper in bed, and that is when I saw the why’s
about the President. They had a list, “Why, Mr. President?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A full-page ad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; “Why, Mr. President,” so and so, “Why are you here?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The one signed by Bernard Weissman? W-e-i-s-s-m-a-n.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You saw that before you saw Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. As a matter of fact, I read the paper in bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You went to sleep, I take it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The next thing I know somebody was hollering at me, and
shaking me up. This was around 3 o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now describe him to us at that time. What was his condition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He was excited. He was moody; and the first thing come out
of his mouth is the incident. Of course, the incident what happened to President
Kennedy, and he said, “Gee, his poor children and Mrs. Kennedy, what a
terrible thing to happen.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had he been drinking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Jack don’t drink.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He wasn’t drinking on this occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he don’t drink, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And his remarks were concerning the children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The children and Mrs. Kennedy and how sorry he felt for them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What other comments did he make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Then he brought up the situation where he saw this poster of
Justice of the Peace Earl Warren, impeach him. Earl Warren.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He said he had seen that poster?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; he had saw that poster.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say when he had noticed it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I think he noticed it that day or sometime that day, I
assume. I am not sure, but I think it was that day, and I assume that when
something goes into his brain he wants to follow it up and find out why, why
that poster was up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you had some experiences like that before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But I mean you said some experiences where he got something
in his mind and he wanted to find out why, and he followed it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. I can’t relate any, but I assume these things
could happen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you had never had any experience of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I haven’t had any experience.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So, this was a new experience for you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; and he made me get dressed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he tell you when he made you get dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He was telling me about this sign here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why did he want you to get dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He wanted me to go down to see the sign, and meanwhile he
had called. He had a kid sleeping in the club who helps around, and he has
got a Polaroid camera. So he calls the kid up, wakes him up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear that call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear that call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yeah, he calls him up and says, “Larry, get up, get dressed,”
something of that nature, “and get that Polaroid with the flashbulbs and meet
me downstairs. I’ll be right downtown.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was after he told you to get dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; after he told me first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he at that time comment upon or notice the Weissman ad
that you had been reading the night before, the big ad that you commented upon,
“Why, Mr. President,” I think it was called?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember he noticed it there or he noticed it after the
incident. Now, if he seen it before I just don’t remember, but I know after we
got through this incident, which I will relate to you, we were looking at this ad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was at the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, no; this was—I saw it myself originally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In the newspapers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had the newspaper on your bed. You had gone to sleep
reading?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. I probably threw it on the floor. I think I threw it on
the floor before I went to bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case you have no recollection that you discussed the ad
prior to leaving the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I just don’t remember if I did or not, but I do know that we
did look at that ad that night at another place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We will get to that. What happened next then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, I got dressed, went downstairs, got in the car. I got
dressed. We went downtown. We picked up Larry. He drove over to where
this billboard was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had he told you where it was beforehand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; he told me it was on the corner of Hall and the expressway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which expressway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. North Central Expressway. I had an indication because I
sort of knew the location of the area. I know where Hall Street is and I know
where the expressway is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Go ahead. Just pick up as to what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. So we went downtown and picked up Larry. From there we
drove over to where this billboard was, and he had the kid take three Polaroid
shots of this billboard. Now, what his intentions were with these I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He didn’t express any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he didn’t say what he was going to do with them but he
wanted three shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ask him or did anyone else ask him why he wanted to
take pictures of this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; all he said to me, “I can’t understand why they want to
impeach Earl Warren.” He said, “This must be the work of the John Birch
Society or the Communist Party.” And he wanted to know why.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say how taking a picture would help him to find out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he didn’t. He didn’t say how that would help him to find
out. So from there we went down to the post office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Larry go with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To the post office, I mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do at the post office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Wait now, we went down to the post area. This sort of slips
away from me when the time gets by on the ad. We must have discussed it
or seen it at the house. I just remember now, but I think we probably did.
We must have seen it. So anyhow we went up to the post office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say “the <span class="locked">ad”——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The paper ad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The Bernard Weissman ad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; the Bernard Weissman ad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you now think, and let me get it straight, you previously
stated that you weren’t sure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I wasn’t sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That Ruby had noticed the Bernard Weissman ad after he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
wakened you at the house, and you were dressing, and before you left, but you
think now you must have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. We must have because we went to the post office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When he did see the ad, was there a comment about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; he wanted to know why on this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, there were two things he wanted to know why on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why the Earl Warren poster and why the Bernard Weissman ad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Right; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So then he had you take Polaroid pictures of the poster concerning
Chief Justice Warren, and then you went to the post office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. We went to the post office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the purpose of going there, and in connection with
what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, that was in connection—going to the post office was in
connection with the paper ad now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How was it connected to the paper ad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, there was a post office box on this ad. I just don’t recall
the number of the post office box. But he wanted to see if there was such a box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So did you go into the post office with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. We went into the post office. We saw a box with that number
on it. There was a lot of mail in there.</p>

<p>Now, of course, who it belonged to—we don’t know if it belonged to him or
not, but he did press the night buzzer. There was a little hole there where
you get the night clerk, and he asked the night clerk who—I think it was 1762
or something like that. I just don’t remember the number.</p>

<p>He asked him who it is. The night man says, “I can’t give you any information.
Any information you want there is only one man can give it to you and
that is the postmaster of Dallas.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Ruby make a reply to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not to my knowledge. You mean to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; to the clerk. Did he say anything more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; if I am not mistaken, I think he said “How do you get to
the postmaster” or something of that nature. I am not sure now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he annoyed with the clerk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he wasn’t annoyed with the clerk, but he was deeply annoyed
with the ad, with both ads.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he indicate to you how checking the box at the post office
would assist him in whatever he had in mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He wanted to know; he had also said that he had checked the
telephone directory and couldn’t find this Bernard Weissman, who supposedly
put an ad like this here, and couldn’t have been local because he looked to see
if there was a Bernard Weissman in the Dallas telephone book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t see him look it up. He merely told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He merely told me that. I didn’t see him look it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Larry Crafard go with you to the post office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he stay in the automobile, or come to the post office with
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I believe he came into the post office. I have to guess on this.
I am not sure, but I think he came into the post office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Then from there we went to the Southland Hotel coffeeshop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where is that located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is on the corner, on Commerce, and I don’t know what the
little side street is, but it is just below the Adolphus Hotel on Commerce Street.
I don’t know what the side street is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who went?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Jack, Larry, and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would assume we stayed there—maybe about 15 minutes would
be a rough guess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall the nature of the discussion between you at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. He reread this paper ad of the why’s of the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did he get the paper from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It happened to be it was lying on the counter. The news was
lying on the counter, and, of course, he ruffled through it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you say he reread it; so now you are quite certain that he
had read it before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; he must have read it before. See, now, I can’t tell you if
he read it before that or I showed it to him or what. I just don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case when he saw it at the coffeeshop, it was obviously the
second time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He was very disturbed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or the third time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He was very, very disturbed over both of these.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Explain what actions of his lead you now to the conclusion that
you describe as a disturbed condition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. His voice of speech; the way he looked at you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. His voice was loud or low or different or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; it was different. It was different; the way he looked at
you. It just don’t look like the normal procedure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you ever seen him in that condition before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would probably say—I don’t know how to put these conditions
together, but I have seen him hollering, things like I told you in the past, but
this here, he had sort of a stare look in his eye. I don’t know how to describe it.
I don’t know how to put it together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I didn’t catch that. What kind of a look?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. A stare look; I don’t know. I can’t express it. I don’t know
how to put it in words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But it was different from anything you had ever seen on Jack
Ruby before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was noticeably so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you notice it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I could notice it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did it disturb you any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I wouldn’t say exactly I was disturbed, but I could notice it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he seem to be concerned about the President’s death or the
ad or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. To me, I would probably say it must have been a combination of
the entire thing. I know he was deeply hurt about the President, terribly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say you know that. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What? By his feelings; by the way he talked about the family
and the children; by tears in his eyes, which I have seen, and I am not the only
one who has seen it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think that he was more disturbed than the average person
that you know was disturbed about the President’s death?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. All I know, while I can’t say about the average because all I
know, he was really deeply disturbed, but I can’t describe an average because
there might be another individual of his nature, too, who knows. Who knows
the affections of each and every individual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case his reaction was <span class="locked">such——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It was pretty well—you know, disturbed as I was and as disturbed
as I have seen many friends of mine, it was worse with him than it was
with the others who I have seen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is exactly what I was getting at. So he got hold of this
newspaper ad and read it again—is that it—that is, in the coffeeshop?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; he looked it over again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What comment did he make, while reading it or after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. While reading it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t mean his words, you understand, his exact words, but the
meaning, the thoughts expressed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; the thoughts. He can’t understand it. It is so penetrated
in his mind he can’t understand why somebody would want to do something
like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The ad had nothing to do with killing the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; but he couldn’t understand why an ad like this should break
out, about this ad. Another thing he couldn’t understand why in the world
would they want to impeach Justice Earl Warren. Incidentally, that sign come
out of Massachusetts, that billboard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it your impression that Ruby was putting the three instances
together as being connected in some way; to wit: the death of the
President, the impeach Earl Warren sign, and the Weissman ad? Was he seeming
to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He was seeming to do at that time—he was seeming to do with
the impeachment of Earl Warren, and the Weissman sign; he couldn’t understand
why these things were of a nature—I don’t know how long this billboard
has been out. I don’t know if it has been a day, two, or what it was, and then
the ad break out the same day that President Kennedy was coming in. He
wanted to know the whys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, as I understand you, you gathered that was
running through his mind, was why the ad, and the poster, appeared at the same
time as the visit of the President; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would probably say it is something of that nature, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I want to distinguish that, if possible, from another situation,
and that is whether or not you gathered that he was disposed to place the killing
of the President together with the poster and the ad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Run that again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From what you could gather from his attitude, from what he
said and how he acted, do you think it was running through his mind that there
was a connection between the Earl Warren poster, the Weissman ad, and the
killing of the President rather than the President’s visit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I would say the subject at that time, when he was looking
at the sign and taking pictures of it, and the newspaper ad, that this is where
he really wanted to know the whys or why these things had to be out. He is
trying to combine these two together, which I did hear him say, “This is the work
of the John Birch Society or the Communist Party or maybe a combination of
both.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the work of those two; the death of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, no, no, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The publication of these signs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He did not indicate what his impressions were as to who was
behind the death of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he didn’t indicate that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nor did he seem to associate the ads and the poster with the
President’s death?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know about that part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you do know that he was wondering why these two things,
the poster and ad, should come out at the same time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Now, mind you, I don’t know if they come out at the same time,
because the billboard, I don’t know if that thing was there a day or a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But he was associating the two of those together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or trying to find out if there was any connection between those
two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; he wanted to know why.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was the fact that the ad was published and the sign was
posted that he attributed to the Communists or the Birch Society.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; and he couldn’t understand why the Dallas Morning News
would ever print such a thing like that, say that in their paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You see what I am trying to get at is whether he manifested in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
any way that his thinking associated the assassination of the President with the
posting of the Warren poster and publication of the ad, or rather whether he
was simply associating the fact of the publication of the ad and the posting of
the poster with communism, and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. To my belief I think he was trying to associate the ad and the
poster with the Communist Party or the John Birch Society.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not gather from what he said that he associated the
death of the President to the Birch Society or the Communists or any other
group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not at the time that we were talking; rather, he was talking
about the signs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is, the poster and the ad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The poster and the ad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you all talked to anybody else in the coffeehouse, in the
coffeeshop?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I don’t think there was anybody in there at that time outside
of, I think, a cashier and probably a waitress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall whether he made any comment to the cashier or
the waitress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Larry have any comment to make that you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I just don’t remember if he had any or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, when Ruby stated what you said he stated concerning
the poster, and so forth, did you have any comment to make about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, nothing compared to him. Of course, after I heard him
mention it, then I sort of wondered also why an ad like that would be put in
the paper, or why anybody would want to impeach Justice Earl Warren. What
did it mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Jack had taken the pictures and he had gone to the post office
to check on the box. Did he state what he intended to do further?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then you tried to calm him down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it your impression that his state was that he should be
spoken to by a friend and calmed down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, I don’t know. It is hard for me to say these things. Who
would really know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But in any case you didn’t argue with him about his view?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I don’t argue with him at any time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not state a concurring view, I take it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or an opposing view?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nor did Larry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Larry I can’t speak for because I just don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you don’t remember whether Ruby spoke to anybody else
or anyone else spoke to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then what did you all do next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Before you go on, did Jack indicate what he was going
to do with the photographs that he took?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. He just took them and he never said what he was going
to do with them. Of course, I know what the windup was with them later on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, I believe the local policemen got them after the shooting
when they searched him, took his money and his papers, and all of that, and I
believe those pictures were with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When <span class="locked">you——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. At least I assumed the pictures were with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall where this sign was located? When you rode out
there in the car, do you recall any conversation you had with him, out to the
sign?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was covered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You see, when I have to jump 5 months back, it is hard to
remember little things. It is not holding back. It is hard to remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you all go then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. From there he dropped Larry off, and Larry went back up and
went to bed, up at the club. Then we went home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there any further discussion at all between you and Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Let’s see; I think we put on the TV for awhile that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was about what time of the morning when you got back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say somewhere between 5 and 6. Of course, I am guessing
the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was still dark, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, but I think it was sort of a break already; you know, sort
of lighting up a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Go on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. And if I remember right, I think it was a rerun of the episodes
of the day, if I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go to bed before Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You mean when we came back to the apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The same time. We went at the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you all looked at TV for a period. How long a
period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know; maybe 10 or 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you all went to bed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You went to sleep?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whether he did or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, he went to bed. I <span class="locked">assumed——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were in a different room from him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. I assumed he did, because when I woke up he was still
asleep; you know, later on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say I must have woke up around, I don’t know, 10
o’clock, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is Saturday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Saturday morning. I would say something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was still asleep?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; he was still asleep, but through the normal shuffling, you
know, going to the bathroom and such and such, it woke him up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was the telephone in that apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In the living room, but it had a long wire.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But the ringing sound came from the actual machine itself?
The ring would be where the phone was located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was the phone located that night, do you know, in the
living room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think it was in the living room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How far from your bedroom was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I <span class="locked">couldn’t——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As close as his?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Let me tell you. In the living room, of course, he had one of
these extension wires that would probably run, what, 13 feet or something like
that, 12 feet, I don’t know what the extension is, but where it was at that
moment I don’t know. I assumed that it was on the table. I just don’t
remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would he normally take it in his room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think he could get it all the way in his room. You see,
he had the far bedroom and my bedroom was closer. I could take it in mine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
but I don’t think I could take it in his, or he might be able to take it just
partially a little bit, but I don’t think it would extend that far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If the phone machine was in the living room where it normally
was, you would be closer to it, right, than he would?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I take it you did not hear a phone call for him that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever had occasion where the ringing of the phone
wakened you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would have to say “No” on that because I am always up
before he is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us whether or not if Jack had received a phone call about
8:30 Saturday morning you would have heard it and it would have wakened
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. If he did I just don’t recollect. I wouldn’t say he did or
didn’t have one because I just don’t remember if he did have one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t remember if he had one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That I understand. But what I am asking you is whether or
not the ringing of that phone in the position it was as you have explained it
that is closer to you than to him, would have awakened you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh sure, sure. I could have heard it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you willing to go so far as to state that since it did not
awaken you, that there was no phone call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I couldn’t quote because I don’t know if there was a phone
call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is not what I asked you. I am asking you whether you
are willing to state that if there had been a phone call, it would have awakened
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would assume so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me go back a bit here. Up until the time you went to
bed early Saturday morning, had Jack told you what he had done since the
President was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I know of some of them. I know that he went to the
synagogue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you did he tell you that night? I am not asking
you what you know now, but before you went to bed Saturday morning had
Jack told you what he had done that night, rather what he had done since
the President had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think he went to the—wait, I don’t remember if he told me
that night or it was the next day. This is the thing I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is what I am trying to get at is whether you have any
recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember, but I do know that he had told me that he
went to a synagogue and that he brought sandwiches around to the police
station, these are things I knew that he did. But I don’t remember if he
told me that night or the next morning. I don’t remember which time it
was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you got up the next morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Jack up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he was sleeping.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you see Jack before you left the house Saturday
morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh yes. He was still home when I left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he awake?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So you talked with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is where I had left off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is right. That is why I stopped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you said as a matter of fact here that the process of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
your waking up and moving around the house and so forth wakened him.
How long did you stay around the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Saturday morning you are referring to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; after awakening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Saturday morning I must have left, as a guess, mind you, somewhere
around, maybe somewheres between 11:30 and 12:30. Of course, I am
only guessing. I could be a half hour off or I might be an hour off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say that you stayed around the house anywhere from
1 hour to 2 hours after you awakened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I would probably say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And during most of that time Jack was awake and up, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. He awoke after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you recall the substance of the conversations between you
during that period of either 1 hour or 2 hours or something in between?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, we watched TV a bit, and he had mentioned—of course,
he wasn’t feeling good when he woke up—he had mentioned the fact, he sort
of rehashed the President and the kids all the time, how sorry he felt for them
and how a great man like President Kennedy could have been shot. He thought
this was a terrible thing to happen. Many a time he went through this how
sorry he felt for the kids and Mrs. Kennedy, a poor tragic thing like this to
happen to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you that he had decided to close the clubs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I wasn’t with him. That was Friday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand that, but I mean by Saturday morning, we are
speaking of the conversations of Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; this I already knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You already knew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you find that out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Friday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The ad in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is how you first saw it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is how I knew. That was an ad at the same <span class="locked">time——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you discuss with him at any time, either on Friday night
or Saturday morning, the fact that he had closed the clubs, and the reason
therefor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He told me why he closed the club. He put this in heavy black, in
heavy black block, that the Carousel will be closed Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday, because he thought it was a terrible thing for anybody to be dancing
and entertaining or drinking of that nature there at a time such as this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say that he put an ad In the paper Friday night that the club
would be closed for 3 days?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know what time because I assume he put it in sometime
Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But the first time you saw the notice about the closing of the
clubs, there was an announcement that the club would be closed for 3 days?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, I mean Friday, Saturday,
and Sunday. That is the way the ad ran.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you saw that on Friday night before going to sleep?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever talk to him about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. About the ad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Being closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I told him that I read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what was his comment, or query?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He was hoping that everybody else would close. He was hoping
that the two other strip joints would close when they read his ad, because he
didn’t feel they should be open on account of the simple reason of the tragedy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
that happened, where they should be having entertainment, dancing, and drinking.
He didn’t think it was the right thing to do at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he indicate to you that he thought it would hurt them if they
did not close also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That it would hurt their business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The other business, his competitors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, I don’t know about that, but I assumed, of course, I am
assuming only what I think, that I believe a lot of stores also closed that day.
I think Neiman Marcus closed. I believe in that downtown area there was quite
a few stores that did close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did it come to your attention that he was attempting to keep
his competitors from knowing that he proposed to close?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. How could he when he ran an ad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean for the Friday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. To keep them from knowing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ever indicate to <span class="locked">you——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. As a matter of fact, I would think he would want them to close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. And I assumed that the way he put that ad in there. He thought
everybody should observe something, such as what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you aware that he had told Larry Crafard not to put a
little sign that was posted in front of the Carousel, not to tack it up announcing
the closing of the Carousel until after the time for the opening of the other
competitors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; because I never saw him that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But he didn’t indicate to you as a matter of fact that he would
like to see them open while he was closed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In grief over the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I was sort of inclined with my own thoughts in mind that he
would probably want to see them closed. This was my own thought of mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack give you any of his reflections on how this tragedy
of the death of the President would affect the community of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; not that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am talking about either Friday night or Saturday or at any
other time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You are referring to the individuals in the city of Dallas, right,
the people of the city of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The business principally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall his making any comment to the effect that this
tragedy would hurt the convention business of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. If he said it I just don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he make any comment to you that you recall or heard to the
effect that the tragedy and the hurting of the convention business would hurt
his own Carousel and Vegas business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He did not comment upon that at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. If he did, I just don’t remember. I really don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was his general condition on Saturday morning during
the hour or 2 hours that you had occasion to observe him as opposed to the condition
that you have already described on Friday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He still had that hurt feeling within him of what happened, and
apparently this had never left his mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he talk about the poster and the pictures he had obtained
of it, or the Bernard Weissman ad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He was now referring to the tragedy of the President, and of
the family, what would happen to the family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, on Saturday morning the events of earlier that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
morning, that is his agitation over the poster and his agitation over the advertisement
seemed to have passed away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know if it did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But he didn’t comment on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember him commenting on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And his attitude at least was different in that regard than what
it was the night before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What he thought I still don’t know about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have given us a description of what his reaction was to the
poster and to the ad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; now what <span class="locked">happened——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That Friday night. All I am trying to do is get a comparison of
his attitude in those areas between the two times. Do you see what I mean?
I gather from what you tell me, let me see if I can rephrase it, that on Saturday
morning the stress, if it could be called that, or the most important aspect of his
reaction that you observed was his feeling of sorrow as to the President’s family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Saturday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; which was working on him pretty good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now you say that it was working on him pretty good, and that is
a mental impression that must have been created by the happening of events or by
statements being made. How was it working on him pretty good? What did
he say or do to convey to you that it was working on him pretty good?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He kept on repeating these things, numerous times he repeated
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that extraordinary for him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would think it would be. To me it would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what else was he doing that indicated to <span class="locked">you——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. And I had seen him cry, because I guess who hasn’t you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. And I had seen him cry, and he just got that funny look in
his eyes. I don’t know how to describe it. You call it a far-away look or a
look of something. I don’t now how to tear it down. But it wasn’t a natural
look.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have that impression that morning or have you reconstructed
all this in your mind after all the events had happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. About his looks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; you could see it. After all, I have been around him enough
to know the difference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You noticed the difference. And, of course, he shot Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You noticed this difference, and you now have a recollection of
noticing that difference about the events of the next day; is that right?</p>

<p>Let me show you what I mean. I want you to try to remember whether you
had a distinct impression, which you now recollect, on Saturday about his
worsening condition. Do you have that recollection now, Mr. Senator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I could tell by facial expressions, facial look.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I am getting at is whether or not in thinking over this
thing as you must have done, of course, that you reconstructed all of this,
and that your recollection is of the reconstruction rather than of the fact
itself. Do you understand what I mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t know what you mean when you ask me if I am
reconstructing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I mean is this. When after all this whole thing came
to a climax with the shooting of Oswald by Ruby, you must have put all of
your thoughts together concerning those last days, and as a matter of fact you
have been questioned a number of times by a number of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Including Government agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And including his lawyer. What I want to know is whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
what you are telling us now is a recollection of the reconstruction of this whole
period, or is it now a distinct recollection independent of any reconstruction
that you made in telling the story to anybody else. Do you remember now,
today, that on that Saturday morning you had the feeling that man is getting
worse on this subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is the way he appeared to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you remember that now, that that thought turned over in
your mind on Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did it alarm you in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know how to describe myself with it, but I know it
didn’t look good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your fear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I wasn’t fearing anything. I just didn’t like the way he
looked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say it didn’t look good, in what way do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It didn’t look like the normal look as I have known him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was your concern, if not your fear, that he might go off his
normal method of thinking or that he would do himself harm? I mean were
you concerned or was it just simply an observation which you passed on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am observing all this. You know I can tell. But I didn’t
know what to think. I didn’t know how to think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you have already said that you didn’t have any fears
of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I wasn’t afraid of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; but I mean were you concerned that something might happen
to him, that he might do something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; not particularly; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you think <span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The thing is I never asked him the thoughts within him or
what he was thinking about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did it occur to you that maybe somebody ought to talk to him
about it, that his grief was going to the point, or his condition of being upset
was going to the point that somebody ought to talk to him about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I know he visited his sister, and, of course, both were in grief
together, and I don’t know if he contacted his rabbi or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you mentioned a little while ago that he told you he
had been to <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. To the synagogue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To the synagogue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. If he talked to the rabbi, I don’t know. Now, I know that he
went to the synagogue that Friday night to pray for the President. Now, if
he had personal contact with the rabbi I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whether he went to the synagogue on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. I really don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You left him at the house when you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you left at approximately 12:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say something around that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He would certainly not have gone to the rabbi then, to the
synagogue, on Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. I mean I couldn’t answer that. I wouldn’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Maybe you can, or at least you can give us some facts. He was
asleep when you awoke at 10:30, isn’t that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; but he was up. He Was up when I left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you left at 12:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am only assuming within an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So it could have been 11:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. 11:30, 12, 12:30. I can’t say because actually, you know,
when this period is going on, I am not watching clocks. I don’t own one. I
can’t go by a timetable because I didn’t have the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Certainly, he didn’t leave the house from the time he got up until
you left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I left first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Now, what time he left I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But he didn’t leave the house from the time you got up until the
time you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, perhaps we can fix the time when you left a little better
by going on and seeing where you went. I ask you where you went?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Saturday where did I go? Saturday I think I stopped down,
I think my first stop was down at the coffee shop. I think I went down for
coffee, and my whereabouts, I don’t even know where I went that day because
I don’t work on Saturdays. I guess I probably just as well stood around. Just
where I went, I remember where I went Saturday evening, but I don’t remember
where I went Saturday afternoon. Just no particular place or anything
unusual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You do recall that your first stop in any case was the coffeeshop?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which one was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think it was Eatwell Coffee Shop that I went to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had sort of breakfast and coffee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Coffee and. Maybe coffee and a doughnut or coffee and a bun
or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were driving the Volkswagen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were not on business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you say you have a distinct recollection of some event that
night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Of where I was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh yes; because when I came home that night, I think it was
around somewheres between 7 and 7:30, I think I come home that night, and
I come home with some groceries that I wanted to make. So I made some
groceries <span class="locked">and——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was Jack home at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; he was gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was not there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he wasn’t there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was about 7:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say I think it was around 7:30. So I made the groceries
and then I left some for him, and I ate and I was assuming that maybe he
would be home by the time I was making the groceries. But he wasn’t home,
so after I ate I went out again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you been drinking that afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember. Possibly I may have had a beer or two.
I just don’t remember. I am not a heavy drinker. I am not a drunkard, mind
you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I didn’t mean to infer that at all, but I was wondering why
it was that you couldn’t give us any indication of where you went, whether it
was one or several places between noon or 12:30 until 7:30 that night. I think
you can remember some of the things, some of the places.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, let me see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t come home until 7:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I was out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you follow any usual Saturday afternoon routine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. There is nothing. There is no routine. Saturday, there
is no routine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t call on any customers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; nothing. Just out, that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you riding around for 7½ hours?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This is what I am trying to think, where did I go. I don’t
remember if I called my lawyer friend or met my lawyer friend or not that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is your lawyer friend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have got—Jim Martin. I don’t remember if I called him.
Once in a while I’d have a beer with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you don’t know whether you had a beer with him, I suppose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember. I just don’t remember the routine of the
day. There was nothing that I did in general.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did go to some grocery store to pick up the groceries?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember which one that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember which grocery store it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I think I went to Safeway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Safeway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Safeway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On what street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is on Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well now, does the recollection of that fact, which must have
been what you did almost immediately before going home—let me put it this way.
Was your trip to Safeway to pick up the groceries the thing that you did immediately
before you went home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So it would be safe to say, wouldn’t it, that you went to Safeway
around a half hour to an hour before you went home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I probably had gone maybe around 6:30 or 7, something like
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does that help to refresh your memory as to where you had been
just before you went to the grocery?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Is it possible to forget?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why yes, of course, it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Mind you this is 5 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But it is my duty to explore the possibilities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I know that. If I could think and help you out I would be
happy to, if I knew. I just can’t place, place to place, where I have been. I
may have been out having a beer or I may have been out chewing the fat with
some friend of mine. I just don’t remember what I was doing that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It may be that if you think about it a bit more you can help us
a little later on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I could if I wanted to, I could have made up a fictitious story
to you and say that I sat in the bar for 3 hours or I was out with some girl or
something like that. He is writing all this down. But I am telling you the
truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t want you to tell us something that is fictitious. If it is
a fact that you do not remember, then that is the fact and that is all we want to
know. I think that sometimes one’s memory is refreshed, as it were, by events.
If you can’t remember it now, we will come back to it a little later and see if you
can recollect what happened in this period of about 6 hours on that Saturday
afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Hubert, unless you want to pursue this further, let me ask
him a question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You indicated that you might have visited with Jim Martin.
Is this someone that you see regularly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. Jim is an attorney down in Dallas, a very good friend of
mine, who on occasions I will have a beer with. Now, possibly I may have had
it and I just don’t remember. I go to see him often, or I meet him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is Jim single?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Pardon me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is he a married man?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, he is a married man. He is the one who also was on the
Ruby case for a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where are his offices located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. On Main Street. As a matter of fact he just moved recently.
He was on Main Street, and he is still on Main Street, but the lower part of
town in what they call the Lawyers’ Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you accustomed to visiting at his home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I go to his home once in a while, yes. I have eaten dinner at
his home or I have went up there and cooked for him once in a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long have you known Mr. Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say roughly around 2 or 3 years I guess, something
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to meet him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think I met him through a friend of mine one day, if I remember
right. I think we were having a cocktail one day in the Burgundy Room.
I think this is how I met him. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Has he represented you in any legal matters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is he a friend of Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He knows Jack. I believe all the lawyers in Dallas know Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall if you visited in the area where the President was
shot, on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall if you visited in the area where the President was
shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Was I down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I drove by. I mean I didn’t stop. I drove by there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are there any errands or chores or anything that you customarily
do on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, nothing in particular, no. I will tell you Saturday I just
don’t like to work. I just don’t like to do anything particular, you know. Of
course, I would say that, of course, Saturday is a wash day. It is not that I wash
every Saturday, you know, or launderette day. I do my own.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you do Jack’s also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. Jack doesn’t even do his own. He sends them out, but I
do my own.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where do you do your laundry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Downstairs in the apartment. There is a couple of washers,
two or three washers, and a couple dryers right in the apartment. It is like
these machines similar to the store like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does Jack use those? Did Jack use those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have some particular place he sent his laundry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He takes it out and has somebody do it for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know where that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I was there one time with him when he was picking up his
laundry. If I am not mistaken, I think it was on the McKinney or Fitzhugh,
Fitzhugh or McKinney. I think it was somewhere up in that neighborhood. But
Jack, he takes his laundry and sends it to this place. He takes it over. But
instead of him doing it, he has a girl do it for him, and they straighten it out for
him when it dries up and all that there. Then he will come back and pick it up.
If he don’t pick it up one day he will pick it up the next.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He takes it over to this laundry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The girl does it for him at the laundry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. She does it with the soap and powder and all that. They have
girls over there, a couple colored girls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This would ordinarily be a self-service laundromat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But there are people there so that if you don’t want to serve
yourself they will do it for you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; that is the nature of this place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. His brother Sam, wasn’t he in the laundry business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Sam fixes those machines. I think Sam was employed by somebody.
I don’t know who he was employed by, but he fixes these washers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But he doesn’t have washaterias?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not to my knowledge; no. I think he is an employee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This area that you are describing, is that in the general Oak
Cliff area that you people lived in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no. This is in town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Downtown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not downtown but you have to go through downtown to go
uptown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What section would you call this section?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That area would be I would say sort of north—northwest part of
town I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. While you are on the laundry subject, wasn’t there some equipment
in the basement of the building you were in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I said I did mine but he don’t do his.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you came home, as I understand it, it was about 7:30, and
you fixed a meal for yourself. Before I pass for the moment from this period
on Saturday afternoon, let me ask you this. You were interviewed I think by the
FBI and by Elmer Moore of the Secret Service very shortly after these events, by
the FBI, I believe, on Sunday the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. No; first the police had me, the local had me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The local police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Then from the local they put me into the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they question you at that time as to your activities during
this period of 6 hours on Saturday afternoon between roughly 12 and 6 or 12:30
and 6:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; they questioned me, I believe they questioned me from
Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell them at that time that you had no recollection of
what you had done during this 6-hour period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember what I told them. I don’t know if I was asked
that, if I can remember right. I believe the questions they asked me, if I
remember right, is when was the next time I saw Jack that day, if I remember
right, that when I left, what time did I leave that Saturday, and I believe when
was the next time I saw him, if I am not mistaken, if that is the way it ran.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you give the police a written statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You signed a written statement for the police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; they made me sign a written statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember what time it was that the police questioned you
on Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I’ll tell you why I don’t remember. When they grabbed me,
they took me and shoved me into some little room all by myself, and I don’t wear
a watch because I am allergic to watchbands. I can’t wear a watch. And I
don’t know how long I was in this little room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that in the evening or the afternoon on Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That was the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And had you talked with Jack Ruby up to that time, between the
time of the shooting and the time that you were questioned by the police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The last time that I saw Jack Ruby is when he left Sunday
morning. That is the last time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you didn’t see him again on Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, I saw him when they waltzed me by. When the police got
through with me they waltzed me by to the FBI, that is when I saw him through
a glass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But never talked to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; couldn’t get near him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk with his sister or <span class="locked">with——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That day?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or with anybody else who had seen Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Before you were questioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I’ll tell you why. When I got out, when I got through with
this whole thing that night, it was already dark outside, and I for one had never
seen the shooting on TV, and I still have never seen it to this day, the shooting
on TV, and I never saw the runs because they had me there that late. I don’t
remember what time I got out that night, but I assume it was dark. It may have
been around 7 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So between the time you left Jack Ruby back at the apartment
on Sunday, and the time that the police first started to question you later on
Sunday afternoon, you didn’t see Jack Ruby in that interval?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At least to talk to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see Eva Grant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see Tom Howard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Tom Howard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s take a little recess at this point.</p>

<p>(Short recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We will convene again after recess, with the same conditions
and same understanding about the oath and so on.</p>

<p>Now I think you said you came back home at 7:30 on Saturday night and
you had bought some groceries and Ruby was not there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You fixed yourself something to eat, and I believe you said
that you left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; first of all I was thinking that he might show up while
I <span class="locked">was——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You fixed enough I think you said for two people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he come home before you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I left about maybe around 8, 8:30. As I say, I got <span class="locked">to——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have any phone calls prior to your leaving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. From there I went downtown. I think I went to the Burgundy
Room, if I am not mistaken, that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is in the Adolphus Hotel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; and I met a friend of mine there, and we were feeling
low. I was feeling low.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the name of the friend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Bill Downey.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is his occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He is a traveling salesman who sells musical equipment and all
the other stuff that goes with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Let’s see now, and Mike Barclay. He is an attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The three of you were together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Went out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The three of you were together you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. We went out to a bar and we had a beer or two, and
everybody was low down and got disgusted, and they all wanted to go home
including myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you all did so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. So we all went home, and I think I got home about 10:30.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was Jack there then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. Jack was there. He had eaten, and he said he was going
out. Now, where he went I don’t know, but he said he was going out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you describe his condition then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. His condition was in the same thing it was in the past.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it like it was in the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. He was in that same kind of condition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was no worse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, it is hard to say how much worse it was. He didn’t look
good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The reason I asked that question is <span class="locked">because——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You know when you say “worse,” I don’t know how to put
words together, you know, in expressions, the expression of an individual’s face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me show you what I mean. Perhaps you can help me when
I tell you what I have in mind. You have told us earlier that you thought that
his condition on Saturday morning was worse than it was on Friday night and
early Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think the expression you used, “the thing was getting at him,”
so that you formed the impression that the condition was worsening, isn’t that
correct? Is that a fair statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is the way it looked; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now I ask you if you will give us a comparison.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I know what you are talking about, but I don’t know how to
compare these things, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it worsening? Was it getting to him more? Did it seem
to be getting to him more Saturday night as opposed to 12 hours earlier roughly
Saturday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would probably say it was of the same nature or something
like that. It wasn’t good, because for me to try to express, and I don’t know
how to express a facial nature. It is just hard for me to put in words. If
you take the complete facial expression and the eyes and all that, I am not a
connoisseur at just being able to express these things, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I am just asking you for another comparison because you
had given us a previous one, and I thought that another comparison between
another period, two others periods, would be useful if you could give it to us,
and that is all. I gather from you that your general impression was that there
had not been much change in his condition over what it was on Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I will say something in the same nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That it was of the same nature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall what the nature of the conversation was between
you two that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; because when I walked in, he was just about on his way
out. I asked him if he ate. I told him I bought groceries. He said, “Well, I
ate already.” He ate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long after you arrived did he leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, God, within 5 minutes. It was just that short, that fast,
and out he went. Now, I don’t know where his visitation was. I don’t know
if he went to see his sister.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He didn’t tell you where he was going?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then or ever?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he didn’t tell me at all where he was going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He never did tell you later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; and I didn’t ask him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then you don’t know where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; because when I went home, you know, when I got home I
went to bed. I was going to bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you went to bed about 10:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say about half an hour later, maybe around 11.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what time he came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; because I wasn’t awake.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The next time you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Was Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What time did you awaken on Sunday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Sunday morning I assume it was somewhere around between
8 or 9, somewheres in that time. Just something in that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any way to fix it at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; you see, when I was on the witness stand with Mr. Bill
Alexander, now he tried to make me pinpoint it right down to the minute. It
is highly impossible. If you are not watching a clock and don’t have one, how
can you pinpoint these things? How can you really do it? How is it possible?
How can you pinpoint time when you are not watching it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case what you are saying, your best estimate is that
it <span class="locked">was——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have to estimate it. Now, as I say when I estimate it, I can
be 15 minutes, a half hour or maybe an hour off on time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you told us earlier that when you went to bed as early
as 11 o’clock you usually woke up quite early.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; this is why I say I probably woke up maybe around
8 or 9 that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was <span class="locked">Ruby——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Of course, I read in bed, you know. I read in bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was Ruby there when you woke up, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; he was sleeping.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did he waken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Ruby must have woke up I assume it probably would have been
maybe—of course, I have to guess again—I would assume somewheres around
between 9 and 9:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why don’t we put it in terms of how much after you did Ruby
wake up. In other words, no matter what time you awoke, can you tell us
how long after he awakened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It could be maybe three-quarters of an hour or an hour. I am
not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your first distinct recollection of him that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, the moment he got up he went to the bathroom, which is
normal for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you speak to him then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I did. Of course, we turned on the TV. He had the TV
going. He turned it on to see what the latest news was. Then he went to the
bathroom. Of course, then he washed, and he went in and made his own breakfast.
I only had coffee. He made himself a couple of scrambled eggs and
coffee for himself, and he still had this look which didn’t look good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Again I want to ask you, can you give us a comparison between
the look that he had that morning, which you just described, as opposed to
what it was on other occasions in the sense of whether it was growing worse
or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He looked a little worse this day here. But if you ask me how
to break it down, how he looks worse, how can I express it? The look in his
eyes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, is that one of the things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; that is the way it seems.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The way he talked or what he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The way he talked. He was even mumbling, which I didn’t
understand. And right after breakfast he got dressed. Then after he got
dressed he was pacing the floor from the living room to the bedroom, from the
bedroom to the living room, and his lips were going. What he was jabbering I
don’t know. But he was really pacing. What he was thinking <span class="locked">about——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was after he was dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; now, what he was thinking about, I don’t know what he
was thinking about. But he did, which I forgot to tell you, he did get that call
from this Little Lynn from Western Union.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You remember the call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you answer the phone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he had already been up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you know it was Little Lynn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I could hear him say. I heard him say Lynn, Western Union.
I heard him mention Western Union. I heard about the money and that he was
sending it to Fort Worth. She needed $25 for rent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I heard him mention $25 over the phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did he mention it, that he would send $25?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He would send $25 to her by Western Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he mention that it was for rent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; he told me after it was for rent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t hear Little Lynn ask for it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I couldn’t hear it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of course not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Therefore he must have told you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He said she called, and, of course, I knew it was Lynn because
I <span class="locked">knew——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You knew who she was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But after he hung up, he told you that she needed $25 for rent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he mention that she had called the night before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not know that at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. If she did I don’t know. This I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what time that call was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. It could have been anywheres between 9:30, I am
not sure, maybe 10. I am not sure what time it was. See <span class="locked">now——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s get at it this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Now you are placing me from the time I woke up to the time
Jack woke up, but I say with all these things I still have to guess the times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is why I am going to put it to you this way. The time of
the call is known, and that is why I would like you to relate events backwards
from that time, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I know that I was off on the time <span class="locked">because——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I am not trying to get you off. I am trying to get the facts,
so let’s approach it this way. How long before the Little Lynn call would you
estimate it was that Jack woke up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I couldn’t estimate the time, but I don’t think he was up too long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say he had gone to the bathroom and that he had cooked his
breakfast and that he had gotten dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he wasn’t dressed at the time Little Lynn called.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was not dressed at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he was still in his shorts. I think he was still in his shorts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If you could help us on this it would be valuable for us to know
about how long prior to the Little Lynn call did Jack actually get up. If you
want to break that into segments as to how long it was before he started breakfast,
and so forth, well, do that too. It may be helpful to you and it would be
to us. I can help you if you want along these lines. Did the Little Lynn call
come after he had finished his breakfast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I think that call came in before he had breakfast. I think
it did. I think it was before breakfast. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He answered the phone as I understand it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When he got up he went to the bathroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did the call come while he was in the bathroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After he left the bathroom he went to fix breakfast as I understand
it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know if the call came in before or after he went to the
bathroom. It was one of the two. I don’t know which. As I say, I would have
to twist it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t want you to twist it or to guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have to guess. I have got to guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have got to give your best estimation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. If I don’t know I can’t answer it because I have
got to guess on this. You put me to guesswork.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; we don’t want to have you guess. We want your best estimation
of the passage of time. If you don’t know, we certainly don’t want
you to guess. But you were there and we weren’t. Therefore, we would like
to know if you know. We don’t want you to guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. I don’t know the times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me give you another approach to assist you on this. You
said that you might have awakened anywhere from 8 to 9 yourself, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think that it was as long as 1 hour after you awoke
that the call came from Little Lynn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think so. You know this is very complicated when
you try to make a timepiece out of this. It really is. I mean especially if you
are not watching the time and don’t know the time. It is just a complicated
thing trying to place a time together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is true, but on the other hand when we have a fixed time,
sometimes we can relate events to that time in terms of hours and half hours
and so forth. That is what I am asking you to do now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You see when you are relating all three there, in the relation
of all three here from the time I got up to the time Jack got up to the time he
had his breakfast, from the time that Little Lynn called I would be jamming
all these things into maybe a half hour to an hour in differences, and they
would all almost clog together because I would have to guess at all these, because,
mind you, this wasn’t a great expanse of hours. This is why I say I will be
guessing and have to be wrong. Mind you from the time that I wake up at
8 o’clock in the morning, supposedly around 8 or maybe it was 8:30 or 9, I have
to have the answers, supposed to have the answers for what time I woke up,
what time Jack got up, Little Lynn in the short span of hours, and it is hard
to break these things down and be accurate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We understand that, and the purpose is to find out if it is possible
to know, and if your answer to us is that you can’t tell us, we don’t want
you to guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I can’t tell you. The reason it is hard to tell you, because I
would have to guess at all these and I have no hours. It was such a short span
of hours, I would probably assume this whole thing would consummate maybe
in what, approximately 2 hours, whatever it may be, maybe 2½ hours, I don’t
know. Now, you know you have got to jam hours in for these three things to
fit, and I can’t jam them together to make them fit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s see if we can’t fix sequence of events instead of trying to
fix hours. You got up first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And Jack got up next.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then another fixed event is the time that he went to the toilet.
That came next, didn’t it? He went to the bathroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then he fixed himself some breakfast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Now you have asked me if he fixed breakfast first or the telephone
call, I mean her call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember which came first. Now I am guessing that
the call came first. I am not sure. I can’t relate to be sure right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As to the sequence of those two events, we now know what your
recollection is, and that is that it could have been before or it could have been
after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I just don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But in any event, he certainly dressed after he got the call, is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. And after breakfast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And after breakfast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then after he dressed he paced about some?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, at least we have the sequence of events so far as we are
able to put them together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We also know, you see, Mr. Senator, that as to one sequence,
you don’t know. I am not critical of you because you don’t know, but we weren’t
aware that you didn’t know until right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. As I say, I mean when you take these four incidents and try to,
you know, try to jam them all into this short span of hours, I just can’t break
it down and be right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now let’s get to this. Was Jack normally a fast dresser or
would you care to estimate whether it took <span class="locked">him——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; Jack was never a fast dresser or never a fast washer. He
took his time. In other words, if I wanted to compare us, I could dress five
times as fast as he could or shave or anything else that much quicker than he
could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you say that normally it took him a half hour to get
dressed and shaved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. A half hour to get dressed and shaved? I would probably assume
it would take something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And do you think it took him that long on this morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know if it took him that long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But in any case he did dress and you would think that that took
him a half an hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would only have to guess. I can’t say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Normally it would have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I couldn’t assume the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Normally it would take him a half hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would so surmise that it would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did this pacing go on after he got dressed? It may
have been a matter of only a couple of minutes, but if it was more than that,
I think you would know it. I think if it was a half hour you would know it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say that he paced back and forth 5 or 10 minutes. I
don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Was it at that point that he left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say anything upon leaving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He said, “George, I am taking the dog down to the club.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That was it, and out he went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was fully dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He was fully dressed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you describe how he was dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, he wore a hat, wore a suit and a shirt and tie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say when he was coming back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; that is the only words he said when he walked out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you hear him speak to Elnora Pitts on Sunday morning over
the telephone?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know who Elnora Pitts is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It is a colored maid. No; I have heard that incident before, but
I don’t remember this at all. I just don’t remember if he did or not. I can’t, in
other words, I can’t refresh my mind whatsoever that Elnora called. Now, I
could be wrong on this, but my mind is not fresh for that long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would it have been possible that you were in a part of the house
or outside the house maybe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I wasn’t out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never left the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I was in my shorts all the while, unless I—no, I don’t even know.
Maybe I could have been in the bathroom. I am not even sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But in any case you have no recollection of Elnora calling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I do not remember at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it her custom to call when she was coming out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think he—I don’t know, but I know that he has driven by to
tell her to come up and clean the apartment sometimes or something of that
nature. Now, I know he did that one time, but I don’t know if it is his custom
to have her call or not. Maybe it had been, maybe it hadn’t been. I don’t
know on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I know I am asking you for another estimate, but I would like
to know what your view of it is. That is how long after Karen Bennett called
did Jack leave the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Who? Oh, Little Lynn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, Jack was still in his shorts then when she called.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This I do remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He had to dress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you are not sure whether he had fixed breakfast or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know which came first, if she called or he fixed breakfast
first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Leaving those aside, all I was asking was whether or not you
could give us an estimate of the time from when Little Lynn called until he
told you “I am leaving and I am going out and take this dog to the club.”
Have you any idea at all? If you don’t, tell us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Wait, wait, what time she called?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; the time interval between when she called and when he
left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I will make a wild guess. I would say it was at least three
quarters, it must have been about three quarters of an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On what do you base it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am just guessing. I can’t base it on anything. I am only
guessing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it quite guessing? You knew he had to dress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Sure you have got to dress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that took up some time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; had to wash.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you also say that he paced up and down for some little
interval of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So when you characterize it as a wild <span class="locked">guess——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have got to guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I wonder if it is a guess so much as it is a putting together of
these little segments of time and estimating what each would take.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am saying I would have to guess. I would have to guess all
this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you said three quarters of an hour, wasn’t it really the
result of your thinking of how much time would be occupied to do these little
segments of activity such as dressing and pacing up and down and so forth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
and you added them up and came to about three quarters of an hour; wasn’t
that your mental processes rather than a wild guess?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no, no. You asked me a question and I said I would have
to guess it. You know it is really amazing to put hours together. Mind you,
5 months have elapsed already, and to try to put these hours together you have
got to fluctuate. How can you be sure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is true, <span class="locked">but——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You have got to fluctuate. It is strictly all guess work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is true, but your attention was directed specifically to these
time lapses, not 5 months ago, but on that very day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. They were all guess work, they were all supposedly. I had to
give guess works.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What you are saying now is that the times that you estimated
then were guess works even on that very day as to the times on that very
day? You were examined, weren’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About 3, 4, or 5 o’clock in the evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. And I have always said I would have to guess the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Even as to that day you would have to guess the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I always have to guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On Sunday you said you had to guess the time as to the earlier
part of the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I had to guess the time Saturday, I had to guess the time Sunday
when he woke me up. I was only guessing it was around 3 o’clock in the
morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You see the reason why I am bringing that to your attention
is that you stated a moment ago that it is difficult for you to recall these things
after 5 months. But I was inviting your attention to the fact that your memory
had been directed to these intervals of time for the first time not today, but on
that very day, and your answer to me is that even on that day you were
guessing as to the intervals of the earlier part of the day; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Of times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Of times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that a fair statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. If a man doesn’t see a clock, or doesn’t see a watch, what else
can he do? What else can you go by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All I am saying is that even on the 24th when the police and the
FBI asked you about these segments of time on that same day, your statement to
us is that even then you were largely guessing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would have to guess the approximate times. If you can tell
me if you don’t see a clock or a watch, how do you tell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You might be able to tell by remembering what TV program was
going on at the time. Do you, at any particular time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. At that time I believe it was something about the late President,
but I don’t just recall what it was, but I believe it <span class="locked">was——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Practically everything that day was. You don’t remember any
specific part?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t; no. I don’t remember any specific part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack look at it, too? I think you said he did. Did he make
a particular comment as to a particular part then being shown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was the last time you saw Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me get this straight. Were you awake, did you wake up
on Sunday morning before Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Sunday morning? Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have an actual recollection of that, or are you stating
this because it was almost always your practice that you did wake up before
Jack?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I always—I would say 95 percent of the time I was up before
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But on this day do you have any recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I know. He was asleep because when I got up he was
still in bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you got up, as I understand; you made some breakfast for
yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You did not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I had coffee. I made coffee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Coffee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In this period between the time you got up and the time that
Jack left the apartment, did you remain in the apartment the entire period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. I was still in my shorts when he left the apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And were you visited by anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know which are the neighbors in that apartment? Let
me start over again? You lived at that South Ewing address on that very
same floor right next to Jack for 11 months, approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Before this Sunday we are talking about. Now, did you know
any of the other people who lived in the apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Just to say hello, but that is about as far as it went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know Sidney Evans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Sidney Evans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. If I did, I don’t know them by name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about a man named Malcolm Slaughter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. They work for the Red Ball Freight Company or Motor Express,
truck drivers apparently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Did they live there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. They were supposed to; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. If I did, I don’t know them by name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know the people who lived across the hall from you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. When you say across the hall, it was a <b class="sans">U</b>. That was just by the
U shape.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. A balcony sort of a situation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. A balcony, but it was a <b class="sans">U</b>. In other words, when I walked out
of my door, if I kept walking and went over the bannister I would hit the
ground. There was nobody facing me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about on either side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Jack was on one side. Then there were some girls on the other
side. The next apartment over there were three girls, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That <b class="sans">U</b> that you are talking about, is it sort of a stairwell, is
that it? The <b class="sans">U</b> is on one floor of the stairwell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And there were three suites on the landing that you people were
on? There was the old suite that you occupied, Jack’s suite which you were
living in on the 24th, and the suite occupied by some girls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, no; then it went down further. That wasn’t the end of the
strip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There was a hallway, wasn’t there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; there was a balcony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. A balcony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. A railing—I mean you are outdoors. There is nothing concealed.
It was just a railing and you are looking outdoors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you opened out onto this balcony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Along this balcony, how many other suites were there along
that balcony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Running our way, you have got to transplant in your mind—in
other words, say that I am facing my door right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. And the balcony goes <b class="sans">U</b>-shaped like this. Do you follow me?
In other words, this is all space out here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Everything in front of you is space?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Space. Now right past mine, if you turn to the right of mine,
then you walk down another balcony. See, there are balconies on this side plus
balconies this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, now along this same level that you were on, and following
the whole set of balconies around on the same level, how many <span class="locked">different——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The entire level.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. How many different?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This is another guesswork. I would say, I would sort of
estimate around a dozen places, a dozen apartments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now these dozen different apartments, was there a single stairway
that led up to that level, or was there more than one stairway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; there was two stairways. There was one from the front,
there was one level that come up South Ewing. In other words, you drive
around through the back where you park your cars and come up this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Another stairway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now on this level how many of those dozen suites there perhaps—how
many of those people did you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I didn’t know any. I never had a conversation with any of
them. Now I said hello to the girls next door, but I never talked to them,
never had a conversation with them. Of course, they were young girls, not
of my category. And the people on the sides, I didn’t know any of them. In other
words, anybody who walked in, you know, you would say hello whether you
knew them or not. But there wasn’t a conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Hubert, I want to carry this on a little bit from what happened
after Jack left the apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I promised him that we would stop at 5 because he expressed
the fact that he was somewhat fatigued. He has been up since 2:30. I think
rather than get into another segment we might adjourn for the day. You
were turning to another subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I was going to take him up to the time when he left the
apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That I think would be another subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In other words, the interval between when Jack left <span class="locked">and——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We have it now to the point where Jack has left the apartment,
and I think that is a good stopping point. It is a quarter past 5 and I had
promised we would stop at 5.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am not mad at you.</p>

<h3>TESTIMONY OF GEORGE SENATOR RESUMED</h3>

<p>The testimony of George Senator was taken at 8:35 a.m., on April 22, 1964,
at 200 Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C., by Messrs. Burt W. Griffin and
Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Senator, you will understand that this is a continuation
of the deposition which was begun yesterday, and that Mr. Griffin and I, who are
examining you, are doing so under the same authority and under the same
conditions as were indicated to you at the beginning of the deposition yesterday.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
Likewise, I take it that you understand, unless I hear to the contrary that
you are still under the same oath which you took at the commencement of the
testimony on yesterday; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, at the end of the session on yesterday we reached the point
where on Sunday, November 24, you had left your apartment or you were leaving
your apartment, as I recall it. Your testimony was that Mr. Ruby had already
left. I think you fixed, but just for the purpose of continuity at the moment,
would you now try to fix the approximate time at which he left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You mean when I left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; when he left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. To me, I thought it was somewheres between 10:15 and 10:30.
Of course, I found out hereafter in the courtroom that I was wrong, but this
at that time was the approximate figure that I had that he left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You told us yesterday that whatever time it was, your thought
was that it was approximately three-quarters of an hour after he received the
call from Little Lynn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. At the time he left—in my courtroom statement there I
fixed the time at approximately 10:15 or 10:30. That is where I thought he had
left around that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I ask you now to fix it not in point of clock time but in point of
how many hours or minutes it was, or parts of hours it was, after the long
distance call from Little Lynn in which you understood that she asked for $25.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would have to say it would probably be approximately somewhere,
I imagine somewhere between three-quarters to an hour. Now this is
about as close as I can think of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you base that upon two considerations, at least that you
stated to us yesterday. That he was not yet dressed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When Little Lynn called?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that he got dressed and cleaned up, washed up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then spent some short, relatively short period of time pacing
around, as you said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before leaving. And that you estimated yesterday I think it was
about three-quarters of an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Three-quarters of an hour. I mean this is just an estimation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when he left he told you he was taking the dog Sheba down
to the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he made no other comment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say what time he was coming back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; there was no mention of anything at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what did you do next? How long did you stay in the
apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. After he left I’m still sitting around in my shorts yet. I’m not
dressed or not washed or anything outside of having a cup of coffee. I had coffee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have TV on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I’ll tell you, after he left I was reading the Sunday paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you cut off the TV?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I didn’t have the TV going. I was just reading. I read
the paper, and from there I washed, shaved, got dressed, and took a ride downtown,
and as I say, this place, the <span class="locked">Eatwell——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long after Ruby left did you leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say it was about three-quarters of an hour, I guess,
something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then you went directly to the Eatwell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You used your Volkswagen, I think you said?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you park, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I parked right by the Eatwell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There is a parking lot there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; it is right on the street. You know Sunday there is no
difficulty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, then take it from there. Tell us what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. So I went in there. I sat down there. Now, this is the place
that I go every morning, you know, rather Sunday or Monday because I don’t
like to sit indoors. So I went there and had a cup of coffee. Then the first
thing—then I had another cup of coffee. Now, on my second cup of coffee I
heard the girl, the waitress—now where she got her information from I don’t
know. It had to be either telephone or radio, I don’t know which. Maybe they
had the radio on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you notice any kind of a radio of any type in the restaurant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they usually have any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not to my knowledge. The first time she said she heard that
somebody shot Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was she speaking to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no, it was loud; but it happened to be she was near me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There were other people in the place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not a lot. There were others you know, the usual morning
Sunday business in the restaurant is sort of minute. So what I did when I heard
that, I called up the lawyer. I was going to give him the news. I figured he
would probably be sitting home, you know, Jim Martin, who happens to be a
friend of mine. But when I called him. I spoke to his daughter and she told
me her dad and mother were in church. Dad would be home in half an hour. I
said all right, maybe I’ll call him back.</p>

<p>A short while later, the same girl, the same waitress hollered out that the
man—she wasn’t pronouncing the name right, the Carousel Club, but I sort of
got the drift of the name and she hollered Jack Ruby killed Oswald. This is
what she come up with later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would probably say about 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But it was after you had called Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; after I called Martin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You called Martin right away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I was going to tell him that. I didn’t think he would be—of
course, I didn’t know he was going to church or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He is a close friend of yours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. He is an attorney there; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Then when I heard that again, then I went up to see him. Of
course, I froze in that chair there. I said my God, I didn’t know what in the
world to think. Then I went up there and I no sooner got there, he had just got
there, I don’t know, I think a moment or two before me. His wife and daughter
had just come out of church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You went to his home, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I went to his house. I told Jim and he said, “I heard
already. I saw it on TV.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was already at his house, you said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; he was home already.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long after your phone call to him do you suppose you got
to his house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, he lived quite a ways. I would probably say it was about
a 20-minute ride.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You left the Eatwell just as soon as the girl announced that the
man who had shot Oswald was Jack Ruby?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I finished my coffee. I had about a half a cup left, something
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not attempt to call Martin again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I didn’t call him. I just went direct. I figured if he
wasn’t home I’d wait for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your reason for wanting to see Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, after all, this was my roommate. No particular reason. I
happened to know he was a lawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go to him as a lawyer or as a friend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. As a friend, as a friend. So I went up there and said, “Jim,
what in the world are we going to do?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I take it from what you said a moment ago, “After all, he was
my roommate”, that you felt some concern for yourself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I’ll tell you how I felt. I knew after this had happened, I
thought it was best that I volunteered than somebody come after me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You thought that somebody would be coming after you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, eventually they would have to. Eventually somebody would
have to be coming after me. After all, I was his roommate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I assume you were going to see Martin really to seek his advice
as a lawyer as well as a friend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; what to do. What should I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that true of the phone call as well?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that motivation true of the phone call to Martin as well?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. The first call, I was just going to tell him that I heard
that Oswald was shot, which the girl told me. But on the second time—I
<span class="locked">didn’t——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You realized your position at that time as being his roommate
and that gave you concern because you thought that the police might be picking
you up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you thought you had better have the advice of a lawyer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. To ask him what to do. Should I go down there or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do in fact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, we went down there. We went down there and, of course,
we had a tough time getting in. When we got down the place was just jammed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long were you at Martin’s house, speaking to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say maybe 5 minutes, maybe 10 minutes something
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And did you in effect ask him what you should do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I asked him what I should do and I thought it would be best
to go down. He thought so, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was your suggestion that it would be best to go down, or
his.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think it was a combination of both.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But in any case, within about 5 minutes the decision had been
made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. 5 or 10, something like that. I’m not sure of the exact time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The decision had been made to go down to the police department.
Now, what was the purpose of going down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I went down there, I thought it would be best if I go down there
than to be picked up, because after all, I’m his roommate and I know they are
going to eventually pick me up, because I was living with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, the idea was that you were going to go down
there and say, “Now look, I’m George Senator. I was a roommate of Jack
Ruby’s and do you have anything to ask of me?” That was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would probably say it was in the nature of that; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Incidentally, a moment ago you said that you were sleeping
with Jack Ruby, and in some circles sleeping with someone <span class="locked">is——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I said I was what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were sleeping with Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I was sleeping with him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you said that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I never said that, never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I misunderstood you then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You sure did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not <span class="locked">mean——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You sure did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did I hear that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I did not catch it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You sure did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, if I did hear that I was wrong about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You definitely were wrong. You definitely were wrong. I don’t
even remember this incident being said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is all right. I just wanted to get it clear, because some
people might misunderstand the phrase, and I would not want that to be misunderstood
if it were not true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It definitely isn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. So when you got there, what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The place was mobbed, and, of course, I believe there were a
couple of police attendants by the elevator as we got off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you go, in fact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Actually, I didn’t know where to go. We went upstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What entrance, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. I guess the front entrance, we went up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You went to the Chief of Police office, or what office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know what office I was at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whom you reported to or whom you were with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. First we were mobbed. I told these people, these two policemen,
whoever they were I don’t know, I told them who I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were they stationed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. They were right by the elevator as you got off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As you got off on one of the upper floors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. One of the floors. I don’t remember what floor it was on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you were not mobbed, as you put it, or you did
not speak to anybody as you came into the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On the ground floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But as you got off, whatever floor it was, two policemen stopped
you; is that the idea?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. I was with Jim Martin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And when they stopped you, they asked your name I suppose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you told them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Told them who I was. And then, you know, the place was
mobbed and there was a bunch, whoever these people were, reporters or whatever,
there were some of them there. They happened to overhear it, and they
mobbed me. They mobbed me.</p>

<p>Then eventually two great big policemen came over and one grabbed me on
one side of the arm, you know, they looked like giants to me, and one on the
other side and they took me into this room. Remember I told you they put me
into a little sort of solitary room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is on the same floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. And I don’t remember how long. I mean I had no way
of knowing time that I was in there in this room there waiting for somebody
who was going to—they said to wait there, I don’t know. They kept me in this
room. Then somebody finally approached me. They wanted a statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You got there, I suppose, about 20 or 30 minutes after leaving
Martin’s house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say something like that, between 20 and 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were, almost immediately after getting off on one of the
upper floors of the building, mobbed by the press group and taken by these two
policemen?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And put into a room on the same floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then was Mr. Martin with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He was with me, but he never, you know, when they took me to
this room they wouldn’t let him in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ask to go in or to remain with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He says “I’m his lawyer”; he was my lawyer. But we still were
separated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ask that he be allowed to remain with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He wanted to get in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you remember whether he actually asked to get in with
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It seemed like he wanted to get in. I mean I don’t remember
the exact words that he said, because they wouldn’t let him in, so apparently he
was trying to get in too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember whether you were placed under arrest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, never placed under arrest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you were escorted to this room and sat down, was the
door locked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you told to remain there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there any guards on the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not to my knowledge. I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you handcuffed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you say you don’t know how long you remained there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I couldn’t tell. This was a little tiny room. It looked like
where they keep some inventory books—not books, probably paper goods or
something like that. It was a very small room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you hear what was going on outside the room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, couldn’t hear a thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did the room have any windows in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was the light on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. It was very small. It was a very small room. As I say,
it must be a room like they keep paper goods, things of that nature, or something
like that in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did the police search you or frisk you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They did not take anything away from you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I wasn’t under arrest at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what was the next thing that happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, finally, I don’t remember this man’s name, you may have
a note of it, I assume he was a detective. He was in plain clothes. He questioned
me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he question you in that same room, or take you outside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, he questioned me in that room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just one man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t remember his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he connected with the Federal Government or the State
government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I assumed he was local.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you found out since who he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, I didn’t. I think he must have been a detective of some
nature. I mean I don’t know what his classification was, because all I know is,
he was in plain clothes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the nature of his inquiry?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It was, you know, what happened from the time of the shooting
up until the present time. That was the inquiry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The time of the President’s shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, from the President <span class="locked">to——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he more or less ask you to go over and to account for your
time during that period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You mean where I was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Am I right then in saying that his inquiry was to ask you what
you had been doing since the President had been shot and what Ruby had been
doing too, I suppose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Both of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He asked you concerning the events in your life during the
afternoon of Friday, November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I believe that is how it started.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And on the night of the 22d and the early morning of the 23d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. There is only one thing that slipped my mind to tell him, and
that was the paper issue, the newspaper issue and the billboard, “Impeach Earl
Warren”. That was the only thing I forgot to tell him that slipped my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell him that you had gotten up, that Jack had wakened
you early in the morning and had asked you to go out with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know if he questioned me on that or not. I don’t remember
if he did or not on that. I don’t remember if he did on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But if he <span class="locked">did——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. But I had been in a pretty shaky mood that day, most naturally
nervous.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But your point is that if he did ask you about whether you
had gone out with Ruby in the early hours of the morning, you did not tell him
about the concern of Ruby over the Bernard Weissman ad, nor did you tell him
about taking the pictures of the Earl Warren poster?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, I didn’t tell him that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what was your reason for not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No particular reason.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I’m sorry that I—I should have told him. If I thought
about it I should have told him that because I think this was a benefactor
for Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you say that the reason why you did not mention these two
episodes was forgetfulness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>I was a pretty shaken boy. I’m not used to something like this. This is something
that will shake you up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it that you were shaken up and thought it best not to mention
anything about it, or that you actually forgot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Just forgot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I assume that that officer then carried you through the
events of Saturday morning after you got up and Saturday afternoon and
Saturday night and Sunday morning, is that not so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And at that time did you tell him what you had done on Saturday
afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, because I didn’t—I don’t think I did because I don’t know
if I was questioned on that. As a matter of fact, to the best of my knowledge
I don’t think I was questioned at any time what I did on Saturday afternoon,
to the best of my knowledge that I can think of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean they questioned you about what you did on Friday
night and Saturday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And Sunday morning, but they omitted Saturday afternoon?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The best that I can recollect, it was more important of the
events of when I had seen Jack, and the times that he got home and when I got
home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell him concerning all of those matters approximately
as you have told us to date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You mean from the events of Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Friday, Saturday and Sunday up to the point we have reached
in this deposition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, but you are more thorough than they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long do you suppose that interview with the police officer
lasted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have no idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. From there he took me to the FBI on the same floor in another
room, and his story was about the same.</p>

<p>Of course, if I remember right, I think he goes back like you started, you know,
my <span class="locked">name——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, the FBI examination of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember his name. Yes, the FBI man. And if I recall
right, I think he asked me, you know, my name, how old I was, you know, like
you started off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He went into details as it were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Pardon me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He went into more detail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, yes; because the details—in other words, he started from
where I came from, my name and how old I was and things of that nature, like
you did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I think you said that his examination was thorough as it
were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, there was more to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In what way? Did he ask you for more details?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, he went into my personal life, you know, like you started
off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you say that his examination of you was along the same
lines as mine has been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; because—well, in certain parts I would say, but I think
yours are more meticulous—is that the proper word—than his. In other words,
yours are more thorough.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But he asked you to account for your time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you told him about going out in the morning with Jack,
having been awakened by Jack and going out, and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I forgot that. In other words, when they shoved me from
one to the other, it was the same way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you do not have any recollection of having told the
FBI that Jack had awakened you in the morning and that you had gone out
with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember if I did or not. I may have. I don’t remember
if I did or not, now, on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have any distinct recollections as to whether or not you
mentioned the Earl Warren poster or the concern of Ruby about the Bernard
Weissman advertisement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember if I did or not. Maybe I did, maybe I didn’t.
I don’t remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ask you about accounting for your time on Saturday
afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember that, either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did this interrogation by the FBI man take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Of course, it’s guesswork again. I would say maybe it took a
couple hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it one man or more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. One. I would say now——<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell either the State officer who interrogated you or the
FBI man who interrogated you that you had a lawyer and that his name was
Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not ask that your lawyer be present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What occurred then after the interview with the FBI man was
over? What happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Then they let me go. They released me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who did that, in fact, the FBI man or a State officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The FBI man. If I remember right, I think the FBI man said,
“That is all there is.” That is all there was of the interview.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were permitted to leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember what time you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say it was between 6 and 7 at night because I know
when I got outside again it was dark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was anybody waiting for you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; there was nobody waiting for me. Somebody gave me a
message, or handed me a message, I don’t remember who it was, that Jim Martin
would meet me, the fellow who brought me down, the attorney who brought me
down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that a police officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no; you mean who handed me the message?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it a written message? I asked that because you said you
did not remember who handed <span class="locked">you——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember who it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which would indicate it was written, you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember who it was. All he said, he would meet me
there. In other words, he was going to meet me across the street from <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it a verbal message?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think it was a written message. I don’t remember who gave
it to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You just put it in your pocket or something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You read it and threw it away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I knew I would meet him. So I met him. As a matter
of fact, I was with three attorneys when we met, either two or three attorneys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Griffin, do you want to ask any questions on this segment
that I have covered this morning up to this point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; I want to go back a little bit. When Jack Ruby left
the house Sunday morning, you were dressed, were you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You were not dressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I was in my underwear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you got down to the Eatwell Restaurant, can you tell
us which of the waitresses, management people, were on duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Which of the waitresses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And management people were on duty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say there were probably two or—no; not glancing
around or anything of that nature, I would probably say there were 2 or 3
waitresses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You eat there regularly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I stop there every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You say you know these waitresses?</p>

<p>Mir. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So what I am asking you is to tell us which of the waitresses
were on duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I could recollect the one who said it when I heard her say it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Which one was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know her name. I know her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you not know the names of any of the people who work
in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This girl here, I mean I know them all, but I don’t know them
by name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know any of them by name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t know any of them by name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know the names of the owners?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I know the owner. I know his first name. I don’t know his
last name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. His first name is Jim. There is a father and son. Jim is the
father and Charles is the son.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How old would you say they are?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would probably say Charles must be—of course, they weren’t
there that day. Charles I would probably say is in—could be in I guess his
late thirties, I’m not sure, and the father I would probably say is maybe in his
late sixties or early seventies.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you describe the waitress that was on duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. She was a woman about, I would probably say in her late
forties or maybe early fifties, dark haired if I remember rightly, and I believe
brown eyes. I don’t know how to describe her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know a waitress there by the name of Helen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Helen? A little short girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don’t know what she looks like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I know one. The other is a little short girl I think by
the name of Helen. I think it is Helen. See, now once in a while they wear
badges but I can’t remember one from the other, outside of their faces. I
always say hello to them. On the other hand, I never take that much notice of
who’s who.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Of course, the waitress who was on duty knew that you were
Jack Ruby’s roommate, did she not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think so. I don’t think she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The people at the Eatwell <span class="locked">knew——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Some know me but I don’t think this one knew me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. They know Jack as well as they know you, don’t they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t know if they know him. See, Jack and I never
went in there, I mean together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Jack eats there regularly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or ate there regularly, did he not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; Jack don’t eat there because he don’t like their type cooking.
No; Jack don’t eat there. Now I go there every day. I go there every day, I
go there every morning. I have coffee, I would say, probably 7 days a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there any recognition by anyone at the Eatwell while you
were in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. There was very few people in there that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But of the people who were there, did any of them appear to
recognize that you were connected with Jack Ruby when they learned over the
television set that Jack Ruby <span class="locked">had——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would probably say to the best of my knowledge, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, that would indicate that nobody said anything to you
about it. You did not have anything <span class="locked">to——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, they didn’t say a word to me about it. Now, if they did
or not, as I say, to the best of my knowledge, no. Now I can’t quote myself, if
I am that correct or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am curious as to any other people that you thought of contacting
after you heard that Jack had <span class="locked">shot——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; that was it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Of course, you——<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I called up Jim because I happened to know Jim and Jim was an
attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You thought about calling Jim before you knew who it was that
had shot Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know at the time that you tried to call Martin that it
was somebody associated with the Carousel Club that had done it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You mean Jack Ruby, my roommate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. Now, you say it was after you called Martin that you
learned that it was Jack Ruby who had shot Oswald, but you said as I understand
it somewhere between the time you learned Oswald was shot and you
learned Ruby had done it, you heard something about it being someone from the
Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You did not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So that at the time you called Mr. Martin, you had no idea who
<span class="locked">shot——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I called him because it was local news. That is why I called
Jim.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you think of calling anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you think of trying to get ahold of Jack Ruby to tell him
about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; because Jack left home shortly before that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have some idea where he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; none whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you walked into the police station, I understand you
to say that you were mobbed by members of the press? Did you say anything to
those members of the press?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, they ganged me so and everybody was throwing questions
at me, and I don’t even remember the things that I answered because they
asked me so many things and so many people were mobbing me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you were answering their questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I was answering some of them, whatever they were asking me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long would you say it was that you answered questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. Maybe about 5 minutes I guess before two
policemen nabbed me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember any of the questions they asked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; God, they was throwing them left and right. I couldn’t
keep up with them. I just couldn’t keep up with them, what they were talking
about. I was just in circles, you know. Now how can I answer these questions
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see reports in the newspaper the next day or that
evening about what you had said down at the police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I didn’t. I didn’t see no papers that evening. As a matter
of fact, I never even saw the run, I—still to this day—I’ve never seen the TV
of the shooting. I have never seen that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you went out to Martin’s house, did you have any fear for
yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any fear or thought that the police or someone might
try to implicate you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you describe yourself as being shaken up when you were
at the police <span class="locked">station——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Something like this, I would say the normal person it would
make him nervous. Here I have gone through a half a century already and I
have never had any incidents in my life, and I would say the normal person
would be shaken up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don’t have any more. Wait a second. Let me ask this. When
you came downtown with Mr. Martin, did you come down in his car or your car?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think I came down in my truck. No, I think I came down in
his car. I’m not sure but I think I came down in his car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall where you parked, whose car it was where you
parked downtown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Either parked on Commerce or Main Street, one of the two.
I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Near Harwood or near Pearl, or were you right in front of the
police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no; we were down further, just to grab a parking space.
I just don’t remember how far down it was, but I would assume, I think we
walked, I don’t know, maybe two or three blocks to my knowledge, something
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you come by the Western Union station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Going up with Mr. Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Either way, either going downtown or walking back to the
police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think we come up Commerce. I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me then be more direct about this. Do you have any recollection
that day of seeing Jack Ruby’s car downtown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; that I have never seen, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don’t think I have anything more, Mr. Hubert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before I pass on to another aspect, I think there is one point that
needs a bit of clarification. Mr. Griffin asked you whether or not you considered
calling Ruby when you heard that Oswald had been shot, to convey the news
to him as you conveyed it to your other friend, Mr. Martin. You said that you
had not because you didn’t know where he was; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, I knew he left the house, you know, before I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have also testified that he had told you that he was going
to take the dog to the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Therefore, you knew he was at the club or at least you had some
indication?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He could have been there. Now he told me he was going to
the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the club was just about a block away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So when you didn’t get Mr. Martin, you didn’t try Ruby at the
club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You knew the number of the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any comment to make as to why you didn’t call Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No particular reason. I didn’t think of it, because when he
left the house he said he was going to take the dog to the club and most naturally
I heard the conversation he was going to the Western Union, so who
knew where his whereabouts would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, of course, you didn’t know his whereabouts after you
called Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is right, there was no particular reason. It just happened
to be that I thought of Jim Martin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All I want to do is to give you an opportunity to state for the
record why it was that you did not next think of calling your friend and roommate
whose approximate location you knew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It just didn’t enter my mind, that is all. I just didn’t think
about it. There was no particular reason why.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you this, Mr. Senator. Was it your practice to spend
time socially with Jack Ruby other than when you saw him at the apartment?
Did you and he do things together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; first of all I’m out most of the time. When I get up in
the morning, I mean he is still sleeping when I got up, and I don’t see him in
the daytime. Maybe on rare occasions something will happen, but the overall
picture, no.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you say you are out most of the time. Is this in
connection with your business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have a set of calls that you make every day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I make calls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Regular customers that you call on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Customers, or at times probably get new ones.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now on Saturdays or Sundays you do not work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. With whom do you spend your time on Saturdays and Sundays
normally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Nothing in general. Once in a while I would meet Jim downtown
because Jim Martin comes downtown on a Saturday, like a lot of lawyers do.
They come down about 10, 10:30, 11 o’clock and they check their mail or any
messages come in, such as that. Incidentally Jim Martin’s office is right across
the street; of course, he just moved recently. It was at the Davis Building which
is across the street from the Adolphus Hotel on Main. He has been there for
quite a number of years to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who would you list as your friends in Dallas outside of Jim
Martin and Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, the people I stayed with who were friends of mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you give us their names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; Jean and Lindy Lauve, a fellow by the name of Bill Downey,
Tom Howard, the attorney. I don’t say I associated with him but he is a
friend of mine. Another lawyer by the name of Mike Barclay: he is a friend
of mine. Not that these are complete associations that you are with them every
day or so, or things of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But are there other people whom you see more often and you
are closer to than Barclay and Howard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; not particularly. Of course, every now and then an out-of-town
friend of mine would come in, a traveling man; if he happened to be in
Dallas I would see him, or he may call me. In other words, I’ll put it this
way—I had a particular hangout.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That was the Burgundy Room. I used to go there quite often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is in the Adolphus Hotel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is in the lobby of the Adolphus Hotel. When I used to
go in, you know, the latter part of the afternoon, around 5, used to always run
across friends that you know and we would always have a talk session or something
of that nature there. Of course, I had many friends that came in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you would say that you saw Barclay and Howard and Martin
more often than you saw the other people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Martin more so than the others. But the others, I’d see them
every now and then. Like the trial I’d seen them down at the courthouse
and things of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now what about the Lauves?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The Lauves, those are people who I stayed with, who kept me up
when I didn’t have a place to stay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But did you see them more often than you saw Howard and
Barclay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I stayed there every day. I was living there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I mean prior to the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Prior to that on rare occasions, on rare occasions. One time
I used to see them quite often. Of course, that is when I was traveling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But at the time that Jack Ruby shot Lee Oswald, of all the
people you have mentioned, Jim Martin was the person you felt the closest to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He was a close friend of mine. I used to see him almost every
day, especially more so during the trial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But what I am trying to get at is was there anybody else to
whom you felt equally as close?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I had—let me put it this way—I had a lot of good friends.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
I don’t know how you want to classify what you call close. Many friends
I had, good friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Apparently of all the people you knew in Dallas, the one that
you felt most inclined to call when you heard that Oswald had been shot was
Jim Martin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It happened to be I thought of Jim Martin, yes, and I called
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And if you had reached him at that time, I suppose you would
have gone out to his house or you would have carried this on further. You
have had some conversation with him about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I imagine so. I would imagine so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What I am getting at is you didn’t really have to convey the
news to Jim Martin or anybody else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; it just happened to be it was local news, you know. It
is like probably a thousand other people did, called their friends “Did you hear
this, did you hear that.” It could be anywheres in the country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When the President was shot did you call anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; because I didn’t know. I was told.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But when you were told did you call anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no; because the reason I didn’t call anybody, it was a
weekday. Now this is only guesswork. It was a weekday, and, of course, I
assumed that everybody knew it as fast as I knew it or probably faster than I
knew it, with the many thousands of people who were in that locale, they knew
it before I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, let’s continue from the point that you left the jail.
Did you meet anyone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I was with Jim, I met Jim Martin and another attorney who
I had only met for the first time and I don’t remember his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They were waiting for you or you met them outside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. They told me they would meet me somewheres.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. We met at a bar across the street from the courthouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know the name of the bar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think it was the TV Bar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The message you had was that they would meet you there, is
that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you did go there and talked to Martin and the other lawyer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; the other attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long were you with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. If I recall right, I would say we sat in that bar and had two
or three beers, if I remember right. I think I said to Jim “I don’t have a place
to sleep or a place to go” because I was afraid to go home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You told that to Jim Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I told that to Jim, and I believe—wait a minute now—I believe,
I am not sure but I think I went to his house and he said he would put me up
on the couch if I was afraid to go anywheres, which I was. From there on in
I was afraid to go home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Why was I afraid to go home? Well, I was just scared, that
is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know of what, but I was scared.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Obviously you were scared that somebody might try to hurt you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Very possibly, yes; on something like this. Now who or what
I don’t know but that was the instinct I had. As a matter of fact I was scared
for about 10 days after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you were scared for 10 days after <span class="locked">being——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In other words, for about 10 days I was afraid to sleep in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
same place twice. Who I was to fear I don’t know, but just the normal thing,
I was afraid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you say you slept at different places every night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; until I finally moved in with Jean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What were some of the places you slept in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I slept at Jim’s a few times. I checked into an inexpensive
hotel one time. I slept at another fellow’s apartment one time and then I
finally went to Jean’s and stayed there, Jean Lauve. She said she would put
me up because she and everybody else knew I was scared. You asked me what
I feared. I don’t know who I feared or what I feared but I <span class="locked">just——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You honestly feared that <span class="locked">somebody——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I was just in fear that is all which is a natural instinct in a
situation such as this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am not saying it is not natural.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But I am trying to see if you had any idea in your own mind
what you were afraid of. Now obviously you were afraid of being hurt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Certainly I was afraid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Possibly being killed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; now of who or what I don’t know. It could be a crackpot.
I don’t know what it could be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you give some consideration to the thought that whoever
had been involved with the killing of the President might want to kill you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. I didn’t know who to fear. It was just a natural
instinct. I would imagine anybody in the same situation would probably
fear something. It was just a natural thing for a human being to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am not criticizing you, Mr. Senator; at all. I am just trying to
find out the reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I had no reason or any particular thing. There was no
reason for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mentioned one, that a crank might try to hurt you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. A crank might. Yes; I can’t measure what or who. It was
just a fear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Isn’t it your thought that there might be some group of people
who might want to hurt you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I can’t say it was a group or what it is or who it may be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand that you don’t know of any group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But didn’t it cross your mind that there might be a group who
would want to get rid of you for some reason or other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This didn’t enter my mind that it was any group or anything
of this nature here. All I knew is I had a fear. I don’t know who, but something.
I was just afraid, that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you arm yourself in anyway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I never armed myself in my life. The only gun I ever had is
when they had me overseas. That is the only time I ever had a gun. I never
carried a knife or a gun in my life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do during these several days when you were in
effect afraid? Did you move out in the open or did you <span class="locked">stay——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I was afraid of the nighttime, not the daytime. In other words,
I wanted—I didn’t want to be in an isolated place anywhere. It is not that I
wasn’t out at night or daytime, which I was, but I didn’t want to be in an isolated
place. In other words, I wouldn’t want to be walking down a lonely street
or something like that because that would scare the life out of me. But around
groups or something like that, I didn’t fear it that much. Now what I feared
I don’t know, but it was just a natural thing I feel any individual would fear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you communicate that fear to Jim Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not only to him but to many of my friends. I said, “I’m just
afraid.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was for that reason that several of them put you up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is right. I told them I was afraid. They said “What are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
you afraid of?” You know people say, “What are you afraid of?” I said, “I’m
just scared, that is all”—and who wouldn’t be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So your friends also were asking you as I have been as to what
would you be afraid of. That is a fact isn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; they asked me, “What are you afraid of?” I said, “I don’t
know, I’m just afraid, that is all.” I can’t say who I am afraid of. I don’t
know who I am afraid of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I know that you wouldn’t know necessarily individuals, but you
must have done <span class="locked">something——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Or groups, individuals or groups as you mentioned. I can’t
place my finger on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But what I am suggesting to you is that your fear came from
the thought that any individual or group that had anything to do with either
the slaying of the President or the slaying of Oswald may have you in mind
next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; my thoughts didn’t run that way. My thoughts were nothing
but fear, and I didn’t have my mind on any groups or anything like that. I
just didn’t know. It might be an individual crackpot walking the streets, who
knows, he doesn’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; I think that is a very understandable reason that you gave
us as to the crackpot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It could be. I don’t know what it could be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It went beyond that though, didn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just your fear of a crackpot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is all it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. When you say “beyond that,” what do you mean “beyond that”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That your fear went beyond the mere fear that a crackpot would
hurt you, your fear and your thought about the matter went to the point that
some people other than a crackpot <span class="locked">might——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I didn’t think that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then are you willing to say that it was only your fear of a
crackpot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I use “crackpot” as one but I don’t know how to describe it.
Who knows what it could be. It could be an individual walking the street,
I don’t know. When I was scared I had no particular thing in mind. It was
just I was scared, that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did it ever occur to you during this period when you were
frightened that Jack Ruby might have been set up by someone to kill Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Run that back again. Let me understand it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did it ever occur to you at anytime after the shooting and
when your fears began to develop that Jack Ruby might have been part of a
plot to kill Oswald, and that there were others involved in the matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That never occurred to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was not any part of the basis of your fear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I understand you then, you considered right from the start
that this was an individual act on the part of Ruby, unconnected with anyone
else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Run your words again. I’ve got to follow you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I say as I understand it then your thoughts from the very
beginning were that Ruby’s action was his own and that no one else was
connected with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Did you say his actions was his own when this thing
happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; and that you never considered that anyone else was in
it at all but Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; definitely not. I never thought of anything such as that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t understand your answer. Pardon me. You wouldn’t
think of anything such as what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. To me he wasn’t connected with anybody whatsoever of any
nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You think that now and you have always thought that, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; he wasn’t connected with anyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Therefore, your fears could not have been based upon the
thought that anyone that he was connected with would want to hurt you,
obviously, since you never thought that he had any connections?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he didn’t have any. Let me put it this way. Even today
I still have a certain fear. Now you ask me what I fear today, I don’t know.
This is something you just don’t erase out of your mind, that is all. This is
not a little thing; this is a big thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After that Sunday night, when you talked to the lawyers for
awhile, you went home I understand to Jim Martin’s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. If I remember right, I’m not sure but I think Jim put me up
because I was afraid to go home and I didn’t have a place to go to. If I
remember right I think he did. I think I went to his apartment, his home rather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am moving to the next few days, Mr. Griffin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you ever given any consideration to the thought or to the
possibility that someone else might have been associated with Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In the killing of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am not asking you whether you ever believed such a thing
but whether you ever explored that possibility in your own mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; never could think of anything such as that. Jack was a
true American. He loved his country. This is for sure. He loved the land
that he lived in as I have told you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You indicated before that there were a lot of things Jack didn’t
talk to you about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That Jack would talk to me about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That he did not, Jack didn’t talk to you about everything he did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Jack lived in the show business type. This is his life. He
lived in the glamour of the show business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you feel that Jack talked to you about everything that he
was doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Who can answer that? How could I answer that? How could
I really answer that and know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, sometimes you associate with a person and you know he
is the kind of person who doesn’t go out and talk about everything he is
doing, in fact that he is the kind of person who is reticent to talk about some
of the things he is doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say Jack was the type that would not hold back
to my knowledge, that would hide anything. I don’t think he would hide
anything from me. I can’t say positive but I don’t think he would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, he didn’t discuss his relationships in the Vegas Club
or in the Carousel Club with you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To any extent, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Look, his money parts he isn’t going to detail to me how much
he is taking in and things of that nature or who he owes or what he don’t
owe. I mean I wasn’t confided in that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he talk to you about any of the problems he was having at
the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He had problems, you know, he had problems with his sister
because they were of the same nature. They were cat and dog fighters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he having any problems with the Federal Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, I assume he was. What they were I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then it is——<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What I mean to say, the Federal Government, you mean tax
problems?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am certain he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But I take it these were not things that he discussed with
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; you could be friendly, friendly and all that there, but you
don’t know. I mean they don’t tell you everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So what I am suggesting again or asking you again is if Jack was
not the kind of person who about certain matters which he considered personal
or important to himself wouldn’t talk about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t think he would discuss everything; as a matter
of fact I don’t think there is any individual who will tell you everything. I
don’t care who they are. I am certain, I know there are people, every little
thing, I mean there are certain things they keep to themselves. I would probably
say like you, you, or anybody else. They are not going to tell you everything
about their whereabouts, their notes, what they owe or what they don’t
owe or things of that nature. Everybody has a little secret or two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To put it another way, you wouldn’t describe Jack Ruby as
the kind of person who as a matter of his constitutional and emotional makeup
had to tell you everything he was doing? There are some people like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You mean would he tell me everything he was doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; there are some people who are the kind of people who
just somehow have to unload almost everything they are doing to other people.
Now Jack Ruby wasn’t that kind of person, was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Of what he thought you mean or his thinking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or his problems and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think he would; no. I don’t think he would unload
everything. I am certain there are things that he may have owed or certain
discussions he may have had that I am certain he wouldn’t discuss with me.
I am certain he didn’t want me to know everything there was to know, you
know, like anybody else would. There are certain things that an individual
keeps to themselves, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Go ahead, Mr. Hubert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I want to pass to the next day, which is to say Monday, the
25th, unless you can advise me now that there was nothing of significance
that occurred on the night of the 24th after you had met with Mr. Martin
and Mr. Barclay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You mean Sunday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Barclay wasn’t with me Sunday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There was another attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I didn’t say Barclay. I don’t remember his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t remember his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t see Tom Howard that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know if I did or not. I don’t remember if I saw him or
not that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go to bed early?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You see I can’t quote if I did or didn’t. I just don’t remember
if I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember what time you went to bed at Jim Martin’s
house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; it could have been 11, 12, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As I remember it, you said you met them at about 6 or 7. It
was dark in any case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You stayed about a half hour and you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You stayed about a half hour in the beer place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It may have been a half hour, it may have been an hour, I don’t
know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you left and went to Jim Martin’s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I believe we went to Jim Martin’s house. I think that I slept
there that first night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you meet anyone else that first night or speak to anyone else
that first night, that is November the 24th, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Are you talking about Friday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; November 24 was a Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; because I was wrapped up. I was wrapped up in the
courthouse all that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I mean to say after you left the beer parlor, which I think
you said was the TV Bar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You said you think you went to Jim Martin’s house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember if I met Tom Howard. I just don’t remember
the incident but I am almost certain that I went there to sleep.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You went to Jim Martin’s house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I am asking you is that prior to the <span class="locked">time——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Did we meet anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think so. I don’t remember but I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s come then to Monday morning.</p>

<p>What happened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Hubert, if you can let me interrupt you here before you get
to Monday morning.</p>

<p>When you met with Martin at the TV Bar, did you all talk about Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; there was discussion of it, that there and the events. Of
course, he asked me what happened after I got in there. I told him. This detective,
I guess, I just don’t remember who the man was, they interrogated me
and I told them the FBI interrogated me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Martin say anything to you about Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think so. I don’t remember. I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he indicate whether or not he had seen Jack while you were
being interrogated by the police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. If I remember right, I think he said he seen him at a glance
behind us, I think it was the same window that I saw. They had him in this
room there and I think there were three or four men there, something like that,
but there was this glass partition. In other words, you could see in. I think he
saw him. I am not sure but I think he saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Tom Howard at the TV Bar at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember. I remember there was Jim, there was this
other attorney, but I don’t remember if Tom was or not. In other words, I don’t
want to quote and say he was or wasn’t because I just don’t remember. He may
have been now. He may have been there. I just can’t think if he was or not
that night. He may have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember what your conversation was about at the TV
Bar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; of course, I told him—he asked me what happened, you
know. I told him I was interrogated by the local police and the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk about Jack’s defense?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now Saturday night, the 23d, you spent some time with Bill
Downey and Mike Barclay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you see them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. We were sitting at a bar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Which bar was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think we were in the Burgundy Room and then we went to
another one there and had I think either one or two beers and then we went
home. At least I went home anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was the other bar that you were in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It was very seldom I ever went there. I’m trying to think of
the name of it. It is a short name too, and I can’t even put my finger on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What street was it on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. On Fitzhugh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where is that located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It was on Fitzhugh. It runs off of, I think—down where Travis
is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Fitzhugh and Travis. I should know the name of it but I can’t
get it off my tongue. It is a short name too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that anywhere near Hall Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; this is uptown about I would probably say from the downtown
area I would imagine it would probably take you 10 minutes to get up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you mean the time you spent with Downey and Barclay—what
did you talk about with them that night, Saturday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. We talked about the occurrence of the shooting of the President,
that there. It was just a gloomy night. That is why I didn’t want to stay long.
I said I wanted to get home and they said they wanted to get home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you had a date to meet them at the Burgundy Room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I think I met them both by chance there. Now I am not
sure if I had a date to meet Bill or not, I don’t remember, but I think Mike just
walked in casually. I mean just happened to walk in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is Bill married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how about Mike?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Mike; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they know Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Who don’t know Jack in Dallas? They all knew him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk about Jack that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how much time would you say you spent with them
Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. We went to that bar, I would roughly say maybe a half hour
to three quarters of an hour, I would guess around that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That was at the Burgundy Room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; that is when we went to this other place and had a beer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All together, the time you spent at the Burgundy Room and the
other place on Fitzhugh how much time did you spend with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Maybe an hour and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then when you went home what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I went home and went to bed. I think I took a newspaper with
me, if I am not mistaken and went home and went to bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you get to bed at what you would consider an early hour
Saturday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I would say it was somewhere around 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much sleep do you normally get, when you go to bed, how
much sleep do you normally put in in a night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, of course, that would go according to what time you went
to bed, you know. It could be 4, 5, 6, 7 hours. I doubt if I ever stay in bed more
than 8 hours the most, if it ever happens that long, which is rare.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So would it be your estimate that on Sunday morning you arose
by 7 o’clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t think I got up that early.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If you didn’t get up that early, then would it have been because
you got to bed late that night after 11 or after midnight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I must have been home about 11 o’clock that night. I think
I read a little bit but I know I was in bed before 12. I think I was in the
apartment around 11. I got home around 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don’t think you got more than 8 hours sleep that night or
do you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I doubt if I got more than 8 hours sleep.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then I suggest to you that in all probability you got up on
Sunday morning before 8 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say around 8. Now mind you I got home 11 o’clock; so
I assume I got in bed maybe around 12. Now mind you it is not necessarily
that you fall asleep right away. Look, there is many a night that I toss and
turn for 4 or 5 hours and didn’t fall asleep, which is rare, but it has happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have trouble sleeping that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I mean when I went to sleep, when I fell asleep I slept
well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Hubert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now let’s see. I think we were at the point of Monday morning,
and I should like you to tell us what happened on Monday beginning with the
time you got up on Monday morning. I think you said you slept at Jim Martin’s
house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you do the next day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, I got up and I drove him to his office and I think from
there I <span class="locked">went——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In your car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I drove him down, and I dropped him off, and then I went
and had coffee. I don’t remember if it was around 9 or something like that. He
gets down about 9 in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did anything happen at the coffee shop?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; nothing particular, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did the people there talk about Ruby and your connection with
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Talk to me about him? No; they didn’t say anything, but they
knew, you know. The people who knew me knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But nobody said anything to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But the fact that you had been his roommate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; it was pretty silent. It was pretty silent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened the rest of the day? What did you do that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think I just roamed around in a fog that day, nothing in
particular.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t attempt to do your normal business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I wasn’t in any condition for business. I didn’t feel that
good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t remember seeing anybody that day at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am certain—who I saw I don’t remember but I am certain that
I seen people; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mentioned that sometime you saw Howard and you don’t
know whether you saw Howard the night before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It is very possible that I may have seen Howard the next day.
I may have seen him. Now where or when I don’t know, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you see him about? Can you tell us what the nature
of the conversation was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, I heard that Howard was getting the case, the Jack Ruby
case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you went to see him about what? Put it this way, did he
call for you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or did you just decide to go and see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he didn’t call for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You went to see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I saw him sometime during that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you tell us what it was about, what you talked about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t believe it was anything particular that we talked about
except I heard that he was getting the Jack Ruby case.</p>

<p>I don’t remember the particular conversation at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Perhaps you can tell us this then. Since he didn’t call upon
you, you called upon him, what was the purpose of your visiting him? To
find out the status of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Of me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To find out the status of Ruby’s defense, to see if you could
help, to see if you could throw light upon it, to find out what was going on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Everything in general was going on, you know. The photographers
were around and the newspapers were around, and I believe he was
down at the jailhouse. It is a conglomeration of things going on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you went to see him, and I suppose that was the purpose
of the visit, that was the purpose in mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; there was no purpose in mind. It was just going to see
him. When you say the purpose in mind—I was so mixed up myself I didn’t
know what was going on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am not trying to confuse you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. There was no general purpose in mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What you are saying to us is then that you just went to see him,
Mr. Howard, and that there was no purpose in mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No particular purpose in mind. I saw him. I saw Jim Martin
later on that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you excuse me a minute. Will you take over.</p>

<p>(Short recess taken.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I will simply ask you to remember everything that Mr. Hubert
has been in the practice of repeating before we proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. If I can remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To the effect that you are still under oath and we are continuing
under the same circumstances that we began.</p>

<p>I believe we were talking about Monday, and you had indicated that on
Monday you went to see Tom Howard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I saw him. I just don’t remember where. Monday there was
so much excitement going that when I say excitement, of the occurrence of
the day before, and with your photographers around town and your pressmen
and whatnot, you know, and the incoming of the FBI and things of that nature
there, you know, it was a crazy cycle, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk to any members of the Ruby family that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think I saw them that day. I can’t quote every instance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about his employees?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think I went up—let’s see, the club was closed Friday, Saturday
and Sunday, and I think they did open Monday, and I think I was up there
Monday night, if I am not mistaken, and, of course, going up there you had
all your photographers, especially the ones from Europe and various parts were
coming around. Of course, everybody wanted to see what the Carousel Club was.
You know, it was just a mixed-up thing, so many things were going on there,
and you were just roaming here and there, and, of course, people were questioning.
A lot of people wanted to take pictures of me and this thing here. It was
just a jammed-up, mixed-up day.</p>

<p>I know I saw Tom Howard that day. I don’t remember where I saw him,
if I called on him or what it was because so many things were going on there
and my mind was in a muddle even with that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The questioning that took place on Monday, did it have to do
with what you had done on Friday, Saturday and Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What Jack had done on Friday, Saturday or Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; there was nothing in general. I mean there was nothing
particular. I mean all my questionings—I mean all my questionings—I had
that Sunday you know, with the local detective or whoever the gentlemen
was, and the FBI man.</p>

<p>But Monday, when they wanted to know about Jack Ruby, they wanted to
see pictures of him. They wanted to see the club of his. They wanted to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
whatever they could get their hands on to see. They wanted to know this
about him and that about him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they want to know if he was involved with anybody else,
whether there could have been a plot or a conspiracy to kill Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am certain that probably would run through the minds of
everybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were they asking questions about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. They have asked me so many questions that I can’t even remember
to think of them, you know, because there were so many questions thrown at
you. And when they are throwing them at you, the general questions, they
wanted to see the club, they wanted to see pictures, who were the strippers,
this, that and whatnot. There was nothing precise except the curiosity of
the things they wanted to see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now when you talked with Howard, of course, Howard indicated
to you that you probably would be a witness for Jack, did he not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember the incident at that time. I don’t remember if
he said it or not because I would probably say it was a little too soon at that
time, the happenings, and I assume that Howard was kept pretty busy at the
beginning, probably going to see Jack Ruby and this. You see, people were
grabbing everybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When is the first time that you recall talking with anyone about
being a witness for Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. At that time it didn’t even enter my head. I wasn’t thinking
about that even. But as time went by, and I can’t specify just how much time
went by, I believe it was when Mr. Belli came into the case. See, I don’t remember
just how long it was from there until they got this Belli.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you this: After you heard that Jack had killed
Oswald, did you have any idea, did you think, why did he do it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I hadn’t the slightest idea. I couldn’t imagine why. I’ll tell
you why I say that. Because he never at any time ever gave me any indication
of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you since <span class="locked">then——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I just couldn’t picture this man doing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I couldn’t think. I couldn’t picture him being of this nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And there was nothing that he had done that you had seen up
to that point that would indicate that he had any thought about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, none whatsoever. As a matter of fact, he had never even
mentioned this Oswald to me during this occurrence even, but he had talked
about the President, and he had talked about Mrs. Kennedy and the children,
I don’t know how many times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But did you think he was any more disturbed than what <span class="locked">you——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He was plenty disturbed. He was plenty disturbed. The man
was crying. People have seen him, not only I, people have seen him crying.
As a matter of fact, one of the kids in the club one night when we sat in a
corner related he was crying and very, very disturbed. I believe it was one
afternoon he was in there, if I remember right, I think it was the colored boy,
Andrews, if I am not mistaken, I think said he saw him in a solemn condition
or whatever condition you want to call it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember when you were interviewed by Elmer Moore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where were you living at that time? Who were you staying
with at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t want to be quoted, but I think I was staying with Jean
Lauve then. I am not sure, but I think I was there at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did the interview take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. At the FBI building. I can’t think of the name of the building,
but the FBI people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The office of the Secret Service? Moore is with the Secret
Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, the Secret Service. I meant to say the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he call you and ask you to come down?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. He had left a message at the Carousel or he may have
been up there. As a matter of fact, I can even show you his card if you would
like to see it. I’ve still got that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What makes you think you were staying with the Lauves at that
point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think I was there. I’m not sure. I don’t remember just
where, but I think I was there at that time, because when Elmer Moore called
me, I just don’t remember how many days have elapsed by when he called me,
see. I think it was a few days that were elapsed by when he called me and I
think I may have been at the Lauves at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you return to work at any time before <span class="locked">Moore——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Return to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; before Moore called you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I hadn’t worked at all from this thing here up until I told you
I went to work the other day. If you want to classify me, I was just existing
here and there, that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Your employment up until the time that the President was
killed was with the Texas Postcard &amp; Novelty Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that your own company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I was classified as sales manager and partner, but with no say.
In other words, I had no money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who were the people, the backers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The backers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The people? A fellow by the name of Mort Seder and Ernest
St. Charles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to get involved in that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In the postcard business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, Ernest St. Charles found out—see, he had a card rack
like a lot of drug stores do or gift shops or things of that nature. He had found
out that this fellow wanted to sell his business because this was a minute business
with him because, he had another one, you know, which was much larger
or whatever, the household goods or something of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As I understand it, the Texas Postcard &amp; Novelty Co. was a going
business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Before Seder and St. Charles got involved in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; it was going. It was a going business. And he wanted
to get rid of this business, because I just don’t remember if he couldn’t handle
it or he couldn’t handle both of them, I think it was. And this business here,
he had to get rid of because it was deteriorating a bit because it wasn’t getting
the service. It wasn’t being handled for the service. In other words, his business
had slipped a certain amount.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Seder and St. Charles put up some money to acquire this
business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, they put up the money; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how much money did they put up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think they put up somewheres around $1,500 apiece, and I
think they took a note for $1,500. I think the business went for $3,000, if I can
remember right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What assets, what kind of assets did they acquire?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The cards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No office space?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no. See, he is in business in a little sort of a garage like in
the back of his house. In the back of his house he has got this sort of garage-like
thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who are you talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The fellow that had it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember what his name was?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I should remember his name. I can’t even think of his name
right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, maybe you will think of it later. Did Seder and St.
Charles have another business which they operated while <span class="locked">they——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; this business was a small little thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This was a sideline with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Just a little thing. It wasn’t even, you know—it was a small
little business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was Seder’s main business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Seder was a traveling man who sold men’s apparel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was St. Charles’ main business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. St. Charles, a drugstore.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you acquire the postcards and novelties from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The novelties, you see, there was a few novelties that he had
left over in this thing here, in this business here, which weren’t that good, and
I got rid of them at a loss, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you buy <span class="locked">any——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. There wasn’t that much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you buy any more novelties to supplant those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you buy those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Some I bought locally and some were bought out of town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And I take it the postcards, you had some source supplying the
postcards too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see Seder and St. Charles between the time that Jack
Ruby killed Oswald and the time that Elmer Moore talked with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think so. I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk to him by telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Seder and St. Charles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it then that you did not feel any obligation to report back
to them and tell them that you were not going to <span class="locked">be——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I was obligated, but the condition I felt, it was just a no-care
attitude any more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any sort of a draw from this postcard and novelty
company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was your draw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It was $75 a week, but I was drawing $61.45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you continue with your draw after <span class="locked">Jack——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You didn’t continue after Jack killed Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Nothing. I didn’t do anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, after Elmer Moore talked with you, you were then interviewed
some time later by two FBI agents, Mr. Rawlings and Glonek?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember where you were staying at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think I was staying with Lauve. The first approximately 10
days you know, I was just jumping around. But from there on in I was with
Lauve.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you stay with the Lauves?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I must have stayed with them, I would probably say approximately
around 5 weeks, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you leave Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I left Dallas, I think it was about the end of the first week, if I
remember right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. January.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And when did you return to Dallas?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It was the latter part of February. I think it was the last week
in February.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. While you were away from Dallas, where were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. At my sister’s.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is Freda Weisberg in New York?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was your occasion for returning to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I knew I had to be a witness because I was called on the first
bond hearing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That was your occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. For returning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I had to come back as a witness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In the bond hearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no. I was at the bond hearing before I went away. I think
I was at the first bond hearing. I don’t remember the date, but it was in December
sometime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that before or after you talked with Agents Rawlings and
Glonek that you appeared at the bond hearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That was before because I remember one day that I met one of
the agents. As a matter of fact, I was in the lobby of the Adolphus Hotel and
one of the agents hollered out, “Hi, George” and I turned around to see who it
was. It happened he was talking to some other agents and they were departing,
they were going home.</p>

<p>So I walked over to him and I asked him who would I notify if I wanted to,
who would I notify with the FBI that I was going to leave, that I wanted to go
home but I wanted them to know where I was going, and he mentioned, call Mr.
Clements.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the time of the first bond hearing, who was representing
Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Mr. Belli, Joe Tannenbaum—not Tannenbaum, Joe Tonahill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Anyone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Tom Howard was in it, but at that time he had no say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What happened that Howard was not given any say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, I am not sure how to relate it, but I think that Earl
Ruby, who was in Detroit then, was still in Detroit, spoke to some lawyer I
think in Chicago now. I think it was in Chicago, looking for a lawyer, a big
lawyer for Jack Ruby, and this lawyer to my knowledge, if I understand it right,
was quoted to get Mr. Belli.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how about Tonahill? How did Tonahill get in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. Tonahill, it seems, must have been a friend of
Belli. The relationship I don’t know, how they met or something of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you talked to Jack Ruby between the time you last saw
him that Sunday morning, the 24th of November, and now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In the jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you talked to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In jail, sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you talk with Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Various times, various times that Sheriff Decker would let me
up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see him before the bond hearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think I did, yes. I think so. I think I was up there. I mean
I can’t quote dates. I don’t even remember what the date of the bond hearing
was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember the first time you went up to see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you go up with anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, I went up alone. The reason for that, the reason I say I
went up alone is because nobody was up there, allowed up there, besides the
family and maybe very, very close friends because Sheriff Decker wouldn’t allow
anybody in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you spend with Jack that first time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember. You know, they have got a limitation on you.
I don’t remember just how long I talked to him. It wasn’t too long because they
let you know that you have got to go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Tell us what happened on this occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember what it was. First of all, I never talked to
him, I would never ask him what happened. I never talked about that. I
talked about anything else, and he was telling me, he said he wanted me to
look up certain people, the locales, tell them where he was and things like that
there, like sisters and Gordon McLendon which he asked me to go, whom I never
saw, never got to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was Jack’s relationship with Gordon McLendon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He just knew him. There was no relationship. He mentioned
a lot of names. He mentioned a lot of names to call them for the bond hearing.
I remember this. He was trying to get certain people to come to the bond hearing.
And he was rattling off a lot of big names. He rattled off the manager, I
don’t remember the name, from the Statler Hilton, anybody who was prominent,
such as I think the rabbi too if I am not mistaken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack appear to want to make bond at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. He didn’t discuss that, but I do know—I can’t
answer unless you want me to surmise something, guess on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Unless you have some information which leads you to think how
he felt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t have information on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever talk to the lawyers about whether they were really
serious about making bond?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think the lawyers were trying to get bond for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever talk with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I will tell you something. The lawyers didn’t discuss anything
with me at no time. They said, “George, we are going to use you as a
witness,” which I knew they wanted me for that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There came a time when Howard was no longer part of the case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He was part of the case; he was still part of the case when I
left, you know, but how big his say was I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you got back for the trial, however, he was not a part of
the case; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I think he was out of it before I got back. I am not sure,
but I think he was. I don’t think he was in the case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you returned for the trial, did you have occasion to talk
with Howard at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I saw him on certain occasions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever learn how he happened to get out of the case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, he got out of the case—I mean I really don’t know, but I
feel he got out of the case because he was—there was nothing, practically, to
speak of. I guess that is about the best way to describe him. He had no say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it something he had told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it something he had told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no. But he had no say any more. So I don’t know how
to classify his sitting there, just being there with no say any more, no nothing.
After all, when he originally started, he was the leadman, you know, and then
all the things materialized after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many times would you say you saw Jack Ruby in his jail
cell between the time that he shot Oswald and the time that he was tried, actually
went to trial, in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. How many times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. A guess?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. Your best estimate. Try to give some thought to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Let me see now. I would say maybe 10 or 15 times, I would
guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you notice any change in him over this period of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Sure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you first notice that he was changing; that there was
some change?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I saw him very few times, you know, previous to when I went
away, but his change—when I really noticed the change was after I came
back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This was in February?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. After the 18th of February?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. His voice was getting lower, and his head was hanging
down, and this is the way it was all the way up until the period, even after
the trial. I don’t know—I don’t know how to describe the words; you call
it deterioration or whatever runs through him; I don’t know. I would never
ask him anything like that, you know. I never spoke about anything like
that; anything but that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you notice a <span class="locked">change——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He had lost weight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He had lost weight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You noticed a change in his voice and something about the way
he carried his head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. And he lost weight. Of course, he quoted the Bible to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had he ever done that before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I mean to you; had he ever quoted from the Bible to you before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t think so, that I can remember of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What passages of the Bible was he quoting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He didn’t. He didn’t quote the passages, but he quoted that
he was reading the Bible. He didn’t quote any passages to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about his manner of speech other than the deepness of
his voice? Was there anything about the manner of his speech?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What do you mean; the manner of his speech?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Coherence, his ability to carry through on a topic of conversation.
Was he able to discuss topics as lucidly as he had discussed them previously
to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I’ll tell you, it got so that there was a hesitation. The
words were even silent. There was no speaking at times; just, you know, like,
you know. In other words, you know, there is very little of him I could see.
I was looking through this little glass. I couldn’t touch him or nothing. In
other words, instead of his wall being plaster, the thing was steel or iron, whatever
it was; see what I mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So you and he would be separated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, yes. I couldn’t even touch him. It was impossible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much of him could you see? We are going to have to get
this on the record. This is the problem.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In other words, I am standing up here and I am looking through
a glass about like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are looking through a little glass door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. And like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. A little glass window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. A window something like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Maybe 12 inches long and 8 inches high or something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Approximately. This is a guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At about eye level?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; it’s eye level. And under it are these perforations that
you have to talk to; holes. You know; perforated holes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Perforations in a door of some sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No door; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Just a wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Just a wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you could not see Jack other than through that window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. That is the only thing. It is just a <span class="locked">solid——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Steel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. A solid steel wall. At one end was a door, but that was solid,
too. In other words, when you looked at the door you might as well say it was
part of the wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This was the cell that Jack was kept in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; this was no cell. I don’t know what cell he was in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack stay in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He was brought in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This is a hallway. This was a narrow hallway. Apparently
they didn’t let you know the cell he was in. I never saw him in a cell. I have
never seen any cells. They’d bring him down in, and, of course, I can’t see
which way they are coming through. All I can say is they are coming this
way when I walk in, and this is this little hall, this little hallway. I can’t
see every bit of him, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And were these always the conditions under which you talked to
Jack, even before you left Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is the only way I have ever seen him, from beginning to
end. That is the only way I could ever see him. In other words, there was
no time that I could even touch him to shake his hand; nothing, because
there was nothing but a solid iron or steel, or whatever it was, wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You indicated that, of course, you noticed the most marked
change in him when you returned to Dallas, and I take it from that that, up
until the time you left Dallas, you didn’t notice any substantial changes in
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would probably say that there may have been a little—you
know, there may have been some change, but how much there was or how much;
I know this; I am certain within the man there would have to be some change,
because when I left already, how long has passed, maybe 5 or 6 weeks have
already passed by. Within the feelings of himself, which I don’t know, there
must have been some change within him, you know, which I sort of surmised.
Now, how much, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Has there ever been any time that you have talked to Jack
where he wasn’t coherent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Take that coherent word and use another phrase.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You use a phrase that is more appropriate to you. I take it you
have some idea of what I am suggesting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, when you say “coherent,” break it down to another word
and make it more simplified for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there anytime that you talked to him where it appeared
that he did not understand what you were saying to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I never noticed it, or even thought about it that way. I don’t
even know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there ever anytime when you would ask him a question
or say something to him and you would get back a response which did not
make any sense to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think so; not that I can recall. I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there anytime when you would ask Jack questions and he
would not be able to respond at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he was able to respond.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you at anytime talked with Jack about the events of
November 22, 23, and 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Never at anytime have I ever been at that jailhouse where
anything like that ever come up. I have never asked him, and I don’t think
anybody would to my knowledge, would ask him questions like that, because
this would be a hard subject to talk about. I would assume probably in the
condition that he was in and the locale, the placement of where he is in, of
what he is <span class="locked">in——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack ever indicate to you any fear; has he indicated any
fear to you in the times that you have talked to him since he shot Oswald?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He didn’t look fearful to me. Now I don’t know, you know.
I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What I want to do now is go through with you some documents.
I have got a series of photographs and other things here, and I want to ask
you some questions about them. I am going to hand you what has been marked
for identification as “Exhibit 5304-A,” which was used in the deposition of
Andrew Armstrong. That is a photograph, and I am going to hand it to you and
ask you if you recognize where that photograph was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am not familiar with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize anybody in that photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t. Where is it supposed to be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is what I am asking you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you look at the man who is tending bar? Do you recognize
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; it is a pretty shady picture to see his face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to hand you what has been marked as Exhibit
5304-B, which was also used in the deposition of Andrew Armstrong. That
is another photograph, and it shows a girl in a western costume standing on a
table. Do you recognize any of the people in that photograph, or do you recognize
where that photograph was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; never seen a place with elkhorns or whatever they are.
Is that a night club or a restaurant, that place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I was hoping you would be able to tell us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. I’ll tell you with a guess; it looks like a
restaurant, according to the curtains. That is what it looks like to me. I
don’t even know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to show you what has been marked as “Exhibit 5302,”
and unless I indicate to the contrary, all of these exhibits have been used in
the deposition of Andrew Armstrong. That is a photograph of a man. Do you
recognize that man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; is he a Dallas man? I don’t know that man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then I hand you Exhibit 5303-A, and I would like you to look
over that photograph. It is actually a series of about 12 small photos. Can
you tell me if you recognize anybody in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, I know it is the Carousel. These prints are pretty
small for my eyesight. I have seen him. I don’t know who he is, but I have
seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are indicating a fat, obese man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I have seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where have you seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. At the Carousel. I believe these occurred, I think, when they
were having—what do you call that now? I think when they were giving prizes
away, if I am not mistaken, on this particular time, and then sometimes they
would have on Friday or Saturday, Saturday night, amateur hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This would be amateur strippers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Once in a while—there was one girl who would always bring
up, after she got through she would always bring up one fellow to do the twist.
Now this wasn’t every night; only this one girl when she was on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Of Jack’s stripteasers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. As a matter of fact, I think I saw him do the twist once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That big, fat man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. But I can’t see the faces here. But I can’t help but recognize
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You can’t make out the faces in looking at those photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This is an M.C.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are indicating the center photograph at the top?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; this is an M.C. This looks like Tammi.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Tammi True?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The left-hand side in the third photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. As a matter of fact, are they all Tammi’s? Yes; that is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
Tammi. This girl is not clear enough for me to see. I am certain I know her,
but I can’t tell which one that is. That is about all I can see there. The
majority are all customers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it you do not recognize any of the customers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, because they ain’t looking this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now let me hand you Exhibit 5303-B and ask you if you recognize
any of the people in those photographs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is Tammi True.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The stripper that is shown in those photographs is Tammi True?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize any of the customers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This you can’t see at all. This you can’t see at all. I can’t tell
from this. This is no way of seeing; this is no way of seeing. This you can’t
see hardly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I hand you Exhibit 5303-C and ask you if you recognize any of the
people in those photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I know the stripper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is Kathy Kay, but I can’t recognize anybody from the
back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right; now, Exhibit 5303-D; do you recognize anybody in
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; that is Little Lynn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The stripper is Little Lynn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; as I know her. You called her Karen. What is her last
name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Bennett.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Bennett; yes. I don’t recognize anybody else here though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know Little Lynn before you began to live with Jack
Ruby the last time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember. All I know—see, I didn’t always come there
every night, you know, but I walked in one night and I saw her there and, of
course, I didn’t know who she was. She had already been there a few days, I
think, or something like that, which I didn’t know. This is the one that, I guess
you probably know, that came in with that gun with no firing pin. I guess you
heard about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It was at the trial, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or one of the hearings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; she come in with this gun, which I believe didn’t have a
firing pin, and, of course, there was no ammunition, but it was a blank gun. According
to what I have heard around the station there, that she had switched
bags and was in a hurry or something like that, and she didn’t even know the
gun was in there, according to what I have heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You haven’t talked to her about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no. When that happened, she was being searched just as
you walk into the courtroom, and that is where they got her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, would you look at Exhibit 5303-E and tell me if you recognize
anybody in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I know the stripper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Joy Dale. The people, no. They are all facing the other
way. That is why I can’t recognize anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now look at Exhibit 5303-F and tell me if you recognize
anybody in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This is Kathy Kay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The stripper is Kathy Kay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Kathy Kay, and this is Joy on this side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Joy Dale on the right-hand side, a stripper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And Kathy Kay on the left?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This is that big heavy-set fellow which I can tell. I don’t
know his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The top picture in the center?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. And the cocktail waitress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who is the cocktail waitress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Bonnie something. I don’t know her last name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is she shown in the picture in the lower right-hand side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Bonnie. I don’t know her last name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you don’t recognize anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Let me see. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now I hand you Exhibit 5303-G. Do you recognize anybody in
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This is Kathy Kay, the stripper. Excuse me, not Kathy Kay.
This is Tammi True. That is an error. But I can’t see no faces there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me hand you Exhibit 5303-H. Other than the strippers, do
you recognize any of the other people in those pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You don’t want the strippers, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am looking for the face here but I can’t see it. This one
I can’t see the face well. Whether I know him or not, I don’t think so but I just
can’t see their face well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now Exhibit 5303-I, other than the stripper and the fat man
who is shown there, do you recognize any of the people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, Exhibit 5303-J, other than the entertainers, do you
recognize any of the people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I can tell that this is Tammi True from the back. No, no, I
don’t. The M.C. I don’t know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who is the M.C.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t even know his name. He was only there a short while,
this particular one here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me give you Exhibit 5303-K.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Where did you get this good picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize any of the people shown there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is the cocktail waitress. I can’t distinguished who it is.
This sort of looks like Jack, but I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are pointing <span class="locked">to——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. But I am not sure. I’ll tell you, I am looking at the head because
it is sort of baldish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But the people in the foreground in that picture, you don’t
recognize any of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, Exhibit 5303-L. Other than Jack Ruby, do you recognize
anybody in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me hand you Exhibit 5300-A and ask you if you recognize any
of the people in that picture other than Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Kathy Kay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is the blonde on Jack Ruby’s right, or left as you look at
the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This is a cocktail waitress. Her name is Alice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The girl on Jack Ruby’s left, Jack’s left but the right side of
the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Alice, I don’t remember her last name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long had Alice worked for Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say on and off for maybe a year and a half or two,
but I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack date Alice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Alice every solicit up at Jack’s apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think she came there once for I think it was a job interference.
I think for some reason, I don’t know what it was because I didn’t stay, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
she was there once. She came there one afternoon. I don’t know what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me hand you Exhibit 5301-D. Do you recognize any of the
girls in that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This is Joy Dale on the left and this is Little Lynn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On the right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is on the right of the picture as you look at the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes: Little Lynn on the right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What I am going to do, Mr. Senator, I am going to hand you
a set of photographs, 5306-A and 5306-B. These photographs are pictures of
memoranda that were made at one time or another. Let me ask you to look
at those. First, I will ask you a general question about these memoranda.</p>

<p>Do you ever recall Jack Ruby having any memoranda pads similar to those
that are shown in those photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; with him, everything went on a piece of paper, it don’t
matter what type it was. He would keep his papers and notes, everything
else like he kept his money, all over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he keep some of his papers and notes at home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It could be at the office or at home because he wasn’t immaculate
in where he kept things, things of that nature there. It would lay here, lay
there, lay in the office, wherever it laid. That is the way he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have any memoranda pads such as this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not that I know of. I can’t say yes or no, but not to my
knowledge that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have occasion to take messages for him at home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Very seldom if the phone rang and all I would do is write it on
whatever piece of paper it might be. No particular paper, sometimes even on a
newspaper, whatever it was, whatever is close by. I have seen those go on
pieces of paper this big even, you know. It is just no particular type piece of
paper with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know who Nancy Barker might have been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; it could have been maybe somebody calling for a job.
I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know who Joyce Harvey was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know who Linda Bumwalt was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Emma Ship?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; the only thing possibly could happen, I may know somebody
by face maybe but not by name. This could be. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know Jean Bordon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know Archie Esquavill? Did you ever hear of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear of a person named T. E. Smith?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now I am going to hand you a series of photographs which are
marked Exhibits 5305-A to 5305-S. These are photographs of a notebook which
had a cover which said “Aladdin,” and I ask you first of all if you have ever
seen this Aladdin notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think I have. I mean, his things that he kept in his
pocket, I assume that is it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you look through those photographs and look through
all of them, and I am going to ask you a general question whether you recognize
that notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. So far this stuff I have never seen, though I do know he had
books, you know, notebooks, but I have never seen the insides of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you able to read what is on those pages?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Some yes and some no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I will ask you the question again: Do you ever recall having
seen this particular notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I know he had a book. Now, I don’t know about the cover, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
I know he had a book. As a matter of fact, I think he had two or three of
them. But I am not sure of the cover part of it, but I do know that he had a
notebook of some sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to hand you Exhibit 5305-B, which purports to be a
photograph of a page of that notebook. Can you read the names on there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Leonard, isn’t that right? That is Leonard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I just want to know if you have difficulty reading them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Frank Barber.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it you do have some difficulty reading the names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Frank Bourber or Barber.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me read the names to you and ask you if you recognize any
of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. May I make this suggestion?</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I know some of the names on there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize the handwriting on that page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize Jack Ruby’s handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It probably could be Jack’s, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But would you recognize Jack’s handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think, offhand, I would, but I assume these probably are
Jack’s handwritings, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you, did you know Frank Barber?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear Jack speak or did you know Milt Jaffe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know of any friend Jack had named Barney?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Pauline?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know Pauline Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Now, you may ask me some names. I may know the face but
I may not recognize the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know any people that worked at the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, Pauline Hall; yes, I do. I am glad you mentioned that.
Pauline worked at times at the Vegas Club, if that is her last name. I am not
sure. Now, I know her first name was Pauline, so it might be Pauline Hall,
if that is her last name, but she worked at the Vegas Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You say she worked there at times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; not steady. I wouldn’t say she worked there steady.
There were times I walked in there with Jack at night on a weekend I have
seen her working, and then there are other times I haven’t seen her working.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know Billy Brook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Bobbie Patterson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think I have heard of that name, but I can’t think who it is.
I think I have heard of that name. I think I have heard of that name Bobbie
Patterson, but I can’t refresh my mind. It seems I have heard that name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Howard Foster?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Sammy Tucker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. Would it be easier, you know, what you want to do, would
it be easier if I could pick up the ones I knew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If you could read them. Could you go through there and pick
out the ones you know, and indicate to me if there are any on there you can’t
read.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What is this? Is this Goody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It looks like Grady to me, but I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Fred Fillman, I don’t know who he is. You want me to sound
out the names, don’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Just comment on the ones you recognize.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What does this say? It looks like Rita.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It looks like Ruth Shay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had better make reference to the document you are talking
about. Let the record show the comments of the witness are with reference to
Exhibit 5305-F.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Here is one that says Pauline. That may be Pauline Hall, I
don’t know. I have heard that name. I don’t know who she is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What name are you talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Tex DeLacy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Take a look at 5305-G and tell me if you recognize the name
R. T. Brown on there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t know who that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me hand you 5305-H.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. There is no other names on there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is right. 5305-H, do you recognize any of the names on
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What is that, Joseph Rossi?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know him. The rest are just figurations here, numbers
or moneys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Take a look at 5305-I. There is the name Tom Palmer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Tom Palmer, I think he is the booking agent in Dallas. In other
words, he books. Not the booking agent. I have got to find out how to classify
him now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Tell us what he does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He is with, I think he is with AGVA.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And that is the American Guild of Variety Artists?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. I believe he has an office in Dallas. Let me see how he is
classified. How do you classify him? I guess he has something to do with the
acts, you know, the working hours, and the pay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Of the entertainers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you met Tom Palmer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where have you met him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have seen him in the Carousel, or occasionally on the street,
or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how many different occasions would you say you have
met him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, I have seen him maybe a dozen times or so, maybe more.
I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you first meet him through Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; because when he came up there, he always went to Jack,
you know. I mean, he had no occasion to come to me or anything of that nature,
but he always came to Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know of any particular dealings Jack had with him in
the few weeks before Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me hand you Exhibit 5305-J, and I will ask you if you
recognize any of the names on there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What is this, Grace Wilkins, the first one? Is that what that
says? I don’t know her, but is that what it says?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It looks like Grace Wilkins; yes. Do you recognize that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. And Woodruff, I don’t know who that is. But, mind you,
I want you to bear in mind I may know these people and don’t know the names.
I may know them if I see their face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. J. B. Gruber, I don’t know who he is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I will hand you Exhibit 5305-K and ask you if you recognize any
of the names on there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. KLIF radio station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. KLIF?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. I have heard of the name Harrigan. I don’t know if Harrigan
is KLIF, I am not sure. It says diskjockey. I knew he was something
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you met him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think I have ever met him, but I have heard of that name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack talk to you about him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know how I heard of it. Very possibly he may have,
but I have heard the name. I know I have heard the name before. I don’t
know who this other is. I believe it says Chuck Dunnaway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I am not familiar with these. I am not familiar with these.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know Alex Gruber?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. As I say, I may know him by face, but I am not familiar
with the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to hand you Exhibit 5305-M and ask you if you
recognize the names on there. I might state for the record that 5305-L is a
duplicate of 5305-K, and that is why I didn’t hand it to the witness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Here it says Nick Turman. The reason I say that, I happen to
know somebody by the name of Buddy Turman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who is Buddy Turman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Buddy Turman, I believe, is out on the West Coast. He used
to be the light heavyweight or heavyweight champion of Texas, a real fine fellow.
That is why I say I don’t know Nick.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, was he a friend of Jack’s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, he was of Jack’s sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you meet Turman through Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Through Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know if I met Turman through Jack. No, I met him
some other place. I met him some other place. I can’t think where I met him,
but I didn’t meet him through Jack, but I have seen him at Jack’s place. As a
matter of fact, he has helped Jack every now and then. This Nick Turman, I
don’t know if this is related to him or what it is. I am not familiar with the
name Nick. You have got a Norma here, and I know a name Norma, and I
can’t place it; I wonder if this is somebody who ever worked for him, Norma.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Buddy Turman have any particular dealings, that you
know of, with Jack Ruby in the last month or so <span class="locked">before——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, Buddy has been gone quite a while. He went to the West
Coast. As a matter of fact, the last time I saw Buddy he said he was going to
the West Coast to train, because from there—now I don’t know if it ever materialized—from
there he was going to England to fight. I can’t think of that
heavyweight fighter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Bruce Wilcox?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. Name a couple more. This one fighter didn’t fight too long
ago. You may have seen him on TV. He is the type that fights very awkward,
and sort of a slap, like. Do you remember who that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No, I don’t. Now, did Jack Ruby have an interest in prizefighting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I would say that he liked the fights. He liked to watch
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But he never expressed any particular interest to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, but he liked to watch the fights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he ever tell you about any interest he had in the fight game
when he was a younger man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I know that he used to carry Barney Ross’ bag around. How
young he was or what age, in Chicago, I don’t remember. But I know it was as
a youngster.</p>

<p>I assume this first name, Tammi, is Tammi True, and I assume the other one
is Little Lynn; right? These are only first names. This says Tammi, so I
assume that must be Tammi True, and Lynn, that might be Little Lynn.</p>

<p>Wait; I haven’t gone through the rest. There is a Dick Lenard there, and
I think this man is a booking agency. I think he is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. For entertainers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, if it is the same Dick Lenard. I don’t know the rest of
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I will hand you what has been marked as Exhibit 5305-N, and
ask you to look at the names on there and tell us if you recognize any of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; this is a Murray Wynn, who owns, I assume, because it
says The Smoker’s Lounge, and I know the place, but I never knew his last
name. I assume it is the right one. He owns a tobacco and pipe store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What dealings did Jack have with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. None that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Jack didn’t smoke, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. He probably just met him like he meets a lot of people,
I assume. I have heard of this Grant Koch. I have heard of the name, but
I don’t know who he is. It is a name I remember hearing at one time or another;
and I don’t know who this Kierney Aikens is. I don’t know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. A-i-k-e-n-s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. A-i-k-e-n. I don’t who he is. What does this say here? This
is pretty hard to read. Do you see this one right here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It looks like Donald Wiley. Do you recognize that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I will read you the other names on here. Pauline Foch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Etheridge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Ray Hawkins?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Sue Blake?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t know her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am not going to hand you the next exhibit, which is 5305-O,
because there are no names written on there of any persons. And I am not
going to hand you Exhibit 5305-P. I will take that back. I will hand you that.
There is a name “Bishop” written there. Does that name mean anything to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think I have heard of the name, but I don’t know who it is. I
don’t know what that is. I believe I have somewheres heard of that name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I am going to read to you from Exhibit 5305-Q, and tell
me if you recognize any of these names. Monte?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mike Shore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Mike Shore? Is there an address or something that goes with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Dr. Uhlevitch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Does it say what he is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Is he local, Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I presume so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What is the exchange?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It doesn’t give an exchange, just the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Uhlevitch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Stanley Kaufman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; he is a lawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you met him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I have never met him, but I know who he is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you talked to Jack about him or has Jack talked to you
about him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he is, I believe, a civil attorney, and I know that Jack has
always called him for conferences of some nature or another, whatever it may
be, but I <span class="locked">wasn’t——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he a personal friend of Jack’s?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I assume that he has known Jack for some time. Now, how
personal, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any idea whether Jack was as close to Kaufman
as you were to Jim Martin, for example?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know, but I know that—as a matter of fact, even now
during the trial, trying to get the new trial now, I know that they keep in contact
with Kaufman. So I don’t know what you want to actually call close, you
know. I can’t tell you what close is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about John Hilt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I never heard of that name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Dick Shepard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t know that, either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Abe Klinman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Abe Klinman is a CPA. I know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he do work for Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He has done some work for Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Jerry Wilson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know that name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mike Riaf?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Tom Palmer’s name is on here, but you have talked about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Ed Pullman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Ed Pullman; yes. Ed Pullman; his wife had worked for Jack
for a short spell as a cocktail waitress. She is an elderly woman. Ed Pullman,
he is a man who thinks up gadgets, you know. I don’t know how to describe it.
He is an idea man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. A promoter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Things that he makes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. An inventor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; in that classification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did Jack have any business dealings with Ed Pullman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The only thing is—no; no business dealings. The only thing
is he had a show once, Ed Pullman, like a market show—you know what I mean,
sort of an exhibit like where people come to look—exhibits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of things did he exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Things that he had made, to show and see what he could do
with them. In other words, he wasn’t manufacturing them, but he had already
made these things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was he exhibiting these items?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. At a place called Market Hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Ed <span class="locked">Pullman——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Ed Pullman exhibited a thing for him that Jack was trying to
promote.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This is what they call—what do they call the little thing? It
is a little twistaboard. It is a little square twistaboard, and you get on it and
it moves around like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It is a weight reducer, like?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; a twister.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, how long had Jack Ruby been promoting this twistboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It never came to the promotion part. I would assume that he
fooled around with it for about a month, I guess, something like that, as a rough
guess. In other words, he was going to buy them. I think somebody was going
to make them for him, and he was going to try and sell them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And for a month, what would this month cover, from the 1st
of November to the time that he shot Oswald, or before the 1st of November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; it was either September or October, somewheres in there.
I will have to take it to the extension of these 2 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did it fall through somewhere along the line? Did he lose
interest in it, or something?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It never materialized. In other words, look, he had competition
because there was one already out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who designed this twistboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think it was manufactured by somebody in, I don’t know
the name of the place, in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who else was associated with Jack in the twistboard project?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Nobody. This is something that never really got off the ground.
See, I think Jack had—what was it—maybe four or five or six dozen of the
things. I just don’t remember. But it never got off the ground.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He bought these, and then what was he going to do with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He was going to have them manufactured to resell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he buy them from some place other than Fort Worth, or
from Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am not sure whether he bought them from Fort Worth or
some place else. I don’t know just where he got them from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of material were they made out of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It was a compressed—I don’t know what you would call it—it
was a compressed thing. In other words, let me say that it was about this
size here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are indicating about a foot long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Approximately about a foot square.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. A foot square?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Approximately about a foot square, and on the bottom of it—this
is a compressed thing. I don’t know if you call it a compressed board,
or what you call it. There was a compression. Then on the bottom of it
it had, I believe, a steel roller with ballbearings in it, on the bottom, so the
thing could revolve. Under that was another piece of staple, where it was
staple. In other words, it had to hold the weight of an individual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This was something that you would lean up against?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no. It was on the floor, and you just got on it like that,
and you go—I am not a good exhibit for a twister.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In other words, you would stand on this board?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, you would stand on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You wouldn’t put it up against your back, or anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You would stand on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Strictly stand on it, and it was a novelty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And the bottom part would remain stationary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And the other part would swivel as you moved on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is right. In other words, instead of going in the twist,
this thing did it for you. In other words, you revolved and, of course, this
was classified as an exerciser, or something of that nature. As I say, it never
got off the ground.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To your knowledge, nobody else was involved in the promotion
of it with Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; definitely not; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about John Newman? Do you recognize that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. John Newman works for the Herald or the Times, the Herald or
the News. He works for either the Dallas Morning News—I forgot now—or
the Herald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How do you happen to know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I met him on occasion when Jack used to go up there to place
an ad once in a while, when I was living with him in 1962, you know, I went
up there with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever see Newman at the Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know if I have or not. I just don’t remember. I
couldn’t say yes or couldn’t say no. I just don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to read to you the names that are on Exhibit 5305-R.
Bill Petty. Do you recognize that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think I have heard of that name, but don’t know who it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Bill Cantrell?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Gladys?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Gladys who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is all it says.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. J. B. Herred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mrs. Oscar Newman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to read to you the names that are on Exhibit 5305-S.
Gloria Rettig?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Little Lynn you have mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Vicky Williams?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Vicky Williams; I don’t know that name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That concludes the photographs that pertain to the Aladdin
notebook. I am going to hand you what has been marked for identification as
Exhibit 5309-A, and this is a Xeroxed copy of another notebook that has on
the front cover, “This is a Robinson reminder. Jot it down. Do It. Tear it.
Live notes only.”</p>

<p>I am going to hand you this and ask you to tell me, first of all, go through it
and tell me if you remember ever seeing that notebook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think I have seen the cover of this. These are little tear
things out, aren’t they, you tear them out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are referring to what appears to be perforated segments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Isn’t that what it is? That is what it looks like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On the front page. I believe that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have heard of the name Sue Pepper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you are looking at the first page of that notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you are going to identify the names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have heard of the name. I don’t know who it is. A lot of
the names I heard, but I just don’t know who they are. Does this say Jack
Hanover? This is a little hard to read.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yanover, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Carroll Walker I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know a Jack Hanover?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I don’t know the balance of these in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize the handwriting on that page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think it is Jack’s. I assume it is. I am not sure, but I assume
it is. It all looks like the same. I have seen the cover of a book like this. Now,
the insides of it I have never seen, but I think I have seen it on him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, you are turning to the next page. Does that have a small
numeral down at the bottom of that page? It has numeral 3. It is actually the
second page on which there is any writing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Wally what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that Rack—R-a-c-k? Do you know a Wally Rack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know anything about the Doctors Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The Doctors Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I never knew there was a Doctors Club in Dallas. What is
Linda’s last name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It looks <span class="locked">like——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Kuhox?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Kuhox.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does anything like that ring a bell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I don’t know anybody here. He has some first names here.
I don’t know what they mean. Brenda and Angie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize any of those first names?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let’s turn to the page that is numbered 4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I know Bill Willis. Bill Willis was the drummer in the band
at the Carousel Club. Tom Palmer is here again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You talked about him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. Kathy Kay is a stripper. Andy is the boy. I assume that
is Andy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Andy Armstrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. I assume the first name Kathy is Kathy Kay; right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is what I think it is anyhow. I don’t know. This girl, I
never knew her last name, but this could have been a former stripper of some
time back, this Lauri.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Lauri?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does Lauri have a last name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. There is a last name here, but I don’t know who.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is the last name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Womack, W-o-m-a-c-k. I knew a Lauri, I think, that was a
stripper for him for a while. I think it was last summer if I am not mistaken,
or something like that. Russ Knight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. K-n-i-g-h-t?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He is with a radio station, but I can’t think which one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you met him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I knew Russ.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where have you met him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have met him—I have seen him at the bowling alley when we
used to go up there at night. I have seen him on rare occasions when he would
come down to the Carousel. He was, I guess you would call him, a disc jockey.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did you bowl with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Sometimes people—very seldom, mind you, very seldom—but
sometimes people from the club which was very seldom. As a matter of fact,
I only bowled one time, I believe. It wears me out particularly. But very seldom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack bowl frequently?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he bowl more than you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Maybe a little more. I’ll tell you, this particular alley is a tremendous
place in Dallas, but we always went up there to eat, on occasions, when
we did go. It was always we would go up there to eat. They had a big
restaurant there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What eating places did Jack frequent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. A lot of times when he went out, the majority of the times when
he went out I wasn’t with him when he went out to eat. But he has been to—of
course, it probably pertains to the time of day or night, you know, but he ate in the
waffle shops, he ate at—wait; it will come to me in a minute. There is a couple
on Commerce just above the Adolphus Hotel. What in the world is the name of
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The Egyptian Lounge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He has ate at the Egyptian Lounge, but there is a couple in the
downtown area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That he ate at regularly, I take it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It is not, particularly. I can’t say regularly. I don’t know.
Let me say he just varies the place. He may want to try certain foods, I don’t
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack visit the Dallas Cabana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Dallas Cabana? What in the world is the Dallas Cabana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The Cabana Motel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The Cabana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; Jack has been down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does he have friends there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know if he has friends there or not. He certainly probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
does know some people there. Yes; there is one chap he knew there that
I know for sure, and I think he was the assistant, if he is still there, was the
assistant manager. There is Ralph Paul. Of course, I am certain you have
heard of his name before, Ralph Paul.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; Ralph we talked about earlier. How often would Jack
see Ralph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Ralph would come up, I would probably say he would probably
come up maybe two or three times a week, about like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would they telephone each other during the week also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would probably say they have. I mean, not that I was always
around when he did, if he did telephone him, but I am certain there were
telephone calls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever have any occasion to telephone Ralph Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Did I ever have occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I called him, yes; I called him a couple of times. The reason
I called him, I had no car, I had to go down and see him once in a while, a free
lunch. He has got this place in Arlington, if you know where Arlington is,
called the Bullpen. It is one of these barbecue places.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk to Ralph Paul on the weekend of the 22d, 23d, and
24th of November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. By phone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about in person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It may have been possible that I may have seen him. I just
don’t recall if I have seen him on that weekend. I can’t say yes or no, but it may
have been possible that I may have seen him at the club. Oh, no; the club
wasn’t even open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This was after the President was killed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; no, I don’t think I did. I don’t think I have seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You seem to have some recollection, though, that you might
have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; let’s see. No; I saw him, I think the first time I saw him
was, it may have been, I would say within the week. I can’t name a date or a
day. But I will say within the week after the Ruby shooting up at the Carousel.
That is about the best that I can recollect on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall talking to Little Lynn at any time on Friday,
Saturday, or Sunday, November 22, 23, or 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I didn’t even see her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know her husband?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; but I have seen him—if it is her husband—sort of a blond.
I will tell you where I have seen him. I saw him the day of that trial when
she was carrying that gun, he come up with her, if it is her husband or if it is
her boy friend, I don’t know what.</p>

<p>The reason I say that, because to the best of my knowledge I don’t even know
if she wore a marriage band. But I have seen him. I think he is sort of a
blondish-haired fellow. I don’t even know his name. I am through with this.
Do you want the next page, page 6?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. There is a Joe Slayton here. Of course, Joe Slayton—this Joe
Slayton, I know him by sight but I don’t know him by conversation. Wally
Weston, he was an MC of his. I know this guy only by reading about him, Earl
Wilson, the New York Post. I don’t know him. I believe this Tony Turner
here, this name is a stripper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. T-o-n-i?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. T-o-n-y it says here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You think that is a stripper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Tony Turner is T-o-n-i. I think that is how she spells her name.
This says Tony, T-o-n-y, Turner. It could be a man. I don’t know. I am only
guessing at this one here. Tammi True. I know her. This is a stripper. Then
there is Kay here. I don’t know if that is Kathy Kay, or what it is. That is all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
I know on this one. One here says Porter. I don’t know what that is. I don’t
know what that means, if that is a porter, or what it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don’t know, either. How about page 7? Let me just read
off the names and see if you recognize them. Phil Olian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Wendy Knight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Wanda?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Just a girl’s name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think, I am not sure now; I think he had a cocktail waitress
by the name of Wanda, if I am not mistaken, at one time. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Janice Anderson</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Ann Petta?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know of any acquaintances Jack had in Mexico City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In Mexico City. Did you know of any acquaintances he had
in Mexico City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know of any trips that Jack took?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. To Mexico City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not while I knew him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know of any foreign trips that he has taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, but I have heard at some time that he went to Cuba. Now,
that is before my relation with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you hear this from Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I have heard it, I don’t know if I read it in the newspapers
or where I read it, but I know I heard it at one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack ever talk to you about Cuba at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about someone named Billie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. B-i-l-l-i-e?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Is that a man or a woman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Is there a telephone number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. FE 9-7914? Toni Rebel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think that is a stripper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Bill Towney? Bill Towney, WH 2-8129?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Bill Towney?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Shirley Nole?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Margo?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Let me place this Margo. This is a cocktail waitress that he
had, if it is here. It is a cocktail waitress that he had at one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Kitty Keel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mary Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It sounds like the one from Hollywood. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Ethel A. Piersol?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Gail Thompson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Sam George?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Margie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Margie was a cocktail waitress that he had, if it is the same one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Peggy Steel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Peggy Steel was a stripper that he had at one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. John M. Crawford?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Don’t know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This man has an address, Huntsville State Penitentiary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear of any friends Jack had there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, and I don’t want to hear of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Linda?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think Linda could have been a cocktail waitress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Avrum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Never heard of that name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Sherry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am trying to figure if Sherry was a stripper. I am not sure.
I can’t make it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Henry Segel? This man is from Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I wouldn’t know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Roy Pike?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mickey Ryan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Mickey Ryan, I know Mickey Ryan. Of course, Mickey Ryan
lives in California. He is in California. Mickey Ryan used to sell cars, and
he worked, the last job I think he worked at, he worked at a club for a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, a private club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You say he is in California or from California?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. From California, and back there. He is back in California.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But he was in Dallas at the time that the President was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know if he was, before or after. No, I don’t really
know. He may have been, now. I think he was after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did he happen to return to California?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. He said he was going back to California. I
met him one day, and he said he was going back to California. Now, why, I
don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you meet him before you went to New York to live with
your sister?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, sure; yes. I never same him after I come back. I saw him
last year. It could have been, it may have been November or December. I
think it may have been December.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So some time <span class="locked">after——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think the last time I saw him was after the incident, if I
remember right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And at that time, and this was before you left New York to live
with your sister?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or left Dallas to live with your sister?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I think it was in December the last time I saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He told you at that time he was moving to California?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He said he was going back to California.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he tell you why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; no particular reason why.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know what acquaintanceship or relationship he had with
Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. As a friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they have any business dealings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he ever work for Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He may have helped him a little bit. Now, I am not sure. I
think he helped him for a very short while in the Carousel, if I remember, but
it was a very short while. Now, how long it was, I don’t know. It was just a
short while, though, I think he helped him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Lisa Starling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I knew a girl by the name of Lisa, and I can’t place it. I am not
familiar with the last name. I am trying to figure who, a Lisa I knew. Now, I
knew a Lisa Lynn. Lisa Land I think it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But Gail Hall, Monroe, La.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack ever talk about any friends he had in Louisiana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Gail Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Is there a city?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Monroe, La.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have heard him mention Monroe, La.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In what connection have you heard him mention Monroe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think he met a girl once in Dallas that came from Monroe.
Now, if this is the girl or not, I am not sure. I think he met a girl. I am not
sure if he met her at the club, or where it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What about H. G. Tiger?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Tiger?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. E. Fletcher, F-l-e-t-c-h-e-r?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. E. Fletcher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Is there an address or something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. 40 Central Park, something or other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. 40 Central Park?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Central Park, and I don’t know what.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. There is a fellow I knew by the name of Ernie
Fletcher. I don’t know E. Fletcher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that a friend of Jack Ruby? Does he know Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. I mean, I have never seen him with Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know him in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I knew him in Dallas, yes. I have seen him in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did he do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I haven’t seen him in a long, long time, because the last I heard,
I think he was living in New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did he do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I never knew what he did. He was a promoter, but what, I
don’t know. I think he was an oil promoter or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Darrell Williams?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, on page 9 of this particular notebook that we have been
looking at, there is the name Vivian, Statler Barbershop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; there is a manicurist there by the name of Vivian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack frequent the Statler Barbershop?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. The barbershop he frequented the most was a
place in another section of town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Loma Alto.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It may have been called the Loma Alto?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; it is two words, the Loma Alto section.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What general part of Dallas is that, northeast, southwest, Love
Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Let me say it was on the way up to that way, Love Field.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Towards Love Field from downtown Dallas?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. From downtown. I tell you, the best way I can describe it to
you is it ran off of—I have got a good memory, haven’t I? You are writing that
down, too? I can’t think of the name of the street. I’ll tell you why he went
to this barbershop, which I never knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. When the barber cuts his hair, he doesn’t like clippers. He won’t
let them use a clipper. He wants everything by hand, and he could probably
drive a barber crazy the way he wants his hair cut. To my knowledge, I don’t
think he lets a barber shave. You know how the barber shaves you back here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He won’t let him shave the back of his neck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You know why? I’ll tell you why. Because he grows hair too
fast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is what Jack told you, that your hair grows too fast when
it is shaved off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; you know how some of the hairs will grow in the rear
of a person, like mine, I have got a few, the barber will shave them off. He
wants them clipped off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So he requires the back of his neck to be clipped rather than
shaved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; now, he has got a barber, he has got this barber who
knows just what to do with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Jack concerned about baldness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, you should only know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Tell us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He used to drive me crazy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, he would have these treatments. I don’t know the name
of the place where he got these treatments, and he had the stuff, you know,
they’d rub into his head, whatever this medication. I don’t know what the stuff
was, you know.</p>

<p>I have always seen him use it, whatever it was, and he would rub it into
his head. He spent 45 minutes under a shower when he was really working
with the stuff, and he would rub it into his head. He was always combing
his hair all the time, what little was left, but he couldn’t stand being bald.</p>

<p>He used to comment, “How does my hair look; how does my hair look?”.
And it was really funny. I used to laugh, but he would get mad when I
laughed at him. But he was very, very particular about his hair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had he been this way all the time that you knew him, or was
this something that had come on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; this is, of course, as long as, you knew, as long as I have
known him. Actually, I can’t say as long as I have known him, but as long as
I have been around him. Oh, man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And he actually had some treatments for his hair, didn’t he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, sure, sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were these called trichology treatments, or something like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know the nature of the word they used.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he go to some practitioner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who worked on his head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; he went to somebody, he actually went. And I believe
he picked up all his medication from him, too. They came in plastic tubes, a
little vial like. I would probably say these tubes would hold approximately
maybe about half a pint. He had two different types whatever they were;
one was wash and one was rinse, or what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And he would use these on his head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And was this a daily thing that he did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have any particular ritual, any period of time of the
day that he would do this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; it was just whatever time, not particularly. It could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
be in the morning, but I would say it was about every day, once a day some time,
you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So when you told us yesterday, I believe it was, that Jack would
spend 45 minutes in the bathroom, or something like that, he was very slow
getting up in the morning, was this part of the procedure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know if he did it that day or not. I don’t remember
if he did it that way, but I tell you, when he gets in the bathroom when he is
going through the entire ritual, he takes longer than a woman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Part of this ritual would involve this scalp treatment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Hair treatment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What else was involved in the ritual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, of course, the door was closed, you know. I am not
actually watching him. Of course, the shave and the shower.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he shower every day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, yes; sure. I will tell you when he really did his big cleaning
up was at night, before going to work. That was when the big ritual was,
he spent a big time in there. But it was really something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The next one I am going to hand you is Exhibit 5204. This
was used in the deposition of C. L. Crafard. I don’t believe there are any
other marks on here. I am going to ask you to look at this notebook, or rather,
the Xerox pages of a notebook, and ask you, first of all, generally if you
recognize that notebook?</p>

<p>Let me say that the notebook, if you will turn to the first page of all those
papers that are put together, and look at that first page carefully, you will
see that the notebook had written on the cover just the word “Addresses,” and,
of course, we can’t tell from what color the notebook was or what material it
was made out of, how it was bound, although it appears to be not a looseleaf
kind of notebook but one that was perhaps stitched at the back or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you ever recall anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I know he had two or three of those little things. Like I told
you before, I knew he had two or three of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize the handwriting in this particular notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I assume it is Jack’s.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you don’t actually recognize it as Jack’s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am not sure, but I assume it is Jack’s. To me they sort of
all look like the same handwriting, so I assume they are his.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, look at the first page that has writing on it, which actually
in this exhibit is numbered page 2, and tell us, do you recognize any of the
names there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. There is one here, and the reason I recognize this name here,
Patricia Stevens, because Patricia Stevens I think is a modeling school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did Jack deal with that modeling school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not that I know of. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don’t recognize that name through any association you
had with Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. That is the only way I would recognize the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize any other names on that page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Turn to the next page, which is page 3, and tell us if you recognize
any of the names there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. There is a name here I am not sure of, but it says Thelma
Brown. This could be a singer. I am not sure. Or Bertha Brown. I know
there is a girl by the name of Brown who was a colored girl, who was a singer,
and she has come pretty well up the line. Now, if this is the girl or not, I don’t
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did she sing for Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. A long, long time ago when she was smaller. Now she is big-<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>time.
Now, where she is singing I don’t know. I don’t know if that is her first
name, but I know there was a girl by the name of Brown. I don’t know if it was
Thelma Brown, Bertha Brown, or whatever it is. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize any other names on page 3?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Turn to page 4 and tell us if you recognize any of the names
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Ed Bernet. I have heard that name, but I don’t know what
it is. I can’t make out what it is. It sounds like an entertainer, but I am not
sure. The others I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don’t recognize any other names on that page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. There is only one other name there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Turn to the next page. Is that page 5?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; and I don’t know who that is. It is just one name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What name is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Bill Capehart. I don’t know who that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you want to turn to page 6?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Bob Eisman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t know who he is. There is nothing else but the
name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Do you want to turn to the next page, page 7. Do
you recognize that name, Ham Faust?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Page 8; do you recognize the name there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This boy here, he is resting in peace.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Martin Gimpel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He died of a heart attack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did he die?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He died, I would say, I would probably say a year and a half
ago, which tore Jack apart because they were kids together all their life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. From Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. He has been gone now about a year and a half, maybe 2
years, I am not sure, something like that. Now, the other name I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Ann Gibson. What was Jack’s relationship in Dallas with Mr. Gimpel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He was a tool salesman. He traveled. He sold tools. Now,
I have never seen him sell them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know what kind of tools, household tools or industrial
tools?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I think they were industrial tools. To my knowledge, I
think that is what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Mr. Gimpel have a family in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he single?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. When he came here, he didn’t always stay here. I mean, I
haven’t known him that long, when I met him, but when he was here, I don’t
know how long he stayed. He stayed, and traveled. But in this area, or
rather in the Dallas area, or wherever he was traveling, I don’t know if it was
in the State of Texas or out of it, or just where he traveled. Of course, he
stayed with Jack because he didn’t pay no rent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Jack supported him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Jack, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Page 9.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. There is a name here that I think is an entertainer. I am not
sure, Trinidad, Colo. Wait a minute; that is Trinidad, Colo., but I knew somebody
by the name of Trinidad. There was an entertainer. Cecil Hamlin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He is with the union. Now, what capacity or what, I don’t
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Which union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know which union.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he friendly with Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know, because I have only seen the man one time in
my life, and the time that I saw him I was introduced to him, not knowing
who he was, down at the courthouse, at the courthouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that at the trial or the bail bond hearing, or something
like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It was at this trial here, in the lobby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The Ruby trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I saw him in the lobby once. That is the only time I
ever seen the man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you had never seen him before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I had never seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you had never heard Jack speak of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I have heard the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How had you heard Jack speak of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Jack has asked me to call him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In what connection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. There was somebody, there were a couple of people owed
Jack some money, and he asked me to ask Cecil to see if Cecil would call them
to get the money or pick up the money. He had a couple of hundred dollars
out, and he wanted to ask him if he would be kind enough to collect it for
him or try to collect it for him, or call them up, or something of that nature.
I don’t know the rest of them. Page 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize any of the names on page 10?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think he had a stripper, a part-time stripper, at one time,
I am not sure. Of course, I don’t know if this is, but this says Grapevine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Grapevine, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; but I don’t know. A girl by the name of Linda, but I
never knew her last name, so I don’t know if this is her or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Page 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know who this is. I have seen this name before on
other pages, Jeanie. I don’t know what that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Page 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know who that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Page 13.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Latin Band, is that what that says?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It looks like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am thinking of Larry, the kid who works at the club, but what
would the Latin Band be? I don’t know who that is. I don’t know who this is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Page 14.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Page 15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know who that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This doesn’t have a page number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This is a repeat of the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. A duplicate of the previous page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t say it is a duplicate of the page, but the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let’s read the name so that the record is complete. Pat
Sancipian, Patricia Stevens. Xavier Cugat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I know the name. Who don’t know it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Jack never talked to you about him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; where he got it, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Turning to another page, which doesn’t have a number on it,
Sam Schwartz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know who that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Robyn Hoy Smith, Tom Teel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know who that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And turning to the last page, which is numbered 20, it simply
says Elizabeth. You don’t recognize that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to hand you another book that is marked Exhibit
5202, which was used in the deposition of C. L. Crafard, and it is a blue spiral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
notebook with the word “Penway” written on the front. It is called a “Penway
Memo Book.” Look through that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Is this Jack Ruby’s book? I can’t picture him writing like
that. This is terrible handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are looking now at the Crafard Exhibit No. 5202. Do you
recognize the handwriting in that book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. There is only one person who I think possibly could write like
this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would have to guess, and say probably Andrew, maybe. I
am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you don’t recognize it as Jack Ruby’s handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think it is. I don’t think this is Jack Ruby’s handwriting.
Jack don’t write this bad. This is terrible writing. I don’t think
that is Jack’s handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You have had a chance to go through this notebook. You mentioned,
looking at page 1 of Exhibit 5202, in which there is written some words
such as “Save, Vegas Club, Jack’s home,” and so forth. And there is the name
Buddy, with the words “Fort Worth” written after it, and a telephone number
underneath. Do you recognize that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This could be probably this guy that he was going to have, I
imagine, I am not sure, probably made those twistboards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize the name Buddy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I have never seen him; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You mentioned the name St. Charles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And St. Charles is written on this first page, with a telephone
number under it. Do you recognize that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That probably is his home number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember St. Charles’ number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember the number offhand; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack Ruby ever have anything to do with Mr. St. Charles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; nothing whatsoever. He knew him. He used to go through
and buy some medicine, or whatever it might be, a toothbrush, and things of
that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. St. Charles ran a drugstore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, he has a drugstore in the Statler Hilton Hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Mr. St. Charles have any connection with Jack Ruby’s
twistboards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; nothing. Never knew he had a twistboard. I would venture
to say that this book here, this is only one person I think who has a handwriting
like that, that would write this here. This probably, this could be, though I
have never seen this book, the handwriting looks like Andrew’s, Andrew Armstrong,
the colored boy. This is what I think it is. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you this. You made the remark that you know that
St. Charles didn’t know anything about the twistboards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But have you talked with St. Charles since Ruby shot Oswald,
and have you learned from St. Charles that he was unaware of the twistboards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have seen St. Charles exactly one time since then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What prompted you to make the statement that St. Charles
didn’t know anything about the twistboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would probably say, to the best of my knowledge, he didn’t
know anything about the twistboard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You would be surprised if he did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. If he did, I can’t say. It is possible that he did, but I would
say, to the best of my knowledge. I can’t say positively. I don’t think he did.
Now, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Turning over page 1, look at the names there. There are two
names at the bottom of the page. You testified about Abe Klinman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, the attorney. That is Earl Ruby, and Ed Pullman, which
I mentioned before to you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I can’t even read the first name. It looks like Leona or Lena.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Leona?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Miller; is that who it is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It might be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know who that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Clark Dotty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Turning over to page 2, do you recognize any of the names on
that page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This says Mar-Din?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This is another name, Henry Denture. I wouldn’t know who
that is. Earl Products.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I will skip over the back of page 2 because there is nothing on
there that you haven’t talked about. Look at page 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I can’t even understand what that last name is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are referring to the first name on there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know what it is anyhow, but I can’t even read the last
name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don’t recognize any of those names there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; that is Shay, I believe, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, Ruth Shay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I think we talked about this one before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now on the back of page 3 you have mentioned
Stanley Kaufman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But there is a Riky Kasada.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Scotty Milles or Mills?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don’t recognize that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. On page 4, Norma Bennett?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Judy Armstrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Burt Nelson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Floyd Turman you mentioned previously.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Buddy Turman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that the name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; his name is Buddy. Wait; he comes from Tyler, Tex.
Yes, here it is. This says Buddy. I didn’t know him by his first name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Floyd Turman <span class="locked">is——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Buddy Turman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The other Turman we talked about is Nick Turman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I don’t know who that is. Now, see, he is known by his
fighting name, is Buddy Turman and, of course, that is all I recall. I never
knew it was Floyd, but he is billed, and everything else, as Buddy Turman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On the back of page 4 there is the name Buddy Heard. Did
you know Buddy Heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Buddy Heard, yes. He is an entertainer who worked for Jack
once, I would probably say about two years ago was the last time he was in
Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Has Jack maintained a relationship with him recently?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I would say it was approximately, it must have been approximately
two years ago. He worked for him, I think, one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you say “no” to my question about Jack maintaining a
relationship with him recently?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know of any.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about any of the other names that you see there on the
back of page 4? Do you recognize any of those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What does this say? Is this Burt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Burt. Did you know a Burt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am not going to direct your attention to page 5 because page 5
doesn’t have anything on it. I believe it has nothing on it that we haven’t already
talked about. The back of page 5 has the name “Jerry Lindsay”. Do you recognize
that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. Floorman, that is the man that worked on the floor or did
some work for him, or something, but I don’t recognize the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize the name of Leo? Do you know anybody
named Leo?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Leo Tardi? He worked for Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think it is Tardi. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did he work for Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The last time he worked for Jack, he had worked both clubs,
you know, the Vegas and that one there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of work did he do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. After the shooting he worked up at the club at nights and, of
course, he was a salesman in the daytime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But what kind of work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He took the tickets in, you know, the $2 admission fees.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did he sell during the daytime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think clothing in a store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know what department store he worked for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or what store?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. It was in one of the downtown stores there. I don’t know
which one it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to pass over the front half of page 6 because there
is nothing written on there that appears to be a name, and I will direct your
attention to the back of page 6. Do you recognize any of the names there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know him, at the radio station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Dick Gifford?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recognize anything else on there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What is this supposed to say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. S-c-h-r-o-l-l.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now look at the front of page 7. Do you recognize any of those
names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This particular Leonard I have mentioned to you before, the
booking agent. The thing is to read these things. Who can read them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me help you, if I can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What does the top one say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Joe Roskydall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Never heard of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Dick Lenard you mentioned. E. J. Evans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. What is this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. W. E. Groveland?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Stevens Park Beauty Salon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Maisl Brothers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Boy, I tell you, you do all right with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The back of page 7, I will read these off to you. Ed McMulmore.
Does that mean anything to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. McKinney?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. The front of page 8; Leonard Wood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Don’t know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Milton Thomas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Clarence McInnis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Don’t know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. James Dotson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. James T. Aycox?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Nothing on the back of page 8 or the front of page 9. Page 9,
the back is blank. Page 10 is blank on both sides. Page 11 is a half sheet which
is blank on both sides. Page 12 I won’t direct your attention to because there
are no names on there. The back of page 12, the only name that appears on here
is Bill Remike. Does that mean anything to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Here is the name, Bobby Patterson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On page 13. I will turn over to the back of page 13. There is
the name, Tex Lacy, which we talked about before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have heard about that name, but I don’t know what capacity
Tex Lacy is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I said the back of page 13. Now on page 14, which is about
a third of a sheet of paper, there is the name Frank Fisher. Did you know
Frank Fisher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who is Frank Fisher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Frank Fisher was a trumpet player and the leader of his band
at one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Of a band?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In the Carousel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what else did he do besides performance as a musician?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he an interior decorator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not that I know of. If he was, that is news to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack talk to you or did you know in the week or so before
the President was shot whether Jack was considering opening up any new
night club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He had talked about one. I have never seen it. But he was
talking about a location that he had mentioned on McKinney Avenue. I think
this was a house type place and, as far as I know, nothing ever materialized or
whatever it was going to be. This is the only thing I knew about it. He never
took me over there. I have never seen it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How was Jack going to finance it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. That I didn’t know. Possibly he may have been
looking for a partner. I don’t know, or how or what I don’t know. You’ve got
me there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I won’t mention the back of page 14 because there is nothing
there. Clark Boland, does that mean anything to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; it seems that is a radio station there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Herman Flowers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. K. Hamilton. That is the front of page 16.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Miller, Collins Radio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Cody City Hall; do you now anybody by that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Jimmie Rhodes, do you know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The name sounds like I heard of it, but I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Wooldridge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Never heard of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Bob Litchfield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mrs. Moddy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know that either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On the back cover is written the name Newton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The only name I know of a Newton would be John Newton of the
newspaper. If that is him or not, I don’t know, because this is a telephone
number, I assume, isn’t it, but there is no prefix to it. Maybe this is it now. I
don’t even know if that is him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you went out to look at the Earl Warren sign, “Impeach
Earl Warren” sign, on Friday, or was it Saturday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack write anything down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don’t recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember. I didn’t see him write anything down. I
can’t quote if he did or didn’t, but I didn’t see him. I will put it that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack have any newspapers in the car with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I really don’t know. I just don’t refresh my mind if he did
have any newspapers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you drive Jack’s car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he drove it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I suggest now we probably ought to break to two-thirty.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:50 p.m. the proceeding recessed.)</p>

<h3>TESTIMONY OF GEORGE SENATOR RESUMED</h3>

<p>The proceeding reconvened at 2:10 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I will repeat what we say at the beginning of each session. We
are taking this deposition under the same conditions that we started out with,
and you are under the same oath that you have been under at the outset.</p>

<p>Just before we took a break for lunch we had been through a number of
notebooks which had many, many names in them. Let me ask you about some
other names.</p>

<p>Did you know or hear Jack mention a Lawrence Meyers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This man would have been from Chicago and he would have
been engaged in a sales capacity in sporting goods.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, wait a minute. You mentioned sporting goods. That’s
right. I met someone up there. As a matter of fact, Jack got a pair of pushups
from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Barbells?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. If it is Lawrence Meyers. I think that is the name. I am
not sure. Barbells, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now you met some man or you heard of some man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who you think might be Lawrence Meyers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I know who you mean. When you mentioned sporting
goods, then <span class="locked">it——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How do you happen to know of this man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I met him at the Carousel one night when he was in town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long before Oswald was shot would that have been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. I think it was in the summer. I think it was
this past summer. I think it was in the summer of 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would it have been in the month of November of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I think it was much longer, much before that. Well, it
couldn’t have been that. The reason I say that is because I wasn’t living with
Jack then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In November of 1963 you were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I was living next door to Jack. I wasn’t living with him. When
you mentioned—was it November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; <span class="locked">because——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the time you met this man you were not living with Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I was still living in my same apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You met <span class="locked">him——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think this was some time in the summer, or maybe the latter
part of the summer of 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much time did you spend with this man in the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, he was up at the Carousel. From there we went out and
had a bite to eat, and that was it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And can you describe him? How old a man was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would probably say he was 6 foot tall. I would say he is
around about 6 foot. I don’t remember the color of his eyes, black, brown, or blue.
I don’t remember. Either they are brown or blue. He had a good healthy
build, now, of a normal man of that height.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How old a man was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would have to say maybe in the late forties. I am not sure.
I am certain it is in the forties, if anything, you know. It could jump up a
little more. I would probably say he was in <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did Jack happen to know this fellow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. That was the one time I saw him in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you learn about him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I didn’t learn anything about him. I knew he was selling these
things, sporting goods, I guess, of various natures. As a matter of fact, I
heard him mention once that they had a plant or something like that in, I think,
Bonham, Tex., or a plant or something out there too, which is maybe about 75
miles from Dallas, or an office there or a plant or something out there I know.
I don’t know what it is. Maybe it is a manufacturing plant they had there
now. That was the only one time I saw him in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don’t have any idea how Jack came to meet this fellow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I mentioned the name Alex Gruber.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Alex Gruber.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you were going through the notebooks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And I believe you indicated you didn’t recognize that name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not the name; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me see if I can put this to you. Did you know of any
friend Jack had in California who might have been at one time a truck driver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t. A truck driver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you remember anybody that Jack was going to send a
dog to in California?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t. I have heard that mentioned before. I have
heard it mentioned. I don’t remember now if I read it in the newspaper or
from mouth to ear or what it was, but I have heard that, that he was going
to send it to somebody in California. Who it was, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about L. J. McWillie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have heard of the name McWillie, but I don’t know him. Is
it McWillie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. M-c-W-i-l-l-i-e.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. All I know is the name McWillie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What do you know about that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t even know him. Never met him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where have you heard the name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have heard Jack mention the name in the club. He was an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
old friend of Jack’s at one time or another. From where, what or how, I don’t
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know of any friends of <span class="locked">Jack——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. As a matter of fact, I thought McWillie was two names. I
thought his first name was Mac and his last name was Willie. But, of course,
I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know of any friends of Jack who are in jail presently,
in the penitentiary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know of a friend, a fellow who Jack had a business
association with, who is now in the penitentiary on a sodomy charge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have heard that there is somebody. It might be Huntsville.
It might be. I am not sure. I heard that somebody is down there. Now who
the man is, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack talk about him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have heard it mentioned quite some time ago, but who he is,
I don’t know. I don’t know the man. As a matter of fact I don’t even know
the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you familiar with the name H. L. Hunt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think everybody is. He is one of the very wealthy men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack ever mention having met him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You know H. L. Hunt is politically active, he has a radio
program.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He is in everything. He is in many, many things, I understand;
oh, well, I didn’t know what all his activities are, but the name is like, when
you hear the name, it is like listening to the name of the President—I mean that
well known, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you ever seen Jack with any literature that was put out by
H. L. Hunt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not that I know of offhand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you ever heard Jack mention Lamar Hunt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think so. That is his son, I think. I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you, George, have you ever belonged to any political
organizations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Never, never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don’t simply mean by that the Democratic Party or the
Republican Party, but any kind of organization which was interested in some
public issue, or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was your practice with respect to using Jack’s telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What was what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Your practice with respect to using Jack Ruby’s telephone at
home. I take it you used it to make local calls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Once in a while; yes. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you make long-distance calls, telephone calls, from Jack’s
home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t think I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. By long distance I mean any toll call, even to Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not that I know of. I don’t think I ever have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever have occasion to call Ralph Paul from Jack’s
telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have called him, but I don’t think I have ever called him from
the house that I can remember, mind you. Now I don’t know if I have ever or
not. I can’t quote and say “Yes, I did,” or “Yes, I didn’t.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you able to state whether or not on Friday, November 22,
you made any long-distance phone calls from Jack’s telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. On November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; Friday, November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think so. I don’t think I did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the next day, on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. On Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you make any toll calls on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think so. When I say I don’t think so, I don’t remember
if I did or not, but I don’t think so. I don’t want to say “No” positively or “Yes”
positive, because I am not sure. I just don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember Saturday morning, November 23, do you
remember whether Jack received any telephone calls that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you recall, for example, whether Larry Crafard called
that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember if he did or not. As I say, I can’t be quoted,
because I ain’t positive. I can’t say yes or no because I don’t remember on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you first become aware that Larry Crafard was no
longer in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The following Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you find out about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. When I went up there I asked Andrew one night, and I happened
to remember that it was Tuesday, one of the things I do remember, and
I said to Andrew, I said, “Andrew, where is Larry?” I said, “I didn’t see
him yesterday either,” or something like that, to that effect, and he said he
had left, and I said, “When did he leave?” He said he had left Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did Andrew know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He said—I think now he said he took $8 from the till, or something
to that effect, and I think he left a note that he was leaving, something
like that. These are not positive words, but I think this is what he said.
Something to that effect. And that is the first time I ever knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Andrew have any explanation as to why Larry left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; not that I know of. Incidentally, Andrew was back at
the trial, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Larry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I mean Larry, because Andrew lives in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; he was at the trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; they said he hitchhiked in from Wisconsin or some place
out there. I don’t know where it is. They said he hitchhiked all the way back
for the trial. That is what I heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I talked to him when I was sitting on the witness bench one
day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he tell you why he came back to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; but he said, he mentioned that he hitchhiked back, but
he didn’t say why he came back or anything of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he say anything to you about why he left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No: he didn’t. I never asked him. As a matter of fact, I wanted
to ask him, but I didn’t. I couldn’t imagine why he left. I believe he was
on the witness stand. What happened, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You know we were talking about what you did on Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. During the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I have here in front of me a copy of a statement that you provided
the Dallas Police Department. I notice in here that you say that you
left the house around noon on Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Something like that; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And that you had some things to do. Now try to think back
to when you talked with the police department. What things did you have
to do on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I can’t imagine. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have anything to do in connection with your business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I didn’t work that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any shopping to do other than for the groceries
you bought?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, I did that. I don’t remember if I did that. I just wonder
if I did the laundry. I normally do the laundry on Saturday or something. But
I don’t even recollect if I did that that day or not. I don’t remember. I think
I saw Jim Martin, but to the best of my recollection anything I did was only
minute, just the passing of an afternoon, or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have some recollection of having seen Jim Martin on
Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think I had a cocktail. I am not sure, but I think I had
a cocktail with him, at the Burgundy Room. I think I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would that have been in the afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; because he is around his office between somewhere between
12 and 1. I mean that is when he will leave, he won’t leave before
that, and if I remember right—I am not sure on that—but if I remember I
think we may have had a cocktail at the Burgundy Room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it you do begin to have some recollection of having spent
some time at the Burgundy Room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I know I was there that day, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But I mean Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think I may have been there for a while, because I know later
on that I met who I mentioned yesterday, Bill Downey, that I was there, and
that we went some other place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you see Downey <span class="locked">before——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think I saw Downey the latter part of the afternoon, or something
like that, or the early part of the evening. I don’t know if I met him in
the latter part of the afternoon or when it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And were <span class="locked">you——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It might have been in the early part of the afternoon. I am
not sure. But I also met him later. It must have been around 8 or 8:30
when we went out together. I was at the Burgundy Room. Then we went to
this other place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It is your recollection that you saw Downey then both in the
afternoon and the evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think I saw him in the afternoon, but the evening for sure.
I think I saw him in the afternoon. I am not sure. I think I made an appointment
to meet him later, and then we would go out for a beer or two. This is
what I think. I think now I am not sure on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you troubled on Saturday over your having gone with
Jack out to photograph this impeach Earl Warren sign?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Was I troubled when I went with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On Saturday did this trouble you in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You mean Saturday afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You mean did I think about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, I imagine that I would probably say that I had thought
about it; yes. As a matter of fact, I thought about that thing many a time;
I don’t know why; I don’t know why he wanted to go out that night and take
these pictures. He never mentioned why he wanted to see it or why he wanted
to snap the pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You didn’t mention this to the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You did mention, however, that you went out with Jack and
had coffee with him that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; at the Southland Hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Of course, this was all in sequence with having gone out to see
that Earl Warren sign?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But what was it that made you omit to tell the police that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Nothing particularly. I don’t know why. Just it was a shaken-up
day for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you worried that this might hurt Jack to talk about that
particular episode?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. As a matter of fact, it would do him justice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How do you feel that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think if a man is exploring somebody who put out a sign,
whoever it may be, who would want to impeach Earl Warren, our Supreme
Court Justice, or somebody who would put out these whys about the President
the day he is coming here, which weren’t good, the whys, I would say that this
would be in favor of him of wanting to know these things, why should they be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How would <span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Why would somebody want to impeach Earl Warren? For what
reason? I don’t know. I mean I don’t have the answer to it. But why would
a sign be put up there? Why did they want to impeach Earl Warren? Impeach
him about what? I have asked myself this many times, but I don’t know the
answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You see, it seems strange that you should have mentioned your
going to the Southland Hotel and having coffee and that occurred immediately
after you had gone out to see the Earl Warren sign and had also gone to the
post office—then I say I wonder how you could have forgotten it, once you had
your mind on having one to the Southland Hotel. You know you didn’t go right
from your apartment to the Southland Hotel to have coffee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. I don’t know why. I know I explained that to
Elmer Moore one day, and I said, “Elmer,” or “Mr. Moore,” rather, when he was
questioning me, I said, “Elmer, of course, the first day I had been shaken up,”
and I had mentioned to Mr. Moore when he took my text of the whole thing
how going about the sign, the two signs, how these had bypassed my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Two signs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, when I say the signs, the billboard and the newspaper ad,
when they took my statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you talked to me on the telephone from New York, I guess
it was on <span class="locked">Monday——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You asked me if I had a copy, or if I had seen the Bernard Weissman
ad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And I take it that in your mind this is a justification, this somehow
is a justification or some assistance to Jack in his defense, the fact that
he was interested in finding out about that advertisement and about the sign?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That’s right. He wanted to know the whys. He wanted to
know why somebody would want to impeach him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now is this a thought that has come to you after knowing, or
after having talked with the attorneys and knowing what the strategy of the
trial was going to be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Talking with people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or is this something that you felt almost immediately, that this
would be a justification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I thought definitely in my own thinking that this was a justification,
because when I was put on the witness stand for the bond hearing in early,
I think it was, December, I am not sure just when it was, when I was questioned
about that by Mr. Alexander, I told him that if anything this would be helping
Jack, in wanting to know why something of this nature would want to be put
out in Dallas. Why did the Dallas Daily Morning News want to accept an ad
like this when the President was coming into town that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you went out with Jack, did Jack tell you at all what
he was going to do with this information that he got?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; none whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he indicate that he might have been working for a newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Trying to do some freelance work for a newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; there wasn’t a thing mentioned. I say when Jack gets his
mind set on something, he wants to know why, the information, the why.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was it that you first learned that Jack had spent sometime
at the police station on Friday night? Did you ever learn it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You mean the Friday when he was bringing the sandwiches
and things of that nature there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. When did you first learn about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think it was after he woke me up that morning. I think
that is when he told me, and I think he mentioned it, yes, and then he mentioned
that he went to the synagogue there Friday and prayed for the President, and
that he saw his sister, and they were both crying, as it was related to me, over
the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You didn’t tell any of that to <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. To who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To the police department when you talked to them on the 24th,
did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember. See, you must <span class="locked">understand——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don’t you take a look—well, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You must understand when a person is grabbed the way I was
grabbed, or I will say not particularly me, but any human being, wouldn’t it
shake a human being up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it the police department asked you to tell them everything
you knew about what Jack had done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Let me say in the condition that I was in, I was pretty well
shaken up at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you feel that his being at the police department might hurt
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. I didn’t think about that. That didn’t even
enter my mind whether it did or not. All I know is he said he took sandwiches
over there, and that is all I know on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now you <span class="locked">also——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Now why he took it over there, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You also didn’t <span class="locked">mention——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Maybe I forgot a lot of things at that particular time, being
shook up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You also didn’t mention in this statement that you gave the
police department on the 24th——</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Didn’t what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In the statement that you gave to the police department on the
24th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I didn’t mention what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You did not mention anything about the telephone call from Little
Lynn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Maybe I forgot that, too. Look, I told you. I was in a shookup
state that first day. Maybe I did forget about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am just wondering if these things, if you thought in your own
mind that those events which you <span class="locked">omitted——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Was I trying to hide something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, could hurt Jack, and you wanted to help Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I wasn’t trying to hide anything. I definitely was not trying
to hide anything. But you must understand, like I repeated, any individual in
an event like this, now I can’t speak for anybody else, but I would probably say
they would be shaken up like I was, and I want you to know that I was really
shook up, that that would make a lot of people forget a lot of things, and
probably can’t remember things, being grabbed that fast and being talked to
that fast in that instantaneous—I was pretty well shaken up that day, very good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you did remember Jack talking about the President and
you mentioned you remembered that you thought you saw tears in his eyes, and
you remember his saying he was going to take his dog Sheba down to the club.
I am just wondering why it is you remembered some of these things, but you
didn’t remember some other things which were just, perhaps should have been
just as graphic, like going out to that impeach Earl Warren sign—that must
have just stood out as a sore thumb to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. There was no particular reason. Now maybe a lot of things that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
I mentioned there that I possibly could have forgotten, too. There was no particular
reason for it. There was nothing that I was trying to cover up or hide
because I got nothing to hide.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am not suggesting that in any sort of invidious sense.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It is just a shakeup of a fast brain, that is all, at the moment,
when all these things were happening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me hand you what I have marked as “Washington, D.C., April
23, 1964, George Senator Deposition, Exhibit 5400,” and I will sign my name to it.
This is a copy of an affidavit which appears to bear your signature which was
sworn to before William F. Alexander on November 24, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Is that the man who had me? I don’t remember who it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is apparently the man who is a notary public who took
this statement. Look it over. Read it if you would. I hand it to you now.
Tell me if you remember signing that and if that is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is, that is my signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Read it through to make sure as best you can remember that
that is a true copy of what you signed. It that a true copy of the statement you
signed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. To the best of my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I wonder then if you would sign that under my name. I hand
you that pen back. As I understand it, then, immediately after you signed this
statement before Mr. Alexander, you were then interviewed by an agent of the
FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, were you shaken up in dealing with the FBI agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In this same, or rather in this interview with the FBI, the FBI
reports you as telling them during that interview that you learned of Oswald’s
being shot just as you walked in the door of the Eatwell Restaurant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Just as I walked in? No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I was sitting. I was sitting. I wasn’t walking in the
door. I was down on the seat and already had my first cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Also, one gets the impression from the FBI interview it was your
recollection on November 24 that you called Jim Martin after you learned that
Jack Ruby had shot Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It was before you learned that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Right. I called him—wait, wait. No; that is right. I did.
But I wasn’t home. That was it. I called him and spoke to his daughter, one
of his little girls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And that was before you learned that <span class="locked">Ruby——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. When I heard that Oswald was shot, but nothing mentioned.
There was no name or no club mentioned, Oswald was shot—that is when I
called him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Directing your attention to the FBI’s report on November 24,
that you said you learned that Oswald was shot just as you walked in the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What makes you now remember that you were seated and had
a cup of coffee whereas apparently you didn’t remember that on November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Because the waitress who waited on me was the one who
said it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did she say it to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. She was behind the counter. Not specifically to me. It
was pretty loud.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they have a TV set on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t think so. I don’t know. She got her information
through either the phone, or they may have had a little radio. I don’t remember
just what it was, because I wasn’t looking directly where she was walking
around, or what she was doing, but she was behind the counter, and I was
sitting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much time elapsed between the time you learned that
Oswald had been shot and the time you learned that Ruby had been the person
who shot him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would probably say within 5 to 10 minutes, something like
that. It was a short while I know. It wasn’t long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I’m going to mark a document which I have before me in the
following manner: “Washington, D.C., April 23, 1964, George Senator, Deposition
Exhibit 5401,” and I am going to sign my name to it.</p>

<p>This document which I have marked as a copy of an interview report prepared
by Special Agent Kenneth C. Howe of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, of
an interview on November 24, 1963, with you, Mr. Senator. It consists of five
pages, typewritten pages, and they are numbered 296 to 300. I have marked
on page 296, and I have not marked the succeeding pages. I want to hand you
this and ask you now to take the time to read it over, and then I want to know
if that is an accurate report of what you told the FBI at that time.</p>

<p>I am not asking you whether, on further reflection, you would change what
you said in there, but merely whether that accurately reflects what you told them
at that time. If it doesn’t, why, will you point out the parts that are not accurate,
and we will see if we can’t correct it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Shall I make little notations here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are there some places you want to change?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Before you mark on it—why don’t you do <span class="locked">this——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It will only be a dot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don’t you just take this paper and make some notes on it
and then we can go back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. There is going to be some changes in here. I will point them
out to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you got some changes to make there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. I had better go over it with you though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don’t you read the sentence or sentences that you would
make changes in, and then we will discuss them? What I suggest you do is
read one sentence or a group of sentences that are wrong, and then we will discuss
that sentence or group, and then we will move on to the next one. Go right
ahead and read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It says here, “He had only casual association with him, mostly
only as a patron to his club, from that time on until approximately 3 years ago.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is on page 296 of the FBI report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. Now it wasn’t 3 years ago at the time. This was 2 years
ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In other words, your association with Jack was casual up until 2
years ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In other words, it was 1962, February, March, or April or somewheres
in there of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don’t you change with your pen, strike out the word
“three.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. On this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On that. And write “two.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You mean cross the three off and put a two in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. And then initial it and date it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It is going to be hard to squeeze it in between these lines.
Shall I put my initial after it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You won’t be able to see it. These writings here don’t coincide.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me talk a little bit more about this change in your relationship
with Jack. Up until approximately March or April of 1962 when your
relationship became more than casual, were there other people in Dallas to
whom you felt closer than Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I think maybe we are both misinterpreting this. When
you say closer, this is when I first started to—you know, when I was down and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
out and I first started to work for him, and I was living with him. You see what
I mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is March or April of 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would probably say either February, March, or April, something
like that. I don’t remember that I was living with him, because previous
to that I still didn’t see him any more than I ever did in the past.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And up to this time were there other people in Dallas whom you
saw more frequently than Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, the only time I saw Jack is when I ever met him anywheres,
if I should run across him anywheres, or once in a while I would go up to his
club, that was all, and it has never been anything but that up until that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did you see more frequently or on a more social basis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Actually I couldn’t see him frequently. Before that I was
traveling. See, I was traveling. I wasn’t home every weekend. There were
times when I was traveling, there were times I might miss a week from coming
home. It all depends on the location you are—if you are too far from home.
Then other times I might be gone two or three. It all depends, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What I want to get some idea of is up until this period that you
moved in with Jack in 1962, who were the people that you saw on a social
basis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, I have seen Bill Downey. What I want to impress you,
these people I don’t see every day, or like, you know, say I see them today, tomorrow,
the next day, and things like that. On rare occasions I saw Don
Taber. That time on rare occasions I saw Jim Martin. These were all rare, mind
you, then. See, I did more meeting. I met a lot of people at the Burgundy
Room most of the time. In other words, somebody has a favorite hangout.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And that Burgundy Room was yours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This is mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. For how long has it been your favorite hangout?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Ever since I came to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is a place you would go almost every day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would probably say more so than any other place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you go there almost every day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, not every day, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Two or three times a week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say yes, sure, and I always met some friends there—after
they all get out from work a lot of people always gathered, transient or
local, from 5 on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The Burgundy Room to you is sort of what a private club
would be to a wealthier man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is of that nature, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And there were certain other people who used to hang around
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Jack Ruby one of the people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I have only seen Jack go in there that I can remember
twice, but he never sat down and had a drink. In and out. Walked in. Jack
is not a drinking man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So would it be fair to say that for recreation and <span class="locked">pastime——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Just as one of my hangouts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You would go to the Burgundy Room and have a few beers,
a few drinks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. Whoever walked in. I had many friends who walked in.
Whoever walked in, there is many girls that I knew, many fellows that I knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you are not a man who spends his spare <span class="locked">time——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not particularly, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Playing golf or tennis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I’ll tell you—the only habit I got is I like to cook, this
is my golf or what somebody else would do, or whatever he may recreate in—I
used to like to piddle around in the kitchen. That is why Jack Ruby didn’t
like me. You are not writing that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You mean that you like to experiment with food?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, I like to putter around. I enjoy puttering around in
kitchens. I done this for a long time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you worked in a number of restaurants?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. But not in that capacity. Of course, I was broken in, you
know. When I say broken in, I worked for my brother you know, years ago,
but I wasn’t classified as any cook or any thing of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are there any sort of specialty foods you like to cook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I like to mess around with different concoctions, I mean because
anybody can throw a hamburger on, you know, in the home, or anybody
can throw a steak on, whether it comes out good or bad, that is not a
challenge. But to try to make some concoctions where you mix <span class="locked">things——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Salads?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. They can be salads or any hot dishes, something like that,
or see how good you can make spareribs come out, which a lot of people can’t
make good, and then all the lawyers in Dallas think I am the greatest when
it comes to making spareribs, because I have been invited many times, and I do
put on a good rib plate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And were you in the habit of inviting people to your place for
dinner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes, I have many a time. Nobody particular, but I have. I
mean this—I relished, I have been invited over to people’s homes. Jim Martin
has invited me to his place to cook. There is another lawyer invited me over
to his home to cook. They thought I did a good job in the kitchen. While
they sat down I was sweating in the kitchen, but it was fun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But Jack didn’t appreciate your cooking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He liked my cooking, but he wouldn’t eat it because he classified
me as one making rich, fatty foods, that would put a pouch on him.
This is the thing, because this is why I mentioned to you that I love to make
this avocado dish, which I mentioned to you before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is when we were having lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I didn’t pull out an avocado salad today as I did yesterday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I love avocadoes. I think they are great. I used to make a
concoction and put on avocado and everybody used to love it. I must have
put about nine different ingredients in it, but it tasted real good, real good.
They used to clean the plate out. That was a good enough answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now there are some other things in that statement or that interview
report that I think you want to change.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. These don’t look like my words. I don’t say
that some of these aren’t factors, you know, but I don’t see, I don’t think
some of these are the direct words that come out of my mouth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So that you understand, these are not supposed to be actually
the direct words that come out of your mouth, but this is their report of what
they recall your saying. Now if it changes the substance in some way, if they
have used words that change the meaning in some way, or the approach that
you had, I think it is important to bring that out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Let me read this off to you. This is right after the next sentence.
It says, “Thereafter he considers himself to be much closer to Ruby,
but in this regard could not explain why he considered himself closer during
the past 3 years.” Now I don’t even know what that means.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I understand it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t understand it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I understand it to mean that you felt that you were closer
to Ruby but you couldn’t explain to them why you were closer to Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Let me read this to myself again? This don’t make sense to
me. Maybe I don’t understand what I am reading, what I have read to you.
Do you want to go over it with me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This part I read to you, start there, “Thereafter.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. “Thereafter he considered himself to have been closer to Ruby,
but in this regard could not explain why he considered himself closer during
the past 3 years than the time before he knew Ruby.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
In other words, they are saying that you couldn’t explain why you felt closer
to Ruby in this recent period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. If I had just moved in, how could I really feel that closer, just
moving in? It doesn’t necessarily mean being close to him. I mean, this I don’t
understand. What do they mean when they say—how can you just move in with
somebody and say, say you are that close to him? You are there, that is true,
but what do you mean by being close to him? If you had just gone in and had
always known him <span class="locked">casually——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Isn’t part of the reason that you felt closer to him in recent years
than you had long before is that you began to live with him in recent years, and
that automatically made you closer? You saw him more often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; but I mean the way this sort of states to me, unless I
misinterpret it, like I just moved in and I am that close to him already, I am
really like a buddy-buddy, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; there is no mention in here at this point in the FBI interview
report of your having moved in with Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In so many words, though, doesn’t it sound the same to you?
“... than in the past 3 years”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; but it doesn’t mention that in the past 3 years you moved
in and began living with him, whereas before then you hadn’t lived with him.
As I understand what you have been saying to us up to this point is that your
closer relationship simply resulted from the fact that you began to see him every
day, whereas <span class="locked">before——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. See the way I interpret this, the moment I moved in I was already
close to him. Of course, I know that I am in the same place, but that is the
way I am interpreting it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let’s let it stand for the record, then, that you did not automatically
feel closer to Jack Ruby at the time you moved in with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Your moving in with him was not the result of having established
a close relationship, but was a result of Jack’s taking you in when you
didn’t have a place to live and didn’t have any money. Is that it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I mean the appreciation was there, I want you to know,
of these things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how did Jack happen to learn that you needed a place to
live and so he invited you in with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I identified myself that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In other words, you approached him and asked him if you could
move in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I don’t remember just how it was, but I was not in good
condition, I was hurting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And had there been something about Jack before that that had
indicated to you that Jack would be the kind of a guy who would respond
like this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; because he has responded to other people like this, and
after that, and I have seen it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you heard before you moved in with Jack that Jack had
taken in other people or done things for other people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The example number one is the chap that I told you is deceased—I
don’t say this man was hurting, but he was still living in Jack’s apartment
for free.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Martin Gimpel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Martin Gimpel. He was still living in Jack’s apartment for
free. I don’t say he was hurting for money, which I don’t know because
I didn’t know his business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You knew that at the time you approached Jack? You knew
Gimpel had been living with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I didn’t know Gimpel that way, just from running across him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But had anybody else suggested to you that Jack might be willing
to take you in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no; it was just one of those things that happened by chance.
That is all. Of course, within me I didn’t know what was going to happen, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
he took me in. I have seen other instances like this chap Larry. Now he ran
across him out at the fairgrounds.</p>

<p>I don’t know what it was, but this kid here didn’t have the right time. He was
doing something out there. His apparel was nothing, and Jack bought him a
suit. Of course, mind you, he put him in the club, let him sleep there, but he
made him work, but he gave him a few bucks. He gave him a place to sleep.
He put some clothes on his back.</p>

<p>And one time before he disappeared I even heard him mention once—Larry
didn’t have any front teeth, and I heard Jack mention once, “Larry, we’ll have
to do something about your teeth, to get you some front teeth.” This is a true
fact. As tough as this guy was at times, he was soft too. He had a heart. Many
a buck he shelled out to somebody to grab a bite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You suggested you found this Ewing Street apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The new place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You made the <span class="locked">decision——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Somebody told me to take a look at this new place going up.
At the time I looked at it, this place wasn’t even ready.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you suggest to Jack that he might also want to move
in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I mentioned to Jack to take a look at it, see. This is before
either one of us were living there. The thing was still in the working stages.
It was coming round to completion, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As we had discussed before, you moved in with Jack in the early
part of 1962 and lived with him for about 5 months?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. But not at this place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; at another place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And, of course, during that 5 months you began to know the
man better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You came closer to him, but you decided when you got a job you
wanted to move out from him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now I am curious as to why you decided that you wanted to
move out rather than decide that you would stay there and pay part of the rent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Particularly one. I told you he didn’t keep a very clean place,
but should I classify myself to say a man who is unemployed, a beggar—beggars
can’t be choosers, that is an old saying, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is part of it. All right, I know the overall picture that
Jack would rather live alone, see. I mean if somebody is out, something like
me, if I needed a place, all right, he would keep me. But in the overall picture
he would rather live alone.</p>

<p>And many a guy has slept at his place whether the Carousel or one of the
apartments he may live in, and I don’t know how many he has lived in previous
to when I knew him where he may put up a guy for a night, 2, 3, 4, or 5,
whatever it might be, and fed him, because he was tapped or something of that
nature. He has done this many a time, and I would probably say even before
I knew him, and I feel this probably could go back to the hardships of his
youth, because he, as I understand it, he had a rough bringing up and growing
up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he talk about that to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He talked about some of it, but I never heard all of it come out
in the courtroom. Of course, I never knew up until, you know, the recent times
that his mother was in an institution or a crazy house, which I never knew.
And, of course, I didn’t know how drunk his father used to be, but I understand
he was a <span class="locked">habitual——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he talk about his father when you lived with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think he had mentioned his father, but he had never mentioned
his mother, never, which I never knew. Of course, this all come out
after the shooting, you know, everything come out, was brought out either by
the sisters or somebody. And I never knew about how the kids were all separated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
things of that nature, when they were young. One was placed here, one
was placed there, wherever they were placed. A lot of these things I never
even knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So this conclusion that you are now <span class="locked">drawing——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would probably say this might be why he has done some of
the things he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are drawing this conclusion on the basis of what you have
learned since he shot Oswald, and not on the basis of anything that you knew
beforehand? In other words, these things you have been talking about, his
father and his mother and the separation of the children, this you first learned
after he shot Oswald? You didn’t know about that when you were living with
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I didn’t know about it. I heard him mention that he had
tough days as a kid, but he never talked about them too much, very, very
little. All these things, the majority of the things that come out, come out
after the trial, I mean after the shooting. There, of course, I think his sisters
come out with the majority of it and probably his brothers, when things had to
be related and had to go back all these years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Go ahead through there as you have, through that Exhibit 5401,
and if there is anything else in there that you think should be changed or
clarified—keep in mind what I am primarily concerned with is whether this
report you are looking at is an accurate report of what was told to the FBI
at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Let me run through this one: “He added he occasionally when
low on funds would be asked by Ruby to come and stay a day or two with
him until he got back on his feet”.</p>

<p>Of course, this is a comma, and then it continues, but I want to stop right
there. Let me run through the whole thing. “He added he occasionally when
low on funds would be asked by Ruby to come and stay a day or two with him
until he got back on his feet, but he claims he actually never lived with him
until about November 1, 1963, when he moved into the apartment of Ruby’s,
apartment 207, 223 South Ewing, Dallas, Tex.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; well, that is inaccurate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, my only question to you is when the FBI interviewed
you, and this is on November 24, did you omit to tell them that you had lived
with Ruby on an earlier occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. To the best of my knowledge. I don’t think I did omit that.
I don’t think I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I think the record is sufficiently clear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Now, there are a lot of things I must tell you which I have
told you before. I am not always sure of everything, you know. In other
words, I have to use these words to let you know that I ain’t lying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I think the record will be clear from this deposition that you
didn’t live with him before November 1st of 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, unless that you are certain that you did tell the FBI
about living with Ruby before November 1st, I would rather not change it
on there, write it in there, but I would rather simply let the record show that
we are making here, simply let it reflect that that is inaccurate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Let me run back on this one again, part of this again:</p>

<p>“He added he occasionally when low on funds would be asked by Ruby to
come and stay a day or two with him until he got back on his feet,”.</p>

<p>This was never, because the first time I stayed with him was when I stayed
at the club, and then moved with him, because I stayed with him 5 to 6 months,
something like that. Of course, I don’t know how you classify this, how important
it is to you or not, because I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there occasions other than the time that you lived with
him for 5 or 6 months that you did come and stay with him for a day or two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It never happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I was with him. I mean I wasn’t in and out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now is it possible that you could have told them this in the
anxiety and turmoil that you were under at the time this interview took place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I could probably say that anything at that time, that day,
could be possible. Maybe I feel it isn’t, but let me say that I wasn’t in the best
of condition that day. I would say anybody that was in the nature that I was in,
and I don’t care who the individual was, would have been shaken up as well
as I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I think again here now the record will reflect, and I want to go
through and point these out as you are doing, but I think the record again here
will reflect what is accurate as to what has actually happened.</p>

<p>Let’s let this thing stand, unless you are 100 percent sure that you didn’t say
that, let’s let it stand on there as written. By “on there” I am referring to the
Exhibit 5401.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Now here is a point:</p>

<p>“Shortly after Senator first met him, Ruby opened the Sovereign Club on the
second floor of the building on the southeast corner of Field and Commerce in
downtown Dallas.”</p>

<p>Now this was before I got to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He was running the Sovereign Club before you met him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He was in the Sovereign Club; yes. I don’t know how long
he was in there, but he was in there before I came that close to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you had known Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, I have known him; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Even when he ran the Silver Spur, didn’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I wasn’t living in Dallas then. That is way before my time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You knew him before he opened the Sovereign Club when he
only had the Vegas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, sure. This is the Sovereign Club. Wait a minute. It says
shortly after I first met him. My God, this don’t go that far back, and I have
known Ruby, unless he could have meant the Vegas Club, I don’t know. Of course,
I don’t know how important this is to you either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Again here I am glad you pointed this out. Here I think that
this deposition will clear this up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Now here is one that says I wasn’t able to furnish the individual’s
name, but I know it now.</p>

<p>“Ruby had a partner in the operation of the Sovereign Club, but Senator was
unable to furnish this individual’s name.”</p>

<p>But we have talked about that name today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Joe Slayton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Joe Slayton; yes, sir. Now I don’t think I knew who it was
then, who his partner was. “Senator can state only that he believes Ruby to be
the sole owner and operator of the present Carousel Club.”</p>

<p>Now there was a backer and I knew him well, but I didn’t know the conditions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you reluctant at the time you talked to the FBI to disclose
this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. You mean to hold back on them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is the way it sounds when you say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no; I wasn’t. As well as I knew him I didn’t know the
formality of what he had to the Carousel as many times as he came there. I
didn’t know what his status was in it. I knew there was a close—I mean he
had a close relationship with Jack. He knew him well.</p>

<p>“Ruby actively managed the Carousel Club although he still as far as Senator
knows owns the Vegas Club,” which we know different now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you want to go on to the next page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am through with that page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Look at page 297 of this same report and tell us if there are any
changes or modifications or corrections you want to make there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What is I.E., the initials?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That means in explanation. The sentence you are referring to is,</p>

<p>“Senator was of the opinion Ruby, since he is Jewish, feels somewhat the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
on things of this type as he (Senator) does, i.e., a Jew has no right to express
opinions of any sort, especially when he is in business, since he has enough
strikes against him just being a Jew.”</p>

<p>In other words, this statement about a Jew having no right to express
opinions of any sort is a belief that you have, and the FBI is saying you believe
that, and you think Ruby believes the same thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t believe I said that. I don’t believe I ever said that. I
know that Ruby is a sensitive man as far as when the word “Jew” comes up,
you know, in something he don’t like. He takes tremendous offense. No; I am
not of the nature of Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then do you feel that a Jewish person has no business expressing
political opinions, and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, they certainly have a perfect right to express opinions as
anybody else. I would probably say—let me say I think they are more careful.
I can’t speak for every individual, mind you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you think that Jack felt that a Jewish person has no business
<span class="locked">expressing——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Opinions of any sort, especially when he is in business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know what he felt. All I know is that he gets pretty
sensitive when somebody is knocking it, or jokes and things, things of that
nature, he don’t go for it nohow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This language which we have been quoting arises in a paragraph
that starts out:</p>

<p>“Ruby never expressed any special political preferences and never even discussed
political matters.”</p>

<p>Then it goes on to state this view, that “A Jew has no right to express opinions
of any sort,” the suggestion being that Ruby never discussed politics because
he didn’t think a Jew should discuss politics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know about that. Of course, I can’t quote Ruby’s words.
I can’t think for Ruby like I can’t think for anybody else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you would say that now your present opinion is that you
have no information about Ruby which would make you believe that he declined
to be interested in political matters because of his Jewish background,
that is, his Jewish background discouraged him or made him feel that he
shouldn’t have this kind <span class="locked">of——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I couldn’t even answer that because I don’t even know. I don’t
even know. All I do know is I know that anybody comes out and calls him a
God-damned Jew or something to that effect, he don’t go for this nohow, he just
don’t go for it. He is sensitive that way.</p>

<p>Now somebody could say it to me and I would probably be able to laugh it
off, whether I did or didn’t like it, but I tell you Jack Ruby don’t laugh
these things off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He is sensitive about being criticized because he is a Jew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you don’t feel, I take it, that there is necessarily any connection
between his sensitivity to being a Jew and his apparent lack of interest
in politics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If now in discussing this situation in an atmosphere which I
take it is a little bit more relaxed than it was on November 24th, if you were
to offer a judgment as to why Jack Ruby didn’t appear to be interested in
politics, what would you suggest for the reason?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have no answer for it, but all I can say is these things don’t
interest him. He was not interested in these things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is his primary interest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Show business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about girls? How about sex? Is that an important interest
to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It is as natural for him as it is for any other male human being.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this a matter, though—was sex something that he discussed
as much as he discussed his business, for example?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no. I don’t say—I don’t say that he hasn’t discussed it,
but I will say that there isn’t any male that hasn’t discussed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Go ahead with that page 297 and point out any other paragraphs
that you would change or correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In this next column here, the only thing is, “Ruby owned a
revolver which Senator could describe only by saying it was black. This was
kept at the Carousel Club, although occasionally Ruby would carry it back and
forth between the club and his home because he usually carried a fairly large
sum of money.”</p>

<p>Now there is only one little point there I want to bring out, and this is the
point I want to bring out:</p>

<p>“This was kept at the Carousel Club, although occasionally Ruby would carry
it back and forth between the club and his home.”</p>

<p>This was an everyday occurrence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He carried it back and forth every day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. When he left the house to go to the club, bingo, that went with
him. When he left the club to go home, that went with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you this. Did he keep the gun in the apartment or
did he keep it in his car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He kept it in his apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He kept it in the apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now would he keep it on his person or would he keep it in a
moneybag?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It has been both ways. It all depends on how he is going home.
I mean, no particular reason. He has kept it both ways.</p>

<p>Now, I can’t quote how many times he has it in his pocket or in his moneybag,
something like that, and I can’t even quote, maybe occasionally he may have
forgotten it and left it in the car. If he did leave it in the car it would be locked
in the trunk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have the habit of taking the revolver out of the automobile
when he got to the Carousel Club and carrying it up into the Carousel Club,
or don’t you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, he takes it up there, sure. He takes it upstairs. Now if
he does it every day, you must understand that I am not watching every move
Jack Ruby made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many times did you see it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t even know. I can’t quote the times, but I would probably
say the majority of times it probably went up, and then again it may have went
up all the time. As I say, I am not watching, looking for a bag all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it also possible he may have only taken it up occasionally to
the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would probably say the majority of the times it went up. If
you are asking me to break it down, I can’t break it down. First of all, I am
not always with him when he is going to the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is right. On the occasions that you saw him carry it
up into the club did he carry it up in his pocket or did he carry it in a bag?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The times that I have seen him, I have seen him have it in the
bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I would think that if he didn’t have a holster it would be pretty
cumbersome to carry that revolver around the club in his pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have never known him to have a holster. I have never seen
one, never seen a holster on him, or what do you call these things, shoulder?
I have never seen one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever see a holster in his automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I don’t even know if he even had one. This is a part
that I have had a lot of trouble with, with a lot of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What part is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This is the part—this is why I think they were probably looking
at me as a fag or a queer: “Senator on some occasions would refer to Ruby as a
boyfriend.” And I have said that to many people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why did you happen to use that term?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It is a word I have used all my life, when I was even a kid.
There was no particular reason. My boyfriends, some people may say “This
is my acquaintance.” It happens to be I have always used this word, no particular
reason. Maybe I would probably say it was a habit more than anything
else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now let me ask you this: You stated to us unequivocally you
are not a homosexual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You can be assured, you can be assured. I will say that
Georgie still loves women yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is not necessarily inconsistent with being a homosexual,
but I am not <span class="locked">suggesting——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. But you heard my words, though, my words they are direct
believe me. And I don’t intend changing it. I may not be that strong, but I
don’t intend changing them. Of course, age is a benefactor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are talking about your affection for women?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; certainly. I still like the beauty of the female sex. Let
me read the rest of this. Let me quote you something that Mr. Alexander had
me at the first bond hearing—I can’t help but think of it when I read this
“boyfriend” and how many times that has been quoted. It has never been
quoted me direct, but I have heard it hearsay, you know, things like that. At
the bond hearing, the first bond hearing, Mr. Alexander said to me:</p>

<p>“You and Jack Ruby lived together?” And I said, “Yes.”</p>

<p>He says, “How many bedrooms in the apartment you live in?”</p>

<p>I said, “Two.”</p>

<p>He says, “What are the other rooms?”</p>

<p>I says, “There is a bathroom, kitchen, and a living room.”</p>

<p>Then he come out with this live one, which I grasped right away. This is
what I call it.</p>

<p>“Where do you keep the TV?”</p>

<p>I didn’t particularly like it, but I was on the witness stand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I said, “In the living room,” where it is. But I caught the
drift right away. And I wasn’t happy about that because I couldn’t open my
mouth because I was on the witness stand.</p>

<p>Page 298. You got the drift of that, didn’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; very clear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I can’t quote the rest of it because he put it down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Go ahead, I am interested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In other words, what this means is Jack Ruby and I are in bed
together, probably holding hands, or whatever it might be, watching TV. Is
that easy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Isn’t that logical?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. And I was pretty disturbed over this. How does he base something
like this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it he didn’t follow it up in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not the second time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He didn’t attempt to discredit your statement that it was kept
in the living room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. And when he didn’t bring that up at all on the witness
<span class="locked">stand——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. At the trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. At the trial. There is something here; I don’t know what it
means; the difference may be an hour or two, according to what time I came
home that Friday night—he said between 9 and 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When do you think it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say between 10 and 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you here: What did you do from the time you heard
that the President had been shot on Friday until you came home at, say 10
o’clock? Did you work the rest of that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That was a black day; man, that was a sad day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You were at Jack’s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That was a day I will tell you I don’t think a living soul in
Dallas had any ambition to work. You would have to see that town that day
and the feeling of all the individuals in that town. It was really a sad, sad
day. It was a weeping day. I’ll tell you that is what it was; it was a weeping
day for the city.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you go to the Burgundy Room? Where did you go from
Jack’s when you first heard this news?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think I went downtown; did a little deskwork again. I am
not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Talk out loud and then we can correct it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am not sure what it was. I don’t remember anymore. I
think I went to the Burgundy Room. I think I just messed around downtown
in the area. No particular place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would it be a place like the Burgundy Room, a tavern?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Probably so; probably so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember any people you saw on Friday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I can’t recollect. It was a very sad day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I think that is a day that is rather vivid to most of us. I know
it is with me. I am just wondering if you can’t think where you were that
day, and who you talked to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In all probability I probably spoke to many people downtown
that day, or various places, wherever I may have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What other places are you accustomed to go to besides the
Burgundy Room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The Burgundy Room; there is another place I used to drop
in, which is called the Smuggler, which is uptown. These are both places
that I went to. Of course, the Burgundy Room is No. 1. The other place I do
go just occasionally, I do go to the place occasionally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you say you were hanging around downtown, you were
hanging around someplace where you could have a drink, a bite to eat, or
something of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would probably say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you wouldn’t have been in a department store or a drugstore,
someplace like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t think so. I mean I don’t know. A department
store; definitely I haven’t been in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We are talking about someplace where you could get a drink,
watch television, and watch the events on television. Did you spend all day
watching the events on television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I didn’t. I think I was in the downtown area. I think
I was in the downtown area most of that day, if I am not mistaken. I don’t
remember just where I was. I may have floated from downtown uptown. I
don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you think you had quite a bit to drink that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I will probably say I had maybe a fair amount. I mean, to
be drunk or anything of that nature, I don’t think I was drunk that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it you are pretty well able to hold your liquor, from
what you said before. You feel that you are?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So that I wonder <span class="locked">if——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In other words, I got to be careful when I’m driving because
if you get nabbed by the Dallas cops, you are in trouble, but good trouble,
and I don’t want to get in that condition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What I am wondering, from what you are saying here, if it
isn’t a fair impression to <span class="locked">draw——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. If it isn’t what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If I couldn’t fairly infer that you had been drinking most of
the time after you heard that the President was shot, although you don’t feel
that you had been drinking so much that you weren’t in control of yourself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, I was in control of myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you had been drinking fairly steadily from the time you
heard the President was shot until you went home that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would this have anything to do with your failure to recollect
what you had done that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think I was that tight; no. I just don’t remember where
I navigated that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you suggest again—and I keep throwing the same question
back to you—can you think or suggest someone that you saw that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know if I saw—I keep on bringing up this attorney all
the while, Jim Martin. I don’t know if I saw him, called him, or went to
his office that day or not. I used to meet him before all this here was going
on, you know, for cocktail hour before I went home, between 5 to 6, and went
home, but I don’t know if I met him that day or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you have dinner that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t even think I had dinner that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you attempt to get in touch with Jack Ruby that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No particular reason why. I just didn’t; that is all. I didn’t
even look for him. There was no special reason. You see, I have never, if
I am out, gotten on the telephone to see if he was home or what he was going
to do or things of that nature. In other words, when I am out I am free.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Jack wasn’t somebody that you did things with; is that fair
to say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I didn’t do much with him; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And part of the reason was Jack didn’t drink? Wasn’t that
probably part of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Jack don’t like me drinking and Jack don’t like to see me go into
joints. All right. Now the Burgundy Room; I don’t know if you have ever
been there while you were down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; I haven’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It is a nice place. It gets fine transient trade and local people,
and it is one of the nicest places, I feel as an open bar that you can go to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does Jack somehow have the idea that you drink too much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not exactly drink too much. You know I can drink one beer
and he will say, “You are drunk, aren’t you?” He will pull this on me. He has
pulled it many a time on me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does he feel that way about other people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. I don’t know about other people. But he didn’t
like me drinking. He said it to me many a time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why did you put up with a guy who criticized your personal
habits as much as Jack appears to have done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In all reality, it didn’t bother me. I didn’t care what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He sort of treated you like you were his son?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, no; no. He just didn’t like to have me drink; that is all.
He felt I was wasting—believe it or not, here is a man with a club who felt I
was throwing my money away, and he felt that I couldn’t afford to be throwing
my money away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He took some sort of a brotherly or fatherly interest in you, or
was this just Jack’s desire to dominate people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Dominate? I don’t know if “dominate” would be the word.
But as a friend he liked me; I will put it that way. He liked me as a friend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that because of anything you had done for him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, you know, I did a lot of things for him, and, of course,
he has done things for me, you know. When I was down and out he helped me out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You showed him a certain amount of loyalty and confidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; you see, I don’t argue back with him. I don’t know if he
likes this or not, you know. I don’t want to argue with him. So I “Yes” him
to get the argument over with, because when he hollers at me he hollers from
the rooftops. But when you hear enough of it, it didn’t bother me. It may have
bothered a lot of people, but it didn’t bother me because with me I knew there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
was no harm that would be done. But the shrill of his voice, you know he was
around. You could hear it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. OK; let’s go on there on page 298 from where we were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It says, “Ruby and Senator arose on November 24, and Senator
noticed Ruby had brought one of four dogs which he ordinarily keeps at the
Carousel home with him.” He brings this same dog home every night. And
when it says, “Ruby and Senator arose,” it is like we woke up at the same time.
That is not so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This refers to Sunday morning, November 24; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And the correct statement of this would be <span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I woke up before he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You woke up before he did, and that Jack always keeps <span class="locked">Sheba——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Always brings Sheba home every night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it customary also for him to take Sheba down to the club
every day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Both forth and back, forth and back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is Sheba with him wherever he goes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; the dog is always with him. This was his pet. This was
his favorite of a few dogs that he had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. OK; I think the record is clear enough on that; that we don’t
have to make any entry on the page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Of course, the other is what we discussed before about the signs
that you have on this page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. There is nothing in there about the signs, is there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. None. Elmer Moore has the one about the signs. This is page
299. I forgot to tell you. I went to this restaurant, it says, to eat. I just had
that coffee. The morning when I went down to eat on Main Street, it says I
went down to eat. I only had coffee. “He estimated as he arrived there at
approximately 11:30 and as he walked in the door he overheard one of the
waitresses saying Oswald has been shot.” This is not so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This was after you sat down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I had been sitting already.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that on page 300 or page 299?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. 299. Now he got this twisted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you read the part that is twisted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. “Shortly thereafter the waitress told Senator that Oswald
had been shot by a local tavern operator, and a short while after that he learned
the name of this individual to be Jack Ruby. He said he was dumfounded, and
did not know what to do, but after a short while he went to the telephone and
called Jim Martin on Gladiola Street, Dallas, as an attorney whom he knew.”
We went through that. Do you want to go through that again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, I want to know if you say now, of course, that that is not
what happened. Now, what did you tell the agent? Could you have told the
agent that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; when the waitress said that she heard Oswald had been
shot, I called Jim Martin, but nobody knew who. The daughter answered the
phone and said her daddy was in church, and that he would be home in a short
while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It is your recollection that when you called Jim Martin, you
couldn’t get ahold of him, but you talked to his daughter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How old is his daughter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He had three of them, and I don’t remember which one answered.
Of course, one is too young. I don’t know which one he went to church with.
One is 15 or 16 and the other is, I think, 10 or 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And is there one even younger than 10 or 11?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, an infant. Maybe she is 2 or 3 years old; something
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you tell the daughter who you were; who was calling?
Did you leave word?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am not sure if I told her to tell her daddy that George called.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
I am not sure if I did or not. I don’t want to say I did and I don’t want to
say I didn’t, because I don’t remember. No; I didn’t leave right after that.
I still had a cup of coffee yet. It says I left right after this call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is incorrect; is that what you are saying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. “He said this attorney was not at home, so he got into his car
and drove to the attorney’s house to wait for his return.” This I did not do.
What I did was I still sat there and I had two cups of coffee, when this girl
hollered out again, “the Carousel, Jack Ruby,” which words were sort of mispronounced
the way she said it; this is when I went. Of course, I sat there
for a little bit, not knowing what the hell to do. This was stunning. I sort
of froze right to the seat when I heard that. Page 300. I read too slow,
don’t I?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is all right. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Let me run this through. I don’t catch the last part of this:
“He never heard Ruby say Oswald had ever visited either one of the clubs in
which Ruby was interested.” Does that mean, in other words, the clubs that
Jack owned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. All right; OK.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you a few questions. You have had a chance to
read that all over. Now on page 298 the FBI reports you in this fashion:</p>

<p>“Senator has no accurate idea as to where Ruby had been all day.” That
refers to Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. November 24.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Twenty-second; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. “But does know that, because of the shooting of the President,
Ruby has had many businessmen in Dallas close his business. Senator has
some recollection Ruby said he had been at his sister’s home for awhile.”
Is it fair then to draw the conclusion from that statement that, when you
talked with the FBI on November 24, you did know what Ruby had done on
Friday night, on Friday other than that he had closed his business, and that
he had been at his sister’s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. He went to the police station with sandwiches, I heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But, you see, you told the FBI on November 24, when this presumably
was as fresh in your mind as it is ever going to be, that you had no
accurate idea where Ruby had been all day, and the only things that you
could remember were that he closed his business and he had some recollection
that he had been at his sister’s home for awhile. You didn’t mention, I take
it, to the FBI on the 24th——</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. As a matter of fact, I probably forgot to mention it now, come
to think of it, the synagogue and things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You didn’t mention the synagogue. You didn’t mention that
he had been to the police station. You didn’t <span class="locked">mention——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You must understand, like I told you before, you know, when
a man is in a shaken-up condition, it is true that you might say that this should
be fresh in my mind, but when a man is in a shaken condition and nervous—and
you can’t help but be nervous—so I may have slipped up on some of the
things that I probably couldn’t think of momentarily when he was questioning me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it possible that the fact is that on the 24th you really didn’t
know, that it was sometime after the 24th that you learned that Jack had been
to the police station with sandwiches, and that he had been to the synagogue,
that Jack didn’t even tell you this on Friday or Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I didn’t see him Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Saturday morning, that he didn’t tell you Saturday morning
that he had been to those places? Is it possible that Jack never told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no; he did tell me that. How else would I know? How
else would I have known that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You might have learned it since November 24, by talking with
somebody or reading something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Why would I want—let me ask you this—why would I want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
to leave out that he went to the police station—if I were able to think of it—or
bringing sandwiches? Why would I want to leave out that he went to the
synagogue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is why I am suggesting that you didn’t know that on the
24th, that it wasn’t until later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I didn’t know it on the 24th. I didn’t know it. I didn’t see
him. I didn’t know it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, on November 24, up until the time you were interviewed
by the FBI on November 24, you did not know that Jack had been to the police
station, and you did not know that he had been to the synagogue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You learned about that sometime after the 24th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I think I learned it before that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. See; what I am suggesting is that if you did learn it before
the 24th, this would have been something you would have remembered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You asked what makes something slip a man’s mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Wouldn’t you be more likely to remember he had been to the
police station than he had been to visit his sister? If a man had told you on
Saturday morning right after the President had been shot that he had been
to the police station, and had said anything about what he had done there,
wouldn’t that have been something that you would have remembered as being
important? You would have been curious, wouldn’t you? You would have
asked the man “What did you see down at the police station? Who did you
talk to down there?” After all, that was right down there where Oswald was,
and where the investigation was going on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It is befuddling. I still think it was Saturday. There is an
incident I just happened to think of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. After he had woken me up on Saturday morning, there was a
bunch of sandwiches still wrapped that hadn’t been distributed, and—I don’t
know—I had no idea how many he bought or how many he had made, but he
still come home with maybe 6, 8, 10, or 12 of those sandwiches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of sandwiches were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think they were corn beef and pastrami on rye, if I remember
right, on rye bread. This I do remember, and they were still on the kitchen
table, and as a matter of fact they were in two bags, if I remember right. They
were in two bags. I think he had some cake too, that he bought in the delicatessen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You saw that Saturday morning when you got up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does that recall anything further to your mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; now this here I never even told anybody. I never even
told this to anybody. This is the first time that I have ever exposed this. It
don’t matter who is questioning me, this is the first time. Now why didn’t I
think of this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is not so extraordinary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; you may say it is trivial or it may be trivial to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is the kind of a thing that you might forget and that is
also the kind of thing that as you look back from this period of <span class="locked">time——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have been trying to think as much as I could. Now I gather
I can remember this part, this one here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember any discussion with Jack about those sandwiches?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; he had been to the police station and he had passed out
a lot to various policemen or plainclothesmen. I don’t know who. I don’t know
who he passed them out to.</p>

<p>But it seems like I gather that he must have had an awful lot of these made,
or whatever it might have been. He must have had a slew of them made. Now
why I did it I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is this possible, that all you would have learned from him, you
asked him “Where did you get these sandwiches” and he said “I got them for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
the men at the police station but they didn’t eat them”? Could that have been
the conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he passed out some; I know. He said he had passed out
some sandwiches. As a matter of fact he even took some to his sister.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He took some sandwiches to his sister? When did he take the
sandwiches to his sister?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That was sometime Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you learn that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. From Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I suggest <span class="locked">again——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I didn’t see his sister.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I suggest again that if Jack had told you that he actually got
into the police station and distributed those sandwiches to policemen in the
police station, it would have occurred to you to ask, well, you know, what was
going on in the investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I didn’t ask him what was going on. As a matter of fact, I
don’t even know what part of the police station he was in, or any locale of the
police station he was in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he tell you anything about seeing anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He mentioned that he had gone to the police station and gave
out sandwiches. That is all I knew about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he mention seeing anybody else except policemen at the
police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think he had a glance at Oswald in one of the rooms, or something
like that, as he was going by or something of that nature. I am not sure
of this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you don’t know whether you knew that on the 24th or not,
do you, or whether this is something you read later on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t remember. I just don’t remember. I can’t say “Yes”
or say “No,” or what rooms he was in. I don’t know just where he went at
the police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Whatever happened to all those sandwiches? Did you eat
them up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, if I didn’t eat but one or two I would be a fool, wouldn’t I?
I mean look, I like corn beef and pastrami. I mean the windup was when he
got around to home, he didn’t have that many left already.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many did you see in those paper bags? You said you
saw 8 or 10 in the paper bags.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; but I can’t eat 8 or 10 sandwiches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let’s take a break.</p>

<p>(Short recess taken.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me now state for the record that we had a short break here
for refreshments, and Mr. Senator has had an opportunity to read a document
which is known as Exhibit 5402, which I had previously marked, and in reviewing
the documents which I have marked today, I find that I have dated
them April 23, 1964, when a look at the calendar tells me that the correct date
is April 22, 1964, and I have inked over the date so that it now reads April 22,
1964, on Exhibits 5400, 5401, 5402, and I have marked a further “Exhibit 5403,”
which exhibit is a copy of an FBI report prepared by Mr. Rawlings and Mr.
Glonek, of an interview that they had with Mr. Senator on December 19, 1963.</p>

<p>Now Mr. Senator, you have had an opportunity in this break period to read
over Exhibit 5402, which is a copy of a report prepared by Secret Service
Agent Elmer W. Moore which he had with you on December 3, 1963. Have
you had an opportunity to read that exhibit through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I ask you as we did with the previous exhibit to indicate if
there are any changes or corrections or clarifications that you would want
to make in Mr. Moore’s report, and I specifically point out again that what I
am directing my attention to here is whether Mr. Moore’s report is an accurate
report of what you told him on that day. I might also reiterate as we have
at the beginning of every session which has been resumed here that, of course,
we are taking this under the same procedures and formalities that we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
had since the beginning here, and that the oath which you took on Tuesday
morning is still in effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Now on this here, of course, this goes back many, many years.
This is just the location that is a location and not a name of a person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Point out what it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. “About 1934 he returned to Gloversville and left there with
neighbors, the Sebring family to go to Florida.” Now, Sebring, it is a city, not
people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You didn’t leave with the Sebring family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You left to go to Sebring, Fla.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Went to Sebring, Fla.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did you go to Sebring, Fla. with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The name was Eggens.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. They were neighbors from Gloversville?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; they were neighbors from Gloversville. They lived for
many, many years in Lake Placid, N.Y., and I went with them and, of course,
today their whereabouts—I know the mother is deceased—and where they are
I don’t know. I haven’t seen them in a zillion years.</p>

<p>“On August 21, 1941, he entered the Army Air Force and was assigned
serial number 12006042.” I probably should comment is off there. It doesn’t
really make any difference. “He served mainly as an aerial armorer with
the Fifth Bomber Command 33d Group in Australia and Pacific Theater during
World War Second.”</p>

<p>There is a correction on that. I was with the 22d Bomber Group 33d Bomb
Squadron. That is the only correction on that, if you want that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; that is fine because we are happy to have that. In fact
why don’t you take your pen and make that correction right on the piece of
paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. How can I get it on there, they are so close together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Cross out something and write it in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. To go through this whole thing I would have to say I was
with the Fifth Air Force, Fifth Bomber Command. Well, the Fifth Bomber
Command is there. Do you want Fifth Air Force?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there something that is inaccurate in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The only thing is I was with the 22d Bomb Group, 33d Bomb
Squadron.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So what you want to do is write out in the margin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Do you want me to cross this out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don’t you just change the 33d Group to 33d Squadron.
Change group to squadron, and then add what the bomber group was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. 22d Bomber Group.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; with a little caret or asterisk being there to indicate
where you want it to go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know how important it is, if you want the Fifth Air
Force before or we can eliminate it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In order to identify that group that you were <span class="locked">in——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In other words, it relates this way. You start off Fifth Air
Force, Fifth Bomber Command, if you want this whole thing, 22d Bomb
Group when I was with the 33d Bomb Squadron if you want that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Write Fifth Air Force in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Do you want that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know where to put it. Do you want me to put it on
top here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Fifth Air Force comes first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So we have edited this to read “He served mainly as an aerial
armorer with the Fifth Air Force, Fifth Bomber Command, 22d Bomb Group,
33d Squadron in Australia and Pacific Theater during World War II.” Why
don’t you initial and date the changes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Is one sufficient for the whole?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Put a set of initials and date by each one and remember it is
April 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think there is one I put on the 23d come to think of it somewheres
on something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We will try to find that. I think you did make that change.
You didn’t date the previous change made on Exhibit 5401.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am writing 4-23 here. It is 4-22. Can I put in here and say
“He was honorably discharged” or just “discharged satisfactory.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Go ahead, if you want to clarify it to say honorably discharged.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. There is a difference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; there is and I can understand why you would want that
in there. Now you have made some other changes on here I notice. You have
added on page 2 of Agent Moore’s report in the first sentence the word
“Honorably” so that that sentence reads “He was honorably.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I should say honorably discharged.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Honorably discharged as a staff sergeant on September 9, 1945.
In the first full paragraph on this page, the last sentence you have changed the
spelling of the name Wexler from W-e-x-l-e-r to W-e-c-h-s-l-e-r, and that is the
name of the man to whom your former wife is now married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am the one who gave him that other spelling because I didn’t
spell it right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In the second paragraph on that same page, the last sentence,
you have added the words “Texas Postcards and Novelty, Dallas, Texas” before
the words “Dexter Press, West Nyack, New York” so that that sentence reads:
“He is presently a salesman of colored postcards for Texas Postcard and
Novelty, Dallas, Texas, Dexter Press, West Nyack, New York.” Now let me ask
you this. Are the Texas Postcard and Novelty Company and Dexter <span class="locked">Press——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Excuse me, they make the cards, they print the cards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So what you really do is you sell these cards for Dexter Postcard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No: I don’t sell them for Dexter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You sell them for Texas Postcard and Novelty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. From Dexter Press?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Dexter are the ones who make prints.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me add the word “from.” I have added the word “from.”
I will hand you back Mr. Moore’s report. Why don’t you continue on through it
and read whatever it is that you think should be changed and then we will
make the changes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This “He made business calls and stopped for lunch at a place
called Jacques,” now shall I put in front of <span class="locked">lunch——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It is understood you didn’t have anything to eat but had something
to drink. A cocktail or something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think I had two bottles of beer. Do you want that changed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don’t you cross out “lunch” and say “two bottles of beer.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Now maybe I said I had lunch. I don’t even remember. I
ain’t going to question this. You know that I just changed that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You changed lunch to what? What did you write, two bottles
of beer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. “Two beers.” Just a misspelling of a street here. Do you want
that corrected?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; if you would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. With the same category as the beer place, the name of the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes, correct the spelling. What is the name? You have changed
the word Carol Street on page 3 from C-a-r-o-l to C-a-r-r-o-l-l. That is fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Do you want that initialed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; if you would please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. “He returned to the apartment and went to bed approximately
10:30 p.m. He does not recall seeing Ruby again that day.” It is not recall
seeing him, I didn’t see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why don’t you change recall to didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Now I stated here for the point of information before that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
“Jack told him” which is me “that he had been at his sister Eva’s place,” said
that he had bought food for her.” In other words, when he bought all this
stuff there he bought her some too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In other words, it was your understanding when you talked
with Agent Moore that Jack had bought the sandwiches and so forth before he
went to Eva Grant’s house on Friday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; now let me ask you this. When I am talking to them,
are they taking this word by word or what? Do you know? I don’t even
know myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It depends. Of course I wasn’t at this interview.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I know that. This is why I asked you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. They are obviously not taking it down word for word as our
court stenographer is here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I know they do it in longhand which is tough. It is not easy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He is taking notes which hopefully are going to be accurate.
After all, these men are highly trained people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am certain they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. They are trained to take notes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am certain they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And to do it as accurately as they can. But there are mistakes
that crop up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Who isn’t fallible somewhere or another. I think there is a
misinterpretation of this word that “he had bought food for her.” Brought
food for her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would it make any difference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not in all reality, I don’t know, because when he bought all
this food, if you asked me how much he bought I don’t know but apparently, I
have been under the impression that he bought quite a bit of things, because if
he took food over to the police station, he couldn’t go there with six or seven
sandwiches I know if he was working of that nature, to bring food over there.
So I assumed there must have been many, many sandwiches and pastries of
some nature that he had brought over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am interested, Mr. Senator, in this. That even in this interview
with Mr. Moore on the 3d of December you don’t make any reference about
Jack telling you that he went to the police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Maybe I forgot that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And that is why I ask you again if it is not possible—now
this interview was not under the same kind of pressure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; that is right. You are right on that. All I can say is
maybe it is just a thing that slipped my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or is it possible that in fact all you remembered was that Jack
had said that he bought food for Eva, and that he hadn’t mentioned anything
about going to the police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; this is the same time when he bought all this stuff, when
he bought these bags. Mind you, when I mentioned about these bags, this is
the first time that I have even thought about this to anybody that I spoke to, see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now keep in mind the distinction between what <span class="locked">Jack——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Even though this thing slipped my mind all the way through
completely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; but try to focus on this distinction, the difference between
what Jack told you on Friday night or Saturday morning, and what you later
learned some time afterward. I ask you if it isn’t possible that you learned
about Jack’s going to the police station after you talked with Agent Moore, and
that that is the reason that you didn’t tell this to the police and you didn’t tell
it to the FBI and you didn’t tell it to Agent Moore, because you knew about the
sandwiches when you talked with Moore, and when you talked with the FBI,
and you knew about going to Eva’s, but at that point you didn’t know of any
connection between the sandwiches and the police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The only way that I can really express this, it could be a
probability and then it couldn’t, in other words, I can’t answer the question
truthfully and be sure. I say I am not sure. What else could I say on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, this is what we are trying to get at.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I still ain’t sure if I did or didn’t mind you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Because the thing that I want to explore here is <span class="locked">whether——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. But I knew about the sandwiches the next day because I saw
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You knew about the sandwiches, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But the thing I am trying to direct your attention at is whether
you knew about Jack’s visit to the police station and I am suggesting to you
that if you had known on the 23d or the 24th about Jack’s visit to the police
station, you would have had some further conversation with Jack. If Jack had
said, or if I had said to you, “George, I just was down to the police station and
I took some sandwiches down there” on this particular day, why you would
have said to me, “Did you see Oswald? What was going on? What kind of
investigation?” That visit to the police station would have been a more
important thing than the sandwiches. So that if Jack really told you this on
Saturday, the 23d, I am suggesting that there might be some further conversation
that you and he had, because you would ask him questions about what
he saw, out of curiosity, and you don’t seem to recall any such conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It is not fresh in my mind right now. I am inclined to think
that he did, but if I had to say 100 percent I really can’t answer you now. I just
don’t remember now. I was sort of under the impression that I was told. It is
hazy in my mind. I can’t say yes or no. I am not going to say no and I am not
going to say yes that he did or didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don’t have any clear recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Of any conversation about his being down at the police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t remember, so in other words this is a thing I would
have to leave in question. Here is a question that I am not even sure of.
“Senator said that Ruby was very hot about this article and commented that
Weissman did not spell his name as a Jew but if he were a Jew he should be
ashamed of himself.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is your feeling about that now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t ever remember telling him that. Now I don’t say that
I did or didn’t, but I don’t know why I had the reason to say that he didn’t spell
his name as a Jew. Wait a minute “that he did not spell his name as a Jew”
I just can’t figure why I would say that because Bernard Weissman to me
sounds Jewish no matter how I look at the name. This is the part I don’t
understand on this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it your recollection that Jack was hot under the collar about
this ad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, yes; oh, yes. This I remember he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You found that ad independently of Jack as I understand it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I found that ad Thursday night when I bought the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Thursday before the President arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Or was it Friday? Thursday or Friday. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Something makes you think it was Thursday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Maybe, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is that that makes you think that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Wait a minute. I may have bought this paper Thursday night
because it come out in the paper the day the President arrived when I read it.
Or did it come out Friday? I don’t remember. Was it Friday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Of course, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It was a Friday’s paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And the Friday morning news hits the newsstands on Thursday
night, does it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now are you in the habit of picking up a morning newspaper
the night before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It all depends the hour. If I am out at that hour and if the paper
is out at that hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what you did the night before the President came
to Dallas?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t know what I did Thursday at all. I don’t know
what I did. Now there is a little twist in the thing right now. After we saw
the paper and the poster, he has just got this twisted around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Read what he has and then let’s talk about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. “They went to the Southland Hotel Coffee Shop and had coffee,
Ruby drinking grapefruit juice. While there Ruby reread the ad and made
comments about it. They left the coffee shop and went to the main Dallas post
office on Ervay where Ruby rang the night bell.” Then it continues, but the
thing is this is reversed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What you are saying is that you went to the post office before
you had coffee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. This is reversed. Now does the reversal mean anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. There is a bunch that you have to reverse in this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let’s get it straight then as to what actually happened there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You want to reread it from here? It sounds all right except
the reversal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You read everything that is wrong, everything that is reversed
and so forth and then we will try to put it in proper order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The only thing I can do is read the reversal and leave the other
as it is. In other words, when he is doing this he would have to say this was
first and the other was last. I don’t know how to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You read the text that is improper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In other words, take these down in a line, is that what you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. From the point that it gets out of order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What I just read where it was out of order?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The only two things out of order, let me understand this, are
that you went to the post office before you went to the Southland Hotel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And so the discussion you had at the Southland Hotel about
the Weissman ad occurred after you saw the Earl Warren sign and after
you went to the post office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is right. Now do you want some change in here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; I think that is clear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Let me finish the balance of this. That whole complete thing
is right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We have corrected it on the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes. When he is quoting about a certain time, if it is an hour
off or a half hour off, is there any difference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, if you <span class="locked">have——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He says about which is all right. He has got a time there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you think your recollection now is more accurate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No, no. All I want to know when it says about. In other words,
that means approximately a certain time, in that area, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That is all. Let me ask you on something like this. Maybe
I ain’t reading this correct. “He said the fact that Ruby had the dog Sheba
to which he was very attached in the car when he went to the police station
alone would indicate that he intended to return soon.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. What is unclear about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It sounds like I was telling him that he went to the police
station. This is the way it sounds to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; it sounds to me like you are saying to Agent Moore that
because Jack had Sheba with him down there at the police station, you draw the
conclusion that Jack just went down there on a casual basis and intended to
come back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. All I know is that when he left the house he had Sheba with
him. That I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now do you draw any particular significance about his having
Sheba with him? Does the fact that he had Sheba with him suggest something
to you about Jack planning to kill Oswald and not planning——<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I’ll tell you how this sounds to me like unless I’m not reading
it. It sounds like I told him that when Jack went to the police office he had
Sheba with him. That is the way it sounds to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; what Agent Moore, I think, is suggesting, at least the way
I read <span class="locked">it——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You read it. Start with “He said.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, let’s read the sentence before that.</p>

<p>“Senator said there were several things that may not have come to the attention
of the authorities which would indicate to him that Ruby had not planned
to shoot Oswald. He said the fact that Ruby had the dog Sheba to which he was
very attached in the car when he went to the police station alone would indicate
that he intended to return soon. Also, the fact that he had the cash receipts
from the club in the car. Senator said he was convinced that Ruby had emotionally
worked himself up to such a pitch that when he saw Oswald in the
basement of the police station he went out of his head.”</p>

<p>Now as I read those sentences, what you are saying is that if anybody were
to learn of all of the facts that took place they should pay particular attention
to the fact that Ruby had his dog Sheba in the car when he went to the police
station, because that indicates that Ruby intended to come back from the police
station before he went down there.</p>

<p>Do you still feel that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That he intended to come back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That Ruby, if Ruby had intended—are you saying that if Ruby
had intended to shoot Oswald before he drove down to the police station, he
wouldn’t have taken Sheba along?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That isn’t what I said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is not what you said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. I said I read that like it sounds to me. I must be reading
it wrong but it sounds to me like I said he was going to the police station with
Sheba.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; we understand that you are not saying that at all. What
I am asking you is if you mean to say that in your mind Jack Ruby would not
have taken Sheba down to the police station with him if Jack Ruby ever intended
to shoot Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think he would; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But do you think he might have anyhow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know. I couldn’t answer that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you saying now as you think about this further, the fact
that he had the dog with him is not an overriding fact in deciding whether Jack
had any plan to shoot Oswald before he went down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. To my knowledge I would say that he had definitely no plans.
Now the money <span class="locked">part——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But would you say this, that if Jack Ruby had planned, let’s
assume for the sake of argument that Jack Ruby planned to kill Oswald before
he went down to the police station. Now if Jack had that plan in his mind, are
you saying he never would have taken Sheba along with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I definitely don’t think he would ever take the dog with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What would he have done with the dog?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I assume he would have probably, wherever he was going with
the dog, maybe he was going to the club or what it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why do you say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why do you say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, all I can say is I know how much he likes that dog, and
the dog is always with him, no matter where he goes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there any reason why <span class="locked">Jack——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No particular reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Jack wouldn’t figure that you or somebody else wouldn’t have
picked that dog up later and taken care of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or isn’t it possible that Jack just at this point forgot about the
consequences to the dog?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I can’t even answer that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then would you say that the mere fact that Jack had Sheba
with him doesn’t prove one way or another whether he planned to kill Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think he planned nohow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I know you don’t think that, but I want to know what significance
we should put on the fact that he had Sheba with him. As I understand what
you have been saying now, one could draw the conclusion that simply because he
had Sheba with him doesn’t prove conclusively one way or another that he
had a plan or didn’t have a plan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I can’t conceive anyhow that this man had any plans, nohow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If you knew that Jack Ruby had taken Sheba to the club and
locked her in the club and left instructions for somebody to take care of Sheba,
would that affect your attitude as to whether Jack planned to kill Oswald or
not? Would you still <span class="locked">say——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I would say it would still be of the same nature having the dog.
I don’t think he would do anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You just don’t think he planned to kill Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; definitely not. I just never could visualize it. I can’t
visualize anything like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You also say in this, Moore also reports in this statement this
language: “Also the fact that he had the cash receipts from the club in the car.”
Now I take it from that language that you are saying that you also think that
Jack would have taken the cash receipts back to the club if he had planned to kill
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The only thing I can say is that I would have to guess on
my own and say I can only surmise that he wouldn’t have had any cash with
him. That is what I would guess. I don’t know. First of all, he carries
money both ways, see. Now Jack has always been under the impression
wherever he goes, daytime or nighttime, that money, I don’t say all his money
but a certain part of money, what ever he puts in, is safe in the trunk. He
feels it is safe in the trunk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let’s suppose Jack Ruby had done this. Let’s suppose he had
taken his dog Sheba to the Carousel Club, left a note for somebody as to how
to take care of Sheba, and had taken all the money out of the back of his car
and locked it in the safe at the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. What safe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Didn’t he have a safe there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He bought a safe but it was never fixed. He bought a safe,
I’ll tell you the kind of a safe he bought. To my knowledge it has never been
put to use. He bought a safe that fits into the ground. Did you ever see these
little round things that fit into <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Well, this thing never materialized because the structure was
never made for the safe, never made into the ground. Now if he ever used
the safe I don’t even know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did Jack ever put his <span class="locked">money——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Excuse me. The reason I say I feel he didn’t, which I really
don’t know, I don’t think he did, because the safe was able to be carried. It
wasn’t that big thing but when you cement it around you can’t get to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you this. Was Jack in the habit of putting his
money in the bank?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In other words, Jack’s safe was his car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Not necessarily. He had it in his car, he had it in his pocket,
and he had it around the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you stated a while ago that Jack felt that if he had the
money locked in the trunk of the car that was as good as being in the safe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; I did, but I didn’t say all the monies. I said a certain
part of the monies. Now what part of it I don’t know, because I know he carried
some in there. I know he carried some in his pocket. I know he leaves some
at home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he leave any at home on the 24th?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. If he did I don’t know. I’ll tell you why, the reason I say that
is because he has in the living room that has got one of these self-locks. Did you
ever see these little locks on a door that you can lock. You know, you can
sort of snip it off? It comes off, whatever kind of lock you call it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. He has one of them. He had one of them in the living room.
See, his apartment that night was confiscated. I don’t know if it was the
local police. I don’t know who got in there. Somebody got in there, see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But it certainly wasn’t unusual, was it, for Jack to carry all
of his money on his person and in his car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; he has done that many times. But I’ll tell you, when
he is putting the money in his car he very seldom ever left it there for such
a lengthy time like that. But this was his safest place as far as not carrying
it all in his pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And he felt that keeping it in the car was safer than keeping
it in the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. This I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now you say this was the longest time that you can remember
Jack carrying a lot or that much money around with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Oh, no; I never said that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you mean to say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I never said that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In other words, there have been times when Jack, I take it there
have been periods of 3 days or more when Jack has carried $2,000 or $3,000?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Or more. No; this is an every day occurrence with him.
This is a thing that materialized 7 days a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So there is nothing unusual about Jack Ruby having all that
money in his automobile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; it is always like that. Now if he has any money in the
bank, I mean I can’t quote that because I don’t see that. See, he carries this
money around 7 days a week. Now what he has in the bank, of course, I
have quoted you that once before, I think that was yesterday, I don’t know
what he has got. Only when you ask what bank he has, when I mentioned the
Merchants State Bank, I don’t know if the guy has got $40 in there or $500, you
know what I mean? I don’t know.</p>

<p>Or whatever he has had in there or how he has had it. See, this is an unusual
man when it comes to this money bit. I don’t know how many times he asked
me, “George, where is my money?” making me feel like I took it but he always
misplaced it and always found it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is this a large sum of money that he misplaced?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Sometimes it could be missing $200 or $300 or $400, I don’t
know. Whatever the stake is, he has about 4, 5 or 6 different stakes in
different pockets. This man don’t remember where the money is. This may
sound crazy but it is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack own any real estate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; what is he going to use for money for the real estate?
A lot of people are under the impression that Jack had a lot of money. Jack
didn’t. Jack was, what would you classify him, as a walking bank?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He carried all his money on his person regardless of how much
it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; this man was making who knows, I don’t know how
much money he has got and I can’t break it down and say he is carrying 10, 5
or whatever. Who knows what he has got or how much it is. But there has
been 2, 3, 4, maybe more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What, hundred or thousand dollars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Thousands, whatever it is. Of course, as I told you, this all
goes to the rent, the help, the electricity, you know, all the utilities and things.
But he is a walking bank.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is this common knowledge that he carried all this money
around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. That was common knowledge to me. How many other people
knew it I don’t know but I am certain other people knew it. Look, when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
help all got paid off they were all paid off in cash. When they wanted to borrow
money they were all paid off in cash. Just like here I can’t quote how
much money he had at any time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now let me ask you to read over what I have marked
as Washington, D.C., April 22, 1964, George Senator Deposition, Exhibit 5403,
and I signed that. It is the report of Agents Rawlings and Glonek. Would you
read that over, and tell me, go through that in the same fashion as we have with
the others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are there any additions, corrections, or explanations that you
feel ought to be made to Exhibit 5403?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Let me go through this fast. I think there aren’t but let me
make sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you before we get into this, was that interview made
at your request?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I was sent for. Why would I request it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don’t know. Some people call the FBI and tell them they have
something more to tell them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I was sent for. I have had a pretty good amount of questioning
you know. I, like any other individual of the nature that I am, I don’t
think is too happy about all this. And who would be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now that you raise that, we might get on the record the fact that
I believe you have expressed to me at lunch during the last 2 days that you feel
that this is an unfortunate circumstance in your life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Certainly it is. It ain’t going to do my life any good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you explain? Would you want to convey some of the
feelings here on the record that you gave to me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I feel I will always be pointed at, if anybody knows my name
of the nature of the conditions that surrounds me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You feel a certain amount of shame or disgrace?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; let me say there will probably be a disturbance. They will
always point to Jack Ruby’s roommate, Jack Ruby’s roommate, something of
that nature, you know. What does phonetic mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That means that they don’t know whether the spelling is correct,
but without knowing how to correctly spell it that is the way they would write
it, from the sound. Mr. Senator, as you read through that if you come to anything
that you think ought to be modified or changed, why, point it out, because
I assume that the two pages that you have read so <span class="locked">far——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am reading it pretty fast. I am a little bit on the punchy
side, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If you want us to walk out and sort of relieve your mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; there is one item in here where it states “He carried his
money in a sack.” This is only partial. It was in his pockets, in the sack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The trunk of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The trunk of the car. No, no; mind you if it is in the sack it
goes in the trunk of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Anything else in that interview report that you would want
<span class="locked">to——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; I don’t know if this means anything, it is in his pocket, to
you I mean. I don’t know. This says here where he took the revolver and
placed it on the bag on top of the money. This is not <span class="locked">always——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did he place on the bag on top of the money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The gun on top of the moneybag. “Placed it in the bag on top
of the money.” To me it is not important. The gun may be next to it or something
like that, who knows where he put it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now let me ask you a couple of closing questions. One thing we
haven’t talked about here. That was, how many sets of keys did Jack Ruby
have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. To the clubs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have more than one key chain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think he had two small ones. I think one for the car, I’m not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
sure now. He had keys but I don’t know what they all fit you know. I think
he had one for the car and I think one for the place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he keep all of his car keys on one ring or did he have them
on two different rings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don’t know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have one billfold or more than one billfold?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have never seen a billfold.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You have never seen his billfold?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. You mean to carry his paper money in billfolds? No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Identification and things like that. Did he have a wallet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I don’t think he ever had a wallet. I don’t recall seeing any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever see his driver’s license?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Did I ever see his driver’s license?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Or social security.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When he got undressed at night did he put his billfold—what
did he do with <span class="locked">his——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I never seen his billfold. I think he carries them—what he
carried these things in, he had a little thing, you know a little thing that opened
up and you slide it to one side or the other, sort of like what, a little money fold.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Sort of like an accordian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No; it didn’t even open up like that. In other words it opened
up like a covered book or one of these little things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have identification in that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I never seen into it. It could be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it the type of thing you could put identification in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am certain he probably could have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you recognize it if you saw it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. The thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; that you describe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I am not sure. I might. I couldn’t say positive. As a matter
of fact even the coloration, I wouldn’t know if it was green or black.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have any habit of leaving car keys in his automobile that
you know of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think only at the garage. See, the garage is right downstairs
from the club next door, which they watch his car constantly because he has
rented this place on a monthly basis which he has had for I don’t know how
long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And where would he leave the keys then, in the ignition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I think the keys were left in the ignition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall if you ever had occasion to look in the glove compartment
of Jack’s car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have looked at it but it is such a jingle-jangle there that it
didn’t mean anything as far as opening it up. There was so much gook in
there, do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes. Did you ever have any occasion to look in the trunk of
his car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have seen the trunk open; yes, and that is another slop
house, with a bunch of garbage in there. I told him a thousand times “How
can you open your trunk and not clean it up? How can you keep that garbage
in there.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What sort of things would he keep in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. There would be papers. In other words, things weren’t placed.
You take a tire, you think the tire is in the right place? It could be any
place in that thing there, and all the other garbage that he had in there, and
papers, whatever it is. He kept his car like he kept his apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don’t have any knowledge, or do <span class="locked">you——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. I have never gone through his trunk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As to what he had in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. In the trunk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. No. To me it looked like a bunch of garbage he had in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you ever had occasion to drive his automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; but very seldom because he didn’t want me to handle
it and I’ll tell you why. No insurance. That is why he didn’t want me to
drive his car. Very seldom was I ever allowed to drive that car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. On the occasions when you drove his automobile, from where
did you get the automobile keys?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. From him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Off of his person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes; from the house, yes, when he was home. And sometimes
I would drive for him when he is tired, like he feels he is going to fall asleep,
and I have done this you know from the club to the apartment where he feels
he maybe fall asleep at the wheel. This is one of the things where he wouldn’t
let me drive because he had no insurance, and I wasn’t anxious to drive the car
on account of that either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now you and I have had lunch together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And we have had breaks here and on these occasions we have
talked and you have talked with Mr. Hubert also on these occasions. Is
there anything that we talked with you about in these times when we haven’t
had a court reporter present that we haven’t covered here in our deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. It would be hard for me to think what you have left out, you
know. I have never had a questioning like this in my life before. When
I originally came down here I thought I would only be here—I thought the questioning
would probably be similar to being questioned by the FBI or the Secret
Service. First of all how was I to know? What was I to expect, see? I
just couldn’t believe that I would be here 2 days. I couldn’t think how it was
possible where you could ask me so many questions, both of you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case you don’t recall anything dealing with the case,
an aspect of it that was the subject of a conversation which has not been discussed
on the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Offhand, I can’t. Offhand, I just can’t think of any because
I think you all know more than I know. If you can remember the Times
Square Cafeteria you know more than I know. You are not going to put that
too, are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me then ask this one final question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If anything should come to your attention in the future, which
pertains to the Ruby case that could be of assistance to us, will you contact
somebody in the Government and let them know so that we can have a complete
record here. He is nodding his head yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Senator</span>. Because he can’t write the nod down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you very much indeed for coming.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to say to him that it has been a pleasure to talk with
you; we think your cooperation has been most helpful.</p>

<h2 id="RICH">TESTIMONY OF NANCY PERRIN RICH</h2>
</div>

<p>The testimony of Nancy Perrin Rich was taken at 11 a.m., on June 2, 1964,
at 200 Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C., by Messrs. Burt W. Griffin
and Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Nancy Perrin Rich.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rich, my name is Leon D. Hubert. I am a member of the advisory staff
of the general counsel of the President’s Commission on the Assassination of
President Kennedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
Under the provisions of the President’s Executive Order No. 11130, dated
November 29, 1963, the joint resolution of Congress 137, and the rules of procedure
adopted by the President’s Commission in conformance with that Executive
order and that resolution, I have been authorized to take a sworn deposition
from you.</p>

<p>I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is
to ascertain, evaluate, and report upon the facts relevant to the assassination
of President Kennedy, and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>In particular as to you, Mrs. Rich, the nature of the inquiry today is to
determine what facts you know about the death of Oswald, any participation
in that death, or the death of President Kennedy by Jack Ruby, certain particular
activities of Jack Ruby which you have heretofore told the FBI, and
other pertinent facts you may know about the general inquiry.</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Rich, I think you appear today here by virtue of a letter written
to you by Mr. J. Lee Rankin, general counsel of the staff of the President’s
Commission, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that—when did you receive that letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I actually received in my hands the letter yesterday, Monday,
the 1st. I received notification of it via a telephone call from Mr. Fahety of
the FBI Bureau, Boston, notifying me of it.</p>

<p>It was sent—and at this time I would like to state—and opened by Mr. Rod
Kennett, of Executive Limited, 100 Boylston Street, Boston, and there was no
possible way that letter could have been opened erroneously. It could not have
even by any stretch of the imagination been misconstrued as being office literature.
It was personally addressed to me, with the President’s Commission
on it.</p>

<p>I want that in the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I also want it in the record I came here of my own free will.</p>

<p>Also that I don’t want it known and that I would like Kennett cautioned
to be quiet about this. I want someone to caution the Kennetts to keep quiet
about this. Rod opened the letter, and he has been telling everybody in Boston
about it. I don’t particularly want it known.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I am not in a position to pass upon your request. But I am
quite certain that the Commission will take it into account.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I would appreciate it, because of some extracurricular work that
I do—it is not feasible for anyone to know that I go before any kind of commission,
for anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, let me get back to this. Under the rules adopted
by the Commission, you are entitled to a 3 day written notice prior to the
taking of this deposition. But the rules also provide that a witness may waive
the 3-day written notice if he so desires. And I ask you now if you wish to
waive the 3-day notice.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; I will waive it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, will you stand, please, so I may administer the oath?
Raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are
about to give in this matter will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you please state your full name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Nancy Elaine Perrin Rich.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand that you recently married.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your husband’s name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Francis L. Rich.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you reside?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No. 16 River Road, Hanover, Mass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When were you married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. April 11, 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Prior to that time, I think you had been married to a man by the
name of Perrin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Robert L. Perrin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he died?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. August 29, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you had been married prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; I had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the name of the husband you were married to prior
to the time you married Mr. Perrin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Husbands, in plural. <span class="locked">Louis——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean there are more than one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Give us the names.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Louis Edward Musachio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Before you pass away from him to the other husband, would
you tell us how your marriage was dissolved?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. By divorce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he your first husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. He was my second.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your second husband. And is he still alive?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; I gather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know where he lives?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; I don’t. The last known address was Lackland Air Force
Base. I believe he is retired out of the service since then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What business was he in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Air Force, a sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long were you married to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Married, I couldn’t exactly say. I guess a year. I actually lived
with him about 9 months. Eight of those were spent on various—he spent in
various hospitals, including Walter Reed here, for operations, and in the psychiatric
locked ward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When were you divorced from him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Oh, dear. 1961, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. In the county of Adams, city of Brighton, Colo.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were you married to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I was married at L. G. Hanscomb Air Force Base, Bedford, Mass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about your first husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. My first husband was Charles G. Wilson. He <span class="locked">was——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you marry him, and where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, I married him in Berwick, Maine, in 1953.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how was that marriage dissolved?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. In divorce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When and where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. 1955, in Biddeford, Maine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how old are you, Ma’am?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I am 27.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what is your present occupation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Housewife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You do not work for Executives Unlimited?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Not any more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did work for them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you work for them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Oh, about 3 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you cease working for them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Upon my marriage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which is April 11?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. April 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What sort of business was that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. An employment agency.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where is it located?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. 100 Boylston Street, Boston, Mass., Suite 309.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I have four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you state their ages and tell us by which husband they
were born?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I will start with my youngest. Diedre Pilar Perrin, age 4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And she is the daughter <span class="locked">of——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Robert L. Perrin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Felicia Helen Musachio, whereabouts unknown, by Louis Edward
Musachio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old is she?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. She would be 5.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when you say whereabouts unknown, you mean you do not
know the whereabouts of the child or of her father?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Both. She was, to quote the FBI, not kidnapped, childnapped.
Although I hold legal custody of her, I cannot find her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Will you go on to the others?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Brian Russell Wilson, age 7, and Valerie Dawn Wilson, age 10,
both by Charles G. Wilson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do these children live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The two Wilsons reside in Biddeford, Maine, with my parents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your father and mother?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct. The whereabouts of Felicia is unknown. And
Deidre Perrin resides with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your present husband’s occupation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. He is the owner of North Quincy Taxi Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is <span class="locked">located——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. In Quincy, Mass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long has he been so occupied?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Oh, 20 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the occupation of Robert Perrin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Many things, from a master mechanic, on heavy equipment, cats,
et cetera, to a master foundry worker, patternmaker, moulder, to running a
foundry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And other things?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. A writer, contracted by the old Street and Smith Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A writer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. He is an author, short stories. Anything beyond that, I couldn’t
tell you, because I don’t know how much is true of what he told me of his past.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he tell you of his past?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. May I ask a question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; if you wish.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. All of this is confidential?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I cannot give you the assurance that it is.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Meaning this would not be publicized for the entire world, so to
speak. The average person outside of who it directly would be reported to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I cannot give you the assurance that you ask for on that point.
If you would prefer not to answer the question, in the light of your feelings
about it, and the statement I have just made to you, then we can pass on to
another point.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Let me ask you this. Is it pertinent and important that you
know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Very well. Well, he claimed <span class="locked">to——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you understand, I am not giving you any assurance that
there will not be available to the public a transcript of this testimony.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I understand this. I thoroughly understand this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, he claimed to have worked for Jack Dragna, presently
residing at San Quentin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say he is in the penitentiary?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know for what offense?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Income tax evasion. I suppose. I don’t know for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Let me state at this time that half of what I am about to say—I
am sorry—all of what I am about to say is hearsay. Half, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We understand that. You are telling us what he told you he
had done in the past, but that you don’t know for sure whether it is true.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct. But I want that in the record. That he did
everything from handle Dragna’s call girls to be a heavy, so to speak.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you mean by a heavy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, bodyguard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Bodyguard for whom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Jack Dragna, and various subsequent members, shall we say,
of the organization that used to come into California.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What organization was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Call it by what you will—syndicate, Mafia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who were some of the people involved?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I could not tell you. I do know that he mentioned that he personally
knew Mickey Cohen and Virginia Hill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know any other names?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Jimmy Gilreath.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would G-i-l-r-e-a-t-h be about right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I would assume so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So what you are telling us is that your former husband, now
deceased, Robert Perrin, had told you that among other things he acted as
bodyguard for certain members of a syndicate, as you call it, and you have named,
I think, four people who belonged to the syndicate.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Supposedly, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what was the syndicate about, from what you learned
from your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, everything from prostitution to illegal gambling to narcotics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, all of this you know by hearsay alone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. By hearsay alone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I ask you that question because a moment ago you said that half
of what you said was hearsay.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I assume that the other half was not.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I do know this, that he claimed that he ran guns—this was years
ago, when Franco was coming into power. I do know this to be a fact, because
he spent time in jail there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did he spend time in jail?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. In Spain. I do know he fought for both sides, as a professional
soldier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say you know that, I take it that you mean that he
told you so.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; I do not mean that, sir. I mean I have seen written proof of
this statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Such as what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Such as a prison record. Now, let me qualify that. I have seen
said statement on record, call it what you may. Now, how authentic it was,
I cannot swear to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean he showed you a prison record?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I found it. From stuff in Spain—both Madrid, and a place called
Consuela.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What sort of a prison record was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. It wasn’t as you would think of a prison record. It was merely
a piece of paper in Spanish with a list of articles on it that was on his person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
at the time he was arrested. Another one was of a release signed by a Teniente
Enriquez, which would be a lieutenant here, at the Madrid Secreto Servicio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you better spell all that out, because you are using a
foreign language, and I am not sure that the reporter can get it except by the
sound.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. All right. To clarify this, it was written in Spanish. I will quote
it in English. “An article list, signed by Lieutenant Enriquez.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is his last name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; a release signed by someone in the Secret Service, which is
comparable to our detective system on a city police force.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was a lease of what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. A release.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you talk to him about these documents?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. He seemed quite proud of the fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I gather from that that you did talk to him about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I did. Quite frankly, I asked him what in the heck it was all
about. At that time, he claimed, he said, “Well, you won’t believe me. I wasn’t
making it up.” He claimed he ran guns and used to pilot a small boat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Ran guns where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Into Spain, for Franco.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the date of that document? Did it have any
date on it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I would say it was in the late thirties, I wouldn’t be sure, late
thirties or early forties. It was either just prior to him going into the United
States Army or after he was released. Now, I cannot be sure on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You think that it could not have been earlier than, say, 1935?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No, it could not have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why are you sure of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. For the simple reason he was born in 1920. It couldn’t have been
much prior to 1935. It was either late thirties or early forties. Again, I would
like to, for the record, state that my husband was a writer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are talking about Perrin now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes. And had a vivid imagination, as most writers do. Whether
or not these were authentic documents, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he die a natural death?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Suicide. The coroner’s report was arsenic. I also would like to
state for the record at this time after my husband’s death the Veterans’ Administration
Hospital, I believe it is the one in Denver, that finally came up with
the report, came up with the report that my husband was discharged from the
service for hysteria, and had a history of mental disturbance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you living with him at the time he died?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You state to us now that the coroner’s report in New Orleans,
I <span class="locked">suppose——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Showed that his death was caused by arsenic voluntarily consumed,
right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you lived part of the time that you were married to Perrin
in Dallas, did you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes. Why I am hesitant—I would like to clarify that statement.
I went to Dallas seeking Mr. Perrin. He had left me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were you living when he left you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. We were living in Belmont, Mass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What address?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No. 11 Holden Road.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long after he left you did you seek him out in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I was in New Hampshire with the state legislature at the time.
I was doing public relations. And I had just obtained a job, a position for him,
and I telephoned to Massachusetts to tell him to come on down, and there was no
answer. And I had a feeling that something was wrong. So I hightailed it back
to Massachusetts, and there was a note. And the note said that he was going to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
Dallas. I called and he wasn’t there. I called halfway over the United States,
thinking of places he told me he had been, and I couldn’t find him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What place did you call in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I called the police department and a foundry he had mentioned in
a letter, and had read the name of a gentleman he had mentioned at this time
whose name eludes me—Youngblood—I take it back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember his first name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; I don’t. But my husband claimed—and I couldn’t ask him,
because if he was he couldn’t have told me—claimed he was some sort of a
Government agent, which was in all probability true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you contact Mr. Youngblood?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; he hadn’t seen him. Then I proceeded to call Kansas City
and various other points I thought he might be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you actually contact the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you get any report from them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Except that he wasn’t there. Or that they didn’t know he was
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They did report that fact to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did they do so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. By phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I then informed him that I would be there, which I did. Subsequently,
Mr. Perrin—and I will never <span class="locked">understand——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long after the events you have just told us about, to wit,
your coming home and finding that he wasn’t there—how long after those events
did you go to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Approximately 1 week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. When was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Oh, gosh. That was in, I believe, May. I can’t give you the
exact month. But I believe it was in May.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of what year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Of 1961. Or was it 1962? ’62. I am sorry—1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how long—did you find Mr. Perrin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Again in a way. He wasn’t in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, afterwards, when he arrived in Dallas, I found out that
he had been in South Bend, Ind., with my secretary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, when did you meet him in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. He wrote mother, found out where I was—and came to Dallas,
I believe, it would be around July.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of 1962?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you had been there alone from May of 1962 until July of 1962?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I am giving approximate dates, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when he did arrive, what happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Just like nothing had happened. Everything was fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean there was a reconciliation between you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I loved my husband very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, in any case, you proceeded to live together as husband
and wife?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much education have you had, Mrs. Rich?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I have had 3 years of high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What high school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Biddeford High, in Biddeford, Maine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you leave there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I left when I was 16. That would be in 1954—1953—I am sorry.
And I got married, and I go back, and I drop out because I am going to have
a child. Then after I have the child I go back, and I am doubling up on my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
courses and could have graduated. But I was too smart, and knew everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you had any other type of training?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Depending on what you mean—formal education—meaning book
learning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or other types of training, such as stenography?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. IBM, and police investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the IBM aspect? Did you study that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I made a misquotation. It would be Remington Rand, actually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you study?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Not with Remington Rand as a company. For Craftsman Life
and Health Insurance Co. of Boston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You worked there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And studied the operation of Remington Rand machines there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us the name of some of the people you worked with
there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Oh, you are going back too far, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was that place located?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. On Boylston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the name of the manager?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. It may sound odd—whether this name has stuck in my mind
or not—but it seems to me his name is Griffin, too. I may be wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long were you there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Oh, probably 6 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was after you married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Oh, no. No—in fact, I was working there when I met Musachio.
That was back in 1958.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see. You had divorced your first husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you mentioned something else besides IBM.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Police investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, where did you learn that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. From various police organizations, district attorney’s offices.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you name them, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; some with the Boston Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who did you work with?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. We called him Papa McGill. Sergeant McGill, and John Dinatele,
I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you work there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, I was a young kid, and didn’t have any brains.
I blew a case, and that was it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you paid?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. At that time; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your answer suggests that at a later time you were paid.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With the same department?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, with what police department?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. With the district attorney’s office of Sacramento.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. California?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you work there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, this wasn’t a question of working. I worked as needed, or
as a case came up. I worked for Mr. Oscar Kistle, Chief Deputy District Attorney,
who as of this January is now a judge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you work with anybody else there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I worked with the Hayward Police Department, in California.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who did you work with there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Lieutenant—I can’t remember his name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you work with that police department?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, I left. That is why I discontinued my association with
them. Again, as needed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, altogether, how long were you there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Altogether, if you want to put it running day by day, probably 3
weeks. If you want to say—actually I was associated with them probably 3 or
4 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is what I meant.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. But not worked steadily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. And the Oakland Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oakland, Calif.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. California.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And who did you work with there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Oh, dear. I worked on grand theft. Lieutenant—I can’t remember—whoever
the lieutenant is in charge of grand theft detail. Lt. Parker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you stay in Oakland with that association?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Again, about the same length of time as Hayward. I was working
with both of them at the same time, and also Sacramento. In that type of work,
you cannot get by in just one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t think you mentioned Sacramento yet.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The district attorney’s office, yes, I have. At this time, if necessary,
I can introduce a letter into evidence verifying part of this testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, do you wish to do so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I believe I would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, do you have the letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I do. Note for the record I hand a letter to Mr. Hubert, signed by
Chief Deputy Kistle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have handed me this document. Do you wish—I assume you
wish to keep the original.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is the only one I have, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you mind if we had a copy made of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I would not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then we can hand you back the original.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That will be fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, when did you first meet Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. When I first reached Dallas, I, of course, went directly to the police
station. Ironically enough, the first person I met was Mr. Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is his first name? Are you referring to the Tippit who
was shot on November 22d?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I would say so. I believe it is the only Tippit on the police force.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. So you met Mr. Tippit. And what happened then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I walked in and plunked $4 on the desk and said, “Here I am.”
He <span class="locked">said——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. <span class="locked">Well——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. This was a joke. When I called him from Massachusetts, I told
him when I hit there I would have 4 bucks in my pocket. It was rather a kind of
a joke, actually. I said, “Here I am.”</p>

<p>He said, “Oh, no; I told you not to do it.”</p>

<p>I had talked to him previously on the phone. So that was all right. So he
called in one of the patrolmen. And they get the Black Maria, go down to the
bus depot and get my bags. And I had called Associated Press. I have many
friends around the press world. Being in public relations, I would. And this
Brice someone or other said, “You can go and stay with my wife for a couple of
days until you get settled.”</p>

<p>Three o’clock in the morning we start punching doorbells, with the suitcases in
a Black Maria, trying to find Ann, and I couldn’t remember the last name. So
the next day they send up to pick me up and help me find a place and job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say “they”——</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Meaning the police department of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What particular individuals?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I don’t recall exactly who sent them up. I cannot remember the
guy’s name. Really. I don’t believe he is any longer with them, I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, some person from the police department came to
get you the next day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes. Subsequently, one Mr. Paul Rayburn, detective, juvenile,
came to pick me up, along with his partner, Detective House. Well, we managed
to find a place to live. And Paul suggested he had a friend. And did I know
anything about bartending; well, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What place did he find you to live in? Do you remember the
address?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; I don’t. It was a rooming house. Actually, it was a private
home more or less cut into small apartments. I believe it was a three-room
apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how long did you live there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Here is where we are going to get into difficulty. I don’t remember.
I cannot remember the length of time or addresses I lived at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you live at more than one place prior to the time Mr. Perrin
joined you in July?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember any of the addresses of the places where you
lived?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, I remember I lived—when Mr. Perrin joined me I was living
on Oak Street, I believe. Then we moved to another street, and I don’t remember
where it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many places do you suppose you lived in prior to the time
Mr. Perrin joined you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Two, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. One was on Oak Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That was the one—let’s put it this way. Two including the one
I was living at when he joined me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And one was on Oak Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes. That was the big apartment building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the other was a rooming house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, I call it a rooming house. Perhaps I have named it incorrectly.
I would say a private home cut up into small apartments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you don’t remember where that was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I cannot remember. I can remember the house. I would probably
know it if I see it. It is outside the city a little ways. It wasn’t right in the
heart of downtown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the name of the lady who owned the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, the other was an apartment building, you say.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes. I believe—now, put this as supposed—I believe it was 1136
Oak Street, but I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that both places were on Oak Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No, no. The one on Oak, I think, that was the address. I don’t
recall what the first one was that Mr. Rayburn put me into.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s see if I get this straight. You lived in a boarding house
which was a house cut into small units, you say, and you don’t know where that
was located.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how long did you stay there, do you suppose?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Oh, maybe 3 or 4 weeks, 2 weeks, 3 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After which, as I understand, you then went to the larger apartment
house.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; on Oak Street, apartment row, where all these big luxury
apartments are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was on Oak Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Oak Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you stayed there until Mr. Perrin joined you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes. And for a while after. Until we found a place comparable
but at less money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And where was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That I don’t remember. Junios Street. I remember it didn’t have
a pool—it was a big brick apartment. Again, all of these places I can close my
eyes and picture. But I cannot tell you. I can’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you live there with Mr. Perrin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. At the last address that I don’t remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; ma’am.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Probably 3 or 4 months. I think we left Dallas in October and
went to New Orleans—either late October or early November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Of 1962. Now, this is where I am getting confused. It had to
have been 1961. This is where I get confused. When I stated before that it
was May of 1962, it wasn’t. It was May of 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why do you make that correction now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, it couldn’t have possibly been in 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. My husband died in August of 1962, in New Orleans. And we had
been there over a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had been in New Orleans over a year by the time he died?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Almost a year. Between New Orleans and Boston, and Miami.
You <span class="locked">see——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you leave Dallas, then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. It would be October of 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That you left Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And all of these previous dates, May and July, you now wish
to <span class="locked">correct——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. To 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you lived with Mr. Perrin after leaving Dallas in October of
1962—of 1961?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You lived in New Orleans most of the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he died there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct. You see, it was New Orleans and Boston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, I had asked you when you had first met Jack Ruby,
and I think you were beginning to tell us when we got into the question of your
residences. So now will you tell us how you met Jack Ruby, and when?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The when I could not tell you exactly. Some time during May or
June, I believe. Mr. Ruby’s records could tell you, due to the fact that I believe
he probably took social security out. But the how was that Mr. Rayburn took
me up and got me the job up there. Detective Rayburn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, how long after you had arrived in Dallas did you meet
Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Again, the time element eludes me. It could be anywhere from
2 or 3 weeks to a month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is your thought that it might be that long after you arrived
in Dallas under the circumstances that you told us about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I don’t know. A week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks. The last few years
time has become nothing for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, what was your occupation with Ruby, and where
was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I was bartender at the Carousel Lounge, on Commercial—well, the
main street in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Commerce?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Commerce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What were some of the names of the other people who worked
with you at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Buddy King—I should say his professional name is Buddy King—Robert
J. Stewart. I am trying to think of the name of that MC. I have been
trying to think of it, and I cannot. Ray something or other, I believe. They
came and they went.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long were you employed by Ruby altogether?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Probably a couple of months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you work with Ruby after your husband joined you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you work until you left Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long before leaving Dallas did you quit the job at Ruby’s?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Possibly a couple of months, 3 months. I wasn’t in Dallas more
than maybe 5 months, 4 months at the most, 4 or 5 months at the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when you say bartender, what do you mean? What were
your actual duties?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I was actually a bartender. I worked behind the bar mixing
and serving drinks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What sort of drinks?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Whatever was allowed. Actually, you are not allowed to serve
mixed drinks there. We do to special customers. You are not allowed to serve
hard liquor. But I served beer, and wine, of course, and your setups.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What customers did you serve hard liquor to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Whomever I was told to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know their names?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I couldn’t quote you names, perhaps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who told you to serve them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Mr. Ruby. It was a standing order. For a particular group of
people. Then whenever he would come in and say, “This is private stock stuff,”
that would mean for me to go where I knew the hard liquor was and get it
out, and get it ready for the people in his private office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the particular group—who did it consist of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The police department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you saying that Jack Ruby told you that when any member
of the police department came in, that there was a standing order that you
could serve them hard liquor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And are you also saying that you did so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I am saying that I needed a job and did so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the names of any particular officers to whom
you served hard liquor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. House, <span class="locked">Rayburn——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s see if we can get some first names.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I don’t remember what House’s first name was, but it was Paul
Rayburn, and Detective—something House—they were partners. They worked
as a team, juvenile. And the rest were just faces and uniforms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How would you know them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. At that time, I knew them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You knew them to be police?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they pay?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Oh, no; of course not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that an order, too, from Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That was. Unless they came in in the evening with their wives.
Then, of course, they paid. But then again, they didn’t have hard liquor, either,
at that time. This is when they came in, by themselves, I was to go get the
private stock, as he called it, special stock. They were served whatever they
wanted on the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that widespread?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I am not sure I understand what you mean by widespread.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you have mentioned two names, and then said there were
others whose names you don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, the only reason I remember House and Rayburn is because
they were personal friends of mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, how many others do you suppose you served?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I couldn’t estimate. I couldn’t give you a true and accurate figure.
Anyone that came in from the police department. Including certain attorneys in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
town. One attorney I particularly remember was a fellow named Sy Victorson,
who subsequently became my attorney, and a personal friend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. And a personal friend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your salary there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I don’t remember. $50, $60 a week, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any tips?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Sometimes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember a man by the name of Andy Armstrong or
Andrew Armstrong?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The name Armstrong doesn’t ring a bell. I guess, if my memory
serves me correctly—wasn’t the colored man that cleaned up around there,
Andy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that the way you remember him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I wouldn’t swear to it. I do know we had a colored man cleaning
up, but I would be darned if I remember his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You think it may have been Andy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I can’t remember. I wouldn’t even dare venture a guess. In all
honesty, I would have to say I can’t really put a face to the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But there was a colored man there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; there was a colored man that cleaned up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he stay on in the afternoon and at night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What were your hours?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I believe I would come in around 3, 4, 5 o’clock, I think, sometimes I
would come in at 6, or 7; I would work straight through to midnight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was this cleanup man present when you came in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. If I came in the afternoon, yes, the colored man was there. As I
say, in all honesty, I could not dare venture a name on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you don’t remember any colored man who was there helping
at the bar in the night hours?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. You don’t notice them. I mean they are there. If you have been
a bartender, you would know what I mean. You don’t notice people like that.
They are taken for granted they are there, you have a bar helper. Heck, I don’t
remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, what you are saying is that you do not remember that there
was any colored man who assisted with the bar at night.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I will be darned if I can even put a face to whoever did bring the
bottles and stuff out to me, the cases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your answer to my question, then, is that you do not remember
that there was a colored man other than the cleaner that you mentioned.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, he did everything. I do remember he lugged beer cases out
for me. I think if my memory is right—I think he stacked my cooler for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would he leave before you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I don’t really remember. As I say, these people you take for
granted, you don’t pay any attention to them. I never gave it a second thought.
I had one thing on my mind, and it went against my grain. I was doing something
I knew to be illegal, and I knew I needed the job. Every night I expected
a raid. That was my prime concern.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you know a man by the name of Ralph Paul?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Ralph Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; Ralph Paul.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. If he is the one I am thinking of, he was the manager at Earl’s
Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Earl who?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Earl’s Club. I don’t know what Earl’s last name was. I forgot.
It is a private club in Dallas. But I knew him as Ralph Lee. Oh, I don’t think
it is the same one. Again, I would remember people if I saw their faces. Names
I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know a person by the name of Eva Grant?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was she?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, she managed Jack’s other club; his sister managed the
Vegas Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever meet her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. One time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. She came in at the club there one time, was introduced as his
sister, and that she managed the Vegas Club, which I had never been out to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any difficulty with Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Except the fact I was about ready to throw a cash register on his
head, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I shouldn’t have said that. I said except for the fact that I was
ready one night to throw a cash register on his head, no. I don’t like to be
pushed around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you suggesting that he did push you around?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I am suggesting he threw me up against the bar and put a bruise
on my arm, and only because Bud King and one of the dancers there pulled me
off, I was going to kill him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the argument about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The bar glasses were not clean enough to suit him. And I
wasn’t pushing drinks to the customers fast enough.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And so he remonstrated with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. He did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that included pushing you around?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct. And I was refused the privilege of bringing an
assault and battery suit against him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who refused you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The police department. I went down for information and was
going to Mr. Douglas—I believe he was—he is some attorney—I think he was—he
is with the DA’s office. I don’t remember his position. I can’t remember
his last name. I wanted to file suit against Ruby. And I was refused. I was
told if I did that I would never win it, and get myself in more trouble than I bargained
for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was told to you by whom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. By the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But what individual of the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Again—and I wish to God I could—I can’t remember his name.
There was a detective, plainclothesman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you say that you had spoken to someone in the district
attorney’s office?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; I said that is who I was going to go to. I wasn’t advised.
I was flatly told not to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you did not go to anyone in the district attorney’s office?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did that put an end to your employment with Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; I had already ceased with Ruby the night that that happened.
I walked out, and left him cold.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is what I mean.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After this altercation, you no longer worked for him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I did not. I was just biding my time until I found another
job, which I did find. This was on a Wednesday. I was going to give him
notice and leave him—I wasn’t going to leave him over the weekend, but I was
going to start the other place the following Monday anyway. And this just
hastened it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you report that to your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was employed in Dallas at that time, I think you said.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. At this time, I don’t recall whether he was working for Paul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
Rayburn, Detective Rayburn, at his used car lot, or whether he was with Al’s
Automotive. One of the two places.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What sort of a job did he have?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Mechanic. Subsequently my husband went up and Jack Ruby
threw him out of the club. My husband was going to talk to him. And I found
out about it. Ruby had already kicked him out of the club. And then I
disuaded him from going back further. I said, “Forget it, just let it drop.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any other employment in Dallas after this altercation
with Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes, I did. At the—I think it was called just The Chalet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was it located?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Again I can’t remember. Again it was on the other side of Dallas.
It was outside—in fact, I don’t thing it was right in Dallas proper. It wasn’t in
Dallas proper, I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What sort of work did you do there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. This was a dining place. And I was a hostess. And in the place
they had this little booth, and they had a dart game, and you could throw darts
and win prizes, and I also ran that place for them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was your employer there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Again, I cannot recall his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long were you there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Until I left Dallas—probably a month. Then we left to go back to
New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long were you unemployed—that is to say, what period was
there between the time you left Ruby and the time you got this employment at
The Chalet?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Between the time I left Ruby and the time I went to The Chalet,
about 5 or 6 days. And then I quit The Chalet a little before we left. And,
of course, prior to going to Ruby’s I wasn’t employed. Then there was a period
of about a week, week and a-half, while I was at Ruby’s, all of a sudden he
decided he didn’t need a bartender. Then I am recalled back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You left The Chalet about a week before you left Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Probably a little more than that. Maybe 2, 2½ weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why did you leave The Chalet?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, for one thing he was going to close down for renovations.
And then he said, “no, I am not; I am going to sell out.” And he decided to
close it down anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you work for a place called the Theater Lounge?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Barney Weinstein—yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That was during the time I had left Ruby and then went back to
Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you work for the Theater Lounge?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No more than a week or two. I forgot all about working for
Barney. I have to laugh. His brother owned the other stripping place in town,
right next to Ruby, upstairs. And they had this amateur show, these amateur
strippers. Barney was going to promote me as a stripper. No thanks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, before we get into any other matter, I want to
go back to the letter that you handed me which was dated October 25, 1963. It
is addressed, “To Whom it May Concern:”</p>

<p>It purports to be signed by Oscar Kistle, chief deputy, district attorney. It is
on stationery of the office of the District Attorney of Sacramento County. I have
had a Xerox copy made of it. I have returned the original to you, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I am marking the Xerox copy of that document for identification
by writing on the right-hand margin the following words; to wit: “Washington,
D.C., June 2, 1964, Exhibit No. 1, Deposition of Nancy Perrin Rich,”
under which I have signed my name, and in order that the record may show that
there is no misunderstanding about it, I wonder if you would sign your name as
I have mine.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; I would. Note for the record that on the left-hand margin I
signed “Nancy E. Perrin Rich.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think the letter that you handed me was in an envelope, which
was plain, other than the fact that it had in the left-hand upper corner the words
“Office of District Attorney, Room 204, Courthouse, Sacramento 14, California”.
I am marking a Xerox copy of the original of that envelope, which has been
returned to you, for identification by writing on the Xerox copy the following, to
wit: “Washington, D.C., June 2, 1964, Exhibit 2, Deposition of Nancy Perrin
Rich,” under which I have signed my name, and I ask you to sign yours as you
did with reference to Exhibit No. 1.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Note for the record that I signed Nancy E. Perrin Rich under Mr.
Hubert’s signature.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Nancy E. Perrin Rich Exhibits 1 and
2 for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you, ma’am.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. At this time I would also, pertaining to my statement concerning
working for various police organizations, introduce into this informal hearing,
so to speak, another piece of material given to me by the Oakland Police Department
while working on a case for them, under the name of Julie Anne Cody.
Also under this name is a police record purposely devised by the Oakland Police
Department for obvious purposes, to coincide with this card that I am about to
hand to Mr. Hubert—also, how shall we say it—falsified, made up by the Oakland
Police Department, for obvious purposes. This was to get me into a particular
place—I had to have a police record—all done with the sanction of the Oakland
Police Department. May I also note that on that card the dates and the names
are fictitious, intentionally so. The card was in reality printed in, I believe,
November of 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say you want to introduce this card into this proceeding?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes. And I will tell you why. If you note the date on that, some
of my statements—Let’s say that this came into light, and I didn’t give the explanation
of why and what this meant—the dates would conflict with some of
my testimony. And I want this understood that this was purely done to, shall
we say, consummate a case for the Oakland Police Department. I was not
actually in California the dates on that card.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was this card issued to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. In reality, this card was issued in November of 1963. I was
working on a grand larceny case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You want this card back, the original?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Now, as soon as we have a Xerox copy made of the
card, we will identify it and sign the copies as we have done the other.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, let us pass on to another point. I think you have mentioned
that you saw Ruby at a certain meeting at which your husband was present
and there was a general discussion of guns or Cuban refugees.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Your statement is partially correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you tell us what is actually correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. At the first meeting there were four people present. There was
a colonel, or a light colonel, I forgot which. I also forget whether he was
Air Force or Army. It seems to me he was Army. And it seems to me he
was regular Army. There was my husband, Mr. Perrin, myself, and a fellow
named Dave, and I don’t remember his last name. Dave C.—I think it was
Cole, but I wouldn’t be sure.</p>

<p>Dave came to my husband with a <span class="locked">proposition——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There were only four people present?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Let me clarify the statement about Dave. He was a bartender
for the University Club on Commerce Street in Dallas. I became associated
with him and subsequently so did my husband. Well, at first it looked all
right to me. They wanted someone to pilot a boat—someone that knew Cuba,
and my husband claimed he did. Whether he did, I don’t know. I know he
did know boats. So they were going to bring Cuban refugees out into Miami.
All this was fine, because by that time everyone knew Castro for what he
appears to be, shall we say. So I said sure, why not—$10,000. I said that is
fine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do I understand from that that you and your husband were
to receive $10,000 for your services?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, I was incidental.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I would like to know.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I say I was incidental. My husband was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your husband was to receive $10,000?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who told him so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The colonel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did this meeting take place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. In Dallas at an apartment building. Again, I can describe that
darned building to a “T” and I couldn’t tell you what street it is on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you describe it for us, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; it was sitting—if I may do it in diagram.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what section of the city it was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; this I don’t. You come along—let’s say this is your main
street, that the apartment building set on. We have an apartment building,
not setting facing the street, but with the side towards the street. A hill slopes
up. There is a path that kind of winds around. There are flowers and gardens
here; and in them I believe there is a little fountain—and in them was lights—illuminating
the gardens; and you have to come up a little hill, and walk
around—I am not sure whether there was a gravel path or not, or whether it is
flagstone—and into the building here. And it was a double deck, I believe—perhaps
a triple.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Apartment house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many apartments, roughly speaking?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I could not say how many. The standard apartment building
for Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, at this point let us do this: You have handed us
the card that you referred to in your testimony previously. We have now
had a Xerox copy made of it. I am handing you back the original. For the
purpose of identification, I am marking the Xerox copy, front and back, as
follows, to wit: “Washington, D.C., June 2, 1964, Exhibit No. 3, Deposition of
Nancy Perrin Rich,” and I am signing my name below that. And on the reverse
side of it, which appears on another Xerox page, I am marking for the purpose
of identification the following: “Washington, D.C., June 2, 1964, Exhibit No.
3-A, Deposition of Nancy Perrin Rich,” under which I have signed my name.
And I ask you, please, to sign both documents below my name so that the
record will show that we have been speaking of the same document.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Note for the record that I signed Nancy E. Perrin Rich under
Mr. Hubert’s name on Exhibit No. 3. Will you note for the record that I signed
Nancy E. Perrin Rich under Mr. Hubert’s name on Exhibit No. 3-A.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Nancy Perrin Rich Exhibits Nos.
3 and 3-A for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, a moment ago you were testifying concerning an apartment
house at which you and your husband met a colonel and another man
by the name of Dave C., I think you said.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; that is an initial—C. Dave took us there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am going to mark that document for the purpose of identification
“Washington, D.C., June 2, 1964, Exhibit No. 4, Deposition of Nancy
Perrin Rich,” under which I am signing my name, and I ask you to sign your
name on it, if you please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I didn’t mean for this to be an exhibit. Will you note for the
record that I signed Nancy E. Perrin Rich under Mr. Hubert’s name on Exhibit
No. 4. Also note for the record the writing I am doing after signing is merely
designating what the lines mean.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Nancy Perrin Rich Exhibit No. 4 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Am I correct in stating that prior to the writing you have just
put on the document, Exhibit No. 4, there were merely lines which indicated a
street and an apartment and a little path, showing a garden. And that since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
the document has been identified, you have written in all that appears in
handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember on what floor this apartment was that you
visited?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I believe the first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember whether it was to the left or the right as
you went in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. There was no question of left or right as such. It was—you just
walked in. There was no hallway to indicate left or right, if that is what you
are referring to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, this apartment actually opened on the path?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many rooms did it have?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I don’t recall whether it was a one or two bedroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you give us any other description of the apartment building,
first of all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The apartment itself wasn’t too well furnished.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it a brick apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I believe it was. Either brick or stucco.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know the color of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I don’t. But I believe it had colored doors. Now, I could be
mistaken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the apartment itself was one or two bedrooms, and I think
you say it was not well furnished. Do you recall anything about the interior
of the apartment that would be significant?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Let me clarify that. When I say not well furnished, I should have
said sparsely furnished. It looked like an unfurnished apartment that he had
just thrown some furniture into and not too much of it. I believe I remember
he said something about he just moved in; hadn’t finished it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did it have lamps in it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I believe it did. I think it had one lamp on the table.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall anything about the furniture that was there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; it was, I believe you call it Danish modern.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it upholstered?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I don’t recall. It was typical cheap apartment furniture. I believe
it had plastic upholstery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you said you went there at night.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. It was after dark. Probably 9 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall how long it took you to drive from where you
were living to this place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you get there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. In Dave’s car. Now, again, I said four people present. I should
have counted—he had a girl with him. She wasn’t in it or anything, just some
girl he had along for the evening. She was never part of it. In fact, I think she
stayed in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long were you in the place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Oh, probably half an hour, 45 minutes, an hour at the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the general discussion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Feeling each other out. I just kind of sat there and listened.
The general gist of it was we were going to obtain a boat, the colonel could
obtain various things, and nothing specific was mentioned on what the various
things were at that time. And we were going to go and pick up—they were
deciding where to pick them up—pick up Cuban refugees, and bring them over
to the main coast, meaning Miami, which, quite frankly, I adhered to because
at that time, as I say, Castro is or was what we suppose him to be today,
and quite frankly I had seen underprivileged countries and at that time
thought it was a good idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was the sum of $10,000 mentioned at that meeting?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who mentioned it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The colonel. And it seemed awfully exorbitant for something
like this. I smelled a fish, to quote a maxim.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you thought that there was too much money involved
for this sort of operation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t express that view, of course?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; I didn’t say anything. I just kept quiet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How were matters left at the end of that meeting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That there were more people involved, and that we were to
attend a meeting at some later date, of which we would be advised.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you advised?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. We were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did another meeting take place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long after the first?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Oh, probably 5 or 6 days, give or take a day or 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. At the same place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it at night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. It was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you get there then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. We went in our own car, but with Dave with us. At that time,
Dave and my husband and I were in our car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Tell us what happened.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, we got there and at that time there was the colonel and
another middle-aged woman, kind of a real old granite face I would describe her,
steel-gray hair. Looked rather mannish. And there was a <span class="locked">rather——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know her name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; I was introduced. Names were mentioned around. I don’t
recall it. And then there was another rather pugnacious-looking fellow, who
looked at though he might have been an ex-prizefighter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you introduced to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I was introduced to everyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who else was there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The colonel, the woman, and the prizefighter type, a couple of
other men that just kind of sat off in the corner. One of them looked rather
dark, like he might have been Cuban or Latin American, and Dave, my husband,
and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what happened at that meeting.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, apparently from what I could discern, they had some kind of
a hitch in their plans. And at that time I point blank spoke up and said, “Well,
suppose we discuss the plans in full before we”—meaning my husband and myself—“get
into this. I would like to know what we are getting into. And at
this point you know by now I certainly have a say in this matter.” Then it came
out—boom—quite blank. We were going to bring Cuban refugees out—but we
were going to run military supplies and Enfield rifles in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who made that statement?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I believe it was the Latin-looking fellow that first made the statement.
But the colonel clarified it. The colonel seemed to be the head of it
and seemed to do all the talking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was in uniform?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you describe what the colonel looked like?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Vaguely. I would say approximately 45 to 50, perhaps a little
younger. He was kind of bald, and that may have made him look older. As
I recall, a rather slightly built man—and I would not swear to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have any other characteristics?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Not that I can recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he in summer uniform?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; he was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Short sleeves?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. If my memory serves me; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you whom he was representing in the matter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Not exactly. That fact never did come clear to me. A group of
people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, did he indicate in anyway that he was acting officially, in
his official capacity?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; he was not acting officially.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Because of certain statements that were made—statements such
as that the guns would have to come in via Mexico, meaning the Enfield rifles.
Statements like “We have been taking stuff off of the base for the last 3 months
getting prepared for this”—meaning military equipment, I suppose small arms,
or explosives, et cetera, as I understood it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was also in uniform on the first occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The same type of uniform?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say you never saw him out of uniform? All of the times
you saw him he was in uniform?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Summer uniform?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So at that meeting it came out that the project had two purposes.
One was to bring arms in, and the other was to take refuges out.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; to make money both ways. Then it became crystal clear why
so much money was to be paid for the pilot of the boat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how was that meeting left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, at that time when he said that, my first thought was “Nancy,
get out of here, this is no good, this stinks.” I have no qualms about making
money, but not when it is against the Federal Government but let’s play along
and see what happens. I said, “All right, we will go. But you can take the
$10,000 and keep it. I want $25,000 or we don’t move.” It was left that the
bigwigs would decide among themselves. During this meeting I had the shock
of my life. Apparently they were having some hitch in money arriving. No
one actually said that that was what it was. But this is what I presumed it to
be. I am sitting there. A knock comes on the door and who walks in but my
little friend Jack Ruby. And you could have knocked me over with a feather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was at the second meeting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what facts occurred to give you the impression that there
was a hitch with respect to money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Oh, just that they were talking about, well, first of all when I say
we—a group of people were supposed to go to Mexico to make the arrangement
for rifles but “Well, no, you can’t leave tomorrow”—they dropped it. And just
evasive statements that led me to believe that perhaps they were lacking in funds.</p>

<p>And then Ruby comes in, and everybody looks like this, you know, a big smile—like
here comes the Saviour, or something. And he took one look at me, I took
one look at him, and we glared, we never spoke a word. I don’t know if you
have ever met the man. But he has this nervous air about him. And he seemed
overly nervous that night. He bustled on in. The colonel rushed out into the
kitchen or bedroom, I am not sure which. Ruby had—and he always did carry
a gun—and I noticed a rather extensive bulge in his—about where his breast
pocket would be. But at that time I thought it was a shoulder holster, which
he was in the habit of carrying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was in the habit of carrying?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes. Either a shoulder holster or a gun stuck in his pocket. I
always had a gun behind the bar. That is normal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had seen it at his shoulder?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; which was normal—because he made the bank deposit. I
made the bank deposit a couple of times for him and carried a gun when I made it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he show any signs of recognition of you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; he glared at me and I glared back, as much as to say to each
other what the heck are you doing here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you told the colonel and Dave what your name was prior
to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. At that time we—I think it will be obvious to you gentlemen the
reason—we were going under Jack Starr and Nancy Starr.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you mean that is the name that Ruby knew you under?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No. Jack Ruby knew me as Nancy Perrin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he knew your husband was Robert Perrin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes. But like I say for obvious reasons we used the name Jack
and Nancy Starr.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say, you told the colonel and Dave that your <span class="locked">name——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; Dave knew our real name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The <span class="locked">colonel——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The colonel and everyone else involved, with the exception of Ruby
and Dave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They knew you as Nancy Starr?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes. Also let me state that my husbands’ nom de plume as a writer
was Jack Starr. I have also published under Nancy Starr.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. What happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, they went in and came out and the bulge was gone, and everybody
was really happy, and all of a sudden they seemed to be happy. So it was
my impression Ruby brought money in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They walked out of the apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Ruby left. He didn’t stay. He wasn’t there for more than 15
minutes at the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say all of a sudden the bulge was gone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The bulge was gone from Ruby when he left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he leave the room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. He left the apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean from the time he came in until he left.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. He came in. To everyone else except my husband and I he said,
“Hi.” He and the colonel rushed into—I forget whether it was the kitchen or
the bedroom. They were in there about 10 minutes. I heard some rather loud
undistinguishable words. They closed the door. When they came out everybody
looked relieved. And Ruby just walked out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And said nothing to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You say the money was forthcoming?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you get it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; we didn’t. First they had to pay for this pugnacious-looking
fellow and one of the Latins who were going down to Mexico to make arrangements
and pay for the guns. All of a sudden just before Ruby come in they
couldn’t go, and right after Ruby left they were on the plane the next morning,
so to speak.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not see Jack Ruby hand any money to anybody?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nor did you see any money handed to anyone else.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So the way it was left then, these people, the others, were going
to go to <span class="locked">Mexico——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Actually they were going to leave not the day following, but the day
after that—2 days later they were going to leave for Mexico. I just assumed that
that was money that Ruby brought in. Because before that they could not go,
they did not have the finances, and after he left they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they say they did not have the finances, or was it your assumption
that they did not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. When someone is stalling around, and not setting a concrete date
and saying, “Well, we have to wait” and that it will get here soon, and statements
like that that I hear in conversation, then all of a sudden in comes a man
with a bulge and hands it to the colonel in the back room, so to speak, and all of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
a sudden, boom, the reservations are made then and there, I think that is a pretty
good assumption.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, those are the facts that you observed upon which
you base the assumptions that you have made.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct. And the big sigh of relief, so to speak, afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, did you then ask about your portion of the money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. At that time it was to be decided, as I say, among the bigwigs. I
had asked for $25,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that before Ruby came in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; in fact it was just a few minutes before he knocked on the
door. They decided they did not know, and they were going to have a meeting—there
were some other people involved higher up than they were. They would
have to talk it over with them. At that time I had it in my mind I would go
ahead and play ball—and I was stalling when I asked for the $25,000—that I
would notify the Federal authorities. As I say, bringing the refugees out is one
thing. Running in guns is another thing, for a Communist country which at that
time it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did that meeting last?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. They were still going when we left. And we were there about
2½ hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you and your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Dave remained behind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. He remained. Well, actually at that point business was over, and
it just became a party. Neither my husband nor I drink, so we left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you leave it with them? Who was going to make the
next move?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. We were to be notified as to the time and place of the next meeting
and as to the decision on upping the ante, so to speak.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They did not reject your offer of $25,000?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. It was to be discussed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. $10,000 was all right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; $10,000 was offered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. $25,000, which was your counter offer, had to be discussed.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And they told you they would discuss that and let you know.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. With some other people that were higher up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They told you they were higher up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; the colonel said that they were higher up. I do not know
the exact words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I think his exact words were something like “I will discuss it with
my bosses.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened after that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, about 3 or 4 days later we were told there was going to be
another meeting to attend. Dave came over and told us. And we went. <span class="locked">And——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened at that meeting? First of all, who was there?
How did you go?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. My husband and I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You went in your car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of a car did you have?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. At that time I believe we had a 1956 blue and white Ford, if I
am not mistaken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What license plate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Under the name of Perrin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. So you went with your husband. This was the third
visit. Same place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Same place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Same apartment?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No change in the furniture or decorations or anything of that
sort?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Not that I recall. I did not really notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And this third meeting was about 4 or 5 days after the first?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Three or four; after the second.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How were you notified to come to the first meeting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. To come to the first meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; the third.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Dave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, Dave was the man who was in between, as
it were.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, Dave was in it. It was only because he was our friend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he to get anything out of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I don’t know; never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Didn’t you discuss that with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. In that sort of business, you don’t discuss things, apparently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you did.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, not to that point. It wouldn’t have done me any good. I
would have just gotten a “none of your business” answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t know that to be a fact, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, call it intuition. I don’t know. I just wouldn’t have
gotten an answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you think that Dave expected some money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I suppose so. I never did get his position quite clear in my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was the one that had brought you into the picture in the
first place.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes. It seemed to me like a front man for them, or something,
or a recruiter almost.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you were concerned about the question of money involved
in this thing, because as you said you let them know that you would have a
say about this.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you did not discuss with Dave whether he was to be paid
by you or the other side, as it were.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Oh, no; he wasn’t to be paid by us. He brought us into the
group, so to speak. The only thing I could make him out to be is a recruiter.
Not to be paid by us. Nothing was ever mentioned of Dave going on any
of these trips.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But he was not to get a fee for finding you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I don’t know. I really don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you did not raise the point with him.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nor did your husband, to your knowledge.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I don’t know. I didn’t ask him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did it concern you that Dave might want some of the money
that you were going to get?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Not particularly, because at that time I had already made up
my mind to go to the authorities with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had made up your mind when?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. After the second meeting, I found out they were going to run
rifles in, and military supplies and things that apparently—again apparently
were being pilfered from a base somewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You made up your mind at the end really of the second meeting.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; and then they said to run rifles and stolen military supplies
in—that was it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell your husband so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you tell Dave so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I did not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go to the authorities?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I never had the chance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, we went back to that third meeting and apparently by
mutual consent we got out of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what happened at the third meeting, including who was
there.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, who was there—there was the colonel, again this pugnacious-looking
fellow who supposedly had gone to Mexico and been back; the
Latin-looking fellow and the other one with him who might have been Latin
wasn’t there—this woman was there. And another man I had not seen before,
but whose face rang a bell. And I could not put a name to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever been able to do so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Again, unless I am awfully mistaken, and I have yet to be able
to find a picture of this man, but I recall seeing a picture and I know why
I had associated him—of his father.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whose father?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. This particular man. Now, again, what I am about to say is
not fact. It is something that I have never quite been able to get clear in
my mind and never will, until I can find a picture. Unless I am very mistaken,
the man at that third meeting was Vito Genovese’s son.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was not introduced as such?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. He was introduced as Tony. That was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know Vito Genovese?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; I never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you knew his picture.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I had seen his picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You thought there was a resemblance between that picture and
this man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes. For a week this bothered me. And all of a sudden it came
crystal clear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What became clear?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That unless I was way off base, that is who it was. And I do
know that a lot of <span class="locked">people——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was a week after the third meeting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes. I had been trying to put a name to that face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now, what else happened at the third meeting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, No. 1, the raise of ante was turned down. The colonel
asked us if we would accept $15,000. My husband started to say something.
I hushed him up and said “No.” I said, “I don’t know. I want some time to
think about it.” So then the phone rang, and quite a lengthy conversation
took place in the other room. I could not swear to who was on the other
end of the phone, I have a pretty good idea. And the colonel came back out
and said, “I don’t know. We are going to call this off for a while anyway.
There has just been a change of plans. We are going to have to postpone this
for 3 or 4 months. There will be one more meeting.” And at that time I stood
up and I said, “Look, quite frankly I don’t believe we want any part of this
at all.” All I wanted to do then and there was to get the devil out of there.
I quite frankly was scared. So I grabbed my old man and we cleared out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But before clearing out, you told them you wanted no part of it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; that was after the colonel had said there was going to be a 3- or
4-month delay and change of plans, and all this, that and the other. I did not
quite figure that maybe things were kosher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did they accept your suggestion that you would bail out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I don’t know. We left. I wasn’t going to wait around to find out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you never did report it to the authorities.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; I never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, my husband got picked up in Dallas, and I will never know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
if this was true—he said it wasn’t—the policeman said it was. My husband
had a .45. It was not registered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean a pistol?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; a service automatic. He had no right carrying it. He had
it in the car. At that time he had a little old Nash Rambler station wagon of
his own. This cop says when he picked my husband up my husband was standing
in a little clearing beside the road there on the way out to Rayburn, brandishing
a gun around saying he was going to kill somebody. He come to find out
if it was a cop he was going to kill. I will never know to this day whether
this was true or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long after the third meeting did this happen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That happened between the second and third meeting, if my time
elements are right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was your husband arrested?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; he was. That is when this Sy Victorson I mentioned earlier
in my testimony came in. He was an attorney. Perhaps not too honest in some
of the things he does, but a good attorney. And he got my husband out of it.
I had to pay some money. I will never know to this day whether it was true.
I can’t believe it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that event took place between the second and third meeting,
is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long after the third meeting did you leave Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Oh, possibly 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what was the reason for leaving Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The minute I put a name to that face I said to Bob, “We are getting
out of here, and we are getting out fast, right now.” That was about 5 o’clock
at night. At 8 o’clock we was packed in a U-Haul trailer and out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you did not put the name to the face at the third meeting.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; not until about a week later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You then drove to New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes. But by then everything had fallen into place, because Ruby
had had various characters visit him, both from New York, Chicago, even from
up in Minneapolis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I was introduced to some of them. I was asked to go out with
some of them.</p>

<p>(At this point, a short recess was taken.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I think we left off at the place where you were saying that
subsequent to the third meeting Ruby was visited by certain people whose names
I do not think you mentioned.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; this was prior. This is while I worked for Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I saw them come and go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see Ruby any more after the third meeting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I did not. I did not see him in fact at the third meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean after the second.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Oh, perhaps on the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not converse with him about this matter at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I did not. I wanted no truck with the man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your reason for leaving Dallas, you say, was <span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I smelled an element that I did not want to have any part of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that element was what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Police characters, let’s say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, specifically it was, as I understood your testimony, that you
suddenly identified the man who was at the third meeting, but not at any other,
as possibly being the son of Vito Genovese.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Possibly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that you made that recognition, or you associated that man
whom you saw with Vito Genovese, solely because you had seen a picture of
Vito Genovese.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you came to the conclusion, then, that Vito Genovese and
that group of people were involved in this matter.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Within my own mind; yes. I thought—then I got thinking perhaps
the higher-up that the colonel spoke of was perhaps the element I did not
want to deal with that was running the guns in, and God knows what else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why didn’t you report it to the authorities in the interval between
the third meeting and the time you left Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. For the simple reason that I was hesitant about mentioning anything
about my husband’s past. I did not know how much of what my husband
had told me was true. I did not know how much of that he knew before I knew it,
or how deeply he was involved in anything. And quite frankly if my husband
was still alive, I would never have gone to the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you already told us at the end of the second meeting you
had decided to tell the authorities.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Not when I see that element there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But that element does not <span class="locked">affect——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That element, if what my husband had told me was true, could
have involved him a lot deeper than I suspected. And quite frankly I am not
stupid enough, shall we say, to believe if I ever went to the authorities and that
element was involved that I would ever live to tell a second story. And if my
suppositions were true as to who the man’s identity really is—a combination of
fear for myself and protecting my husband. And at that time I thought, I
suppose many citizens do, well, let the next fellow do it, they will catch them
eventually. I chose to close my eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You still have the fear of that element?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why is that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, since then I have become involved more extensively or
intensively in police work—and I don’t know—perhaps I have got some sense
in my head. I am just not. I was told to tell you this—by the way, I had
better bring it in now—I don’t know if it has any direct result on this or not—but
I was advised by Mr. Sweeny from the Secret Service and Mr. Fahety from
the FBI to tell you of this. A <span class="locked">week——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did Mr. Sweeny and Mr. Fahety tell you what you are
about to tell us?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Fahety said it on Monday—Sweeny said it on Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Last Monday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yesterday. And Fahety told me Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. On the phone, when I talked to the FBI and the Secret Service,
respectively.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They called you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did they tell you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, the FBI had called me to advise me of my receiving this
letter, because Kennett had called them. And Sweeny called me to advise me
of my tickets and transportation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who called the FBI?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Rod Kennett had opened the letter from you people. And at
this <span class="locked">time——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what they advised you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. They advised me to tell you what I am about to tell you. A week
ago last Saturday night I got home about 10:30, my brother-in-law had a
<span class="locked">stroke——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s get the date of that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That would be a week ago last Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Last Saturday was the 30th—the 23d of May.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. About 10:30 at night I got home. And some phone calls started.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
Again, let me say this may not or it may have a bearing on this. My life was
directly threatened. I called the Hanover police—something I very seldom
will do. But I panicked. They also phoned my husband’s office. He was working
that night on dispatch at the cab company. They threatened my life with
him. Sometimes they would call and say something, sometimes just hang up,
sometimes just giggle. But they directly threatened my life. I thought perhaps
it was something to do with various police organization work I had done,
somebody had a grudge or something, or a crank, or anything. The phone calls
stopped and they started again. I called the police department again. But then
I was in hysterics.</p>

<p>Last Thursday I was on my way from my home up to North Attleboro, Mass.
For approximately 30 miles I was followed, and subsequently, up until last
Sunday I have had a tail on me. I notified the Mansfield police. They got the
registration number and the name of the fellow following me. And he could
give no reason why he was almost 60 or 70 miles from where he lived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the Mansfield police have a record of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct. Mansfield, Mass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you also reported it to the police <span class="locked">of——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Hanover—the phone calls; yes. May I also add at this time that
due to a personal contact of mine, I will be doing, not for pay but as a favor,
a little bit of looking into a few matters for the Mansfield Police Department for
Chief D’Alefie, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He recently contacted you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, the day I was up there we got talking and come to find out
I could probably help him—in fact, me being here today stopped me from
actually doing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the day you saw him was last Thursday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was at that time he said he might be able to use your
services?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; most definitely. And then again, come Friday, and I get
notification of this, I was just wondering whether or not it added in. It may
and it may not. But I was told to tell you. And I have done so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, what happened on Friday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No. I received notification, your letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see what you mean.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. And I wondered if it did not somehow have a bearing on this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But this tailing was after you got the letter, and after you had
spoken <span class="locked">to——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; it started the day before. It was the same week. Thursday
I started to be tailed. Rod got the letter Thursday, called the FBI, and God
knows how many people he told. Thursday afternoon I picked up a tail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you reported that to the Mansfield police.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That was the first time I saw a policeman that I could pull over
and say, “Get the guy, he is tailing me.” And he most definitely was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But there were two occasions when you observed that you were
being tailed.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; from last Thursday up until Sunday night I had a tail on
me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you reported to the chief of police in Mansfield on Thursday
that you had a tail on you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The Mansfield police is the one that caught the guy that was
tailing me Thursday. I have not had a chance to <span class="locked">report——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was a different person, then, you think.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The person that has been tailing me Friday, Saturday, and Sunday
is not the same person that has been tailing me Thursday. They caught
the guy Thursday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What sort of an automobile was it that was tailing you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Thursday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No. Well, Thursday first.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Thursday was a black Pontiac, Massachusetts registration, a Mr.
Alberto, from Hyde Park. They got him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is his name, Alberto?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is his first name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I have forgotten.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the other car that has been tailing you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Plural.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. More than one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. More than one individual, or more than one car, or both?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Both. Friday and Saturday it was a green, I would say, probably
1961, 1962 Chevrolet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Green?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it the same man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; it was not. It was an older man. The fellow following me
was probably maybe 21, 23 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is the first fellow.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Friday and Saturday it was the same man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Middle aged; I didn’t get a real good look at him—I would say
probably in his forties. He rather looked to be a husky-looking fellow. And
Sunday I picked up a tail, and it was a man and a woman. And I thought I
recognized the girl, and I cannot be sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Same automobile?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; it was not the same vehicle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about that automobile.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The vehicle that was on me Sunday was a blue two-door hardtop.
And I do not know the make of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you have not reported those last incidents?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, they tailed you from where to where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Wherever I went. I would leave the house, and believe me I
think I know when I am being tailed. When I pull over to the side of the road,
and a car pulls up and doesn’t pass me—I will do this two or three times. And
when I take a turnoff where nobody else will take, and the car is still there, I
think they are tailing me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You tried to shake them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Precisely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were not able to do so.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you get to your house, did they park around it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The one time the man did, down on the bridge—the boundary
line to our property is a river. And he sat down there and pretended to be
looking in the water. And then I would see him down by Jordan’s, which is an
eating house. Then he would be cruising around. And finally he would give
up and go away. And in a couple of hours he would be back. Every time I
took the car out, they were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about at night? Did you observe anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I didn’t go out at night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Therefore you did not observe anything.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; I didn’t bother. Saturday I went to Maine—took my
daughter down to my mother’s. I had the green car on my tail all the way to
Maine and back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you get to Washington to come to this deposition?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. By plane; American Airlines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you notice anything about being tailed in that regard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I didn’t notice. I don’t think I was. I left my house in my own
car and drove to North Quincy, where I was subsequently picked up by Mr.
Milton of the Secret Service and taken directly to the airport, and he stayed
with me until I left. I was subsequently met here by Bill something-or-other
of the Secret Service. Now, as I say, this may or may not—quite frankly, I
don’t think it does have any bearing on this. But I think it is something entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
different. I think it has to do with the names of some bookmakers and a
couple of abortionists I turned in to the district attorney in Boston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you mentioned to me earlier that this card which has been
identified as Exhibit No. 3 is a card that is usually issued—am I not right—that
it is a card usually issued under the requirements of California law to a person
who has got a record; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; that is not correct. No. 1, the card is obsolete. That is why
it was back-dated. It was merely a pawnshop identification card.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you mentioned that it would establish your status in
someway for, I think you used the word, obvious purposes. What would this
card do in connection with the work that you were supposed to do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, the card in itself, nothing. It would prove I was there when
I said I was, because I had to attend associations with certain people, who at
that time were safely tucked away, but at the time I was supposedly supposed
to be there they were not—I was supposedly supposed to have worked for these
people. If I recall correctly I said that I have a police record under that same
name of Julie Anne Cody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that name—that police record—is a fictitious record in the
sense that the offenses listed under the name of Julie Anne Cody really did not
ever occur.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have any record under your right name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes, I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is in Brookline, Mass., and it is a record for prostitution.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that fictitious?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that the only record you have?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That’s correct—that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I assume that you would know all the records you have.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, when I say that, I was picked up twice in Dallas and both
times the charges were dropped—as far as I know. That is what Sy Victorson
told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you ever charged?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you ever booked?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you were arrested.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes. One time I was in jail for a couple of hours, the other time
5 hours, because they could not get hold of Sy, who was on the golf course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you told why you were being arrested?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I was arrested for investigation of vag, <span class="locked">narcotics——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Vag—vagrancy. Narcotics, prostitution, and anything else they
could dream up. This is very shortly after I had threatened to go and bring
suit against Mr. Ruby. I was told I might find the climate outside of Dallas a
little more to my liking if I didn’t take the advice of the police department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who told you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The time I went down and wanted to bring charges against Ruby
for assault and battery, I was told not to, and at that time I was also advised—I
was not told to leave the city or anything like that, but that it was nice in
Chicago, for instance, that time of year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I think you said that you did not remember the name of the
man.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I cannot remember the name of the detective that I spoke to; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But he was the detective on the police force?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. He was. Jack Ruby is very well known in Dallas. A little too
well known.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Just a personal opinion. I believe—now, this is not a fact, this is
just talk, this is just personal opinion—I believe at the time of the—am I naming
it correctly—Oswald assassination, it was claimed that Ruby got in there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
pretending to be a reporter. Am I correct that that was in the printed page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, what comment have you got to make to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Anyone that made that statement would be either a damn liar
or a damn fool.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. There is no possible way that Jack Ruby could walk in Dallas and
be mistaken for a newspaper reporter, especially in the police department. Not
by any stretch of the imagination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that your opinion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is not my personal opinion. That is a fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, on what do you base it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Ye gods, I don’t think there is a cop in Dallas that doesn’t know
Jack Ruby. He practically lived at that station. They lived in his place. Even
the lowest patrolman on the beat. He is a real fanatic on that, anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say even the lowest patrolman on the beat, what do
you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Everybody from the patrolmen on the beat in uniform to, I guess
everybody with the exception of Captain Fritz, used to come in there, knew him
personally. He used to practically live at the station. I am not saying that
Captain Fritz didn’t know him. I am saying he was never—I have never seen
him in the Carousel. He has always been, I think, a little too far above things
for that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you have seen other high-ranking officers there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you name them, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I would if I could. I would be only too glad to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you don’t know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I cannot recall names, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you know they were high-ranking officers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. At that time I knew them. Two years from now, if somebody
asked me your name, I would remember I knew you, I had seen you, but I could
not tell him your name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You remember Captain Fritz’ name.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Everybody remembers Captain Fritz. Will Fritz is quite a famous
man. And I would say he is of the highest integrity. Probably the only one
I know of on the police department that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you mentioned in one interview you had with the FBI
that you had some information that a contact in regard to this gunrunning
business was to be made at the Hotel Nueva Gallina in the city of Guadalajara,
Mexico. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. To the best of my knowledge; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you get the information from?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. In the conversation at the second or third meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you mention that to the FBI people in any of your interviews
prior to January?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Not that I recall. I never talked about it prior to the time
I went there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You spoke to the FBI in November and again in December.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Let’s put it this way. When you say prior to me going to the FBI—I
went to the FBI the first time I believe in Oakland. And I do not recall
whether or not I told them the first time or the second time about that. Whichever
time I told them, I don’t recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think it is a fact, is it not, that you contacted the FBI in
Brookline, Mass., sometime in January to tell them that you had been going
through some things of yours and had additional information.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I believe it was in January. It was in Boston, by the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was in Boston?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes. I believe it was Mr. Stoddard I talked to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the additional information?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Right now I do not even remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall that you found something among your things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
which indicated that the contact during the gunrunning proposition was supposed
to be at this hotel in Guadalajara?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I don’t remember what it was I turned up. I think it was then—I
know I turned up an address book with a telephone number in it. I forgot
whether that was here or in Oakland. And some cards. I know what it was.
It was on the back of a business card. That’s right. It was on the back of a
business card I turned that up. Yes; it was when I called them—because I had
gone through my strongbox after my stuff had got here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But the information that you had gotten concerning the contact
point as being in this hotel in Guadalajara, that information was obtained by
you at one of the meetings that you have just described.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. It was obtained there; yes. And if I remember, it had eluded me
when I first talked to them. And if I am not mistaken—I should have brought
it—I have it on the back of a business card at home, that I turned up among
some of my old business cards from Dallas in an envelope. Now, whether or not
I had recalled that and told them at the first meeting or whether it was part of
the additional information I don’t remember. But it seems to me I turned that
business card up and did not remember that at the first talking with the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Whose name was on the front of the business card?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Some advertising agency. It was just some card I marked it
down on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you in the advertising business in 1961?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. In Boston. I handled the National Automatic Merchandising
Association NAMA Week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What part of 1961?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The first week in April we had the Governor proclaim it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who said that the contact was going to be at this hotel in
Guadalajara?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I don’t know which one said it, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember at what meeting this was said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I believe at the third—the second. I wouldn’t swear, but I think
the third.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was definitely not the first.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; definitely not the first. Either the second or the third.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was at the second that you had raised your price, I think, to
$25,000.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was either that meeting or the third meeting that you got
the information about the contact point being in this hotel.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I am not sure which one it was, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You indicated that you did not know where this house was
located in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I couldn’t give you a street; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you give us a general area of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I am sorry, sir, I wish I could. I would recognize the house if
I saw it. I cannot explain the human mind to you. Why is it that sometimes
if you don’t want to remember something, you can block things off? It was
something distasteful to me. I have perhaps not been a model person <span class="locked">but——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you heard from this man Dave since you left Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does the name Dave Cherry mean anything to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That’s it. I have been wracking my brain for that name. A swell-looking
fellow—crewcut, young, real college-looking type.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long had you known him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. A couple of months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you meet him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. University Club. I believe I met him there. Just precisely where
I met him I don’t know. I think the University Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that prior to the time your husband came to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I don’t remember if I met him before or after, to be truthful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, he was the man who made the contact.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Again, as I told the FBI, I will swear about 99 percent of it that
he was the one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you went there—he was present at three meetings.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you knew him for 2 months prior to that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct—about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why should there be any doubt in your mind whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Because somewhere another face keeps popping up. And don’t
ask me to go into it, because I could not if I tried.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you think it might not be Dave Cherry?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; that it is. I am about 1 percent unsure. And I told the FBI
that. But that is the only face I can put with that. And I keep putting Dave
in that car and over there with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you advise your husband about being tailed recently?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; my husband is aware of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. <span class="locked">Now——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. As I say, I don’t believe this has anything to do with this at all.
I told you merely because I was told to. Otherwise I would never point it out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Perhaps we ought to get for the record what the names of these
Secret Service and FBI agents are. I think you mentioned their last names.
Do you know their first names?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; I do not, sir. I would not know them if I saw them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They just spoke to you on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you know they were FBI agents?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The first time when Mr. Fahety called me I was not sure, and I
would not answer any questions. So he said, “Call me back collect” and I called
the FBI back collect and it was true enough. Mr. Sweeny I know it was, because
he said he bought the tickets and had information only the Secret Service
would know, and that Mr. Milton would pick me up subsequently, which he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You mentioned, I think, Mrs. Rich, that you were going to use
a boat to transport the guns to Cuba and the people back.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was this boat located?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. From what I understood; in Miami.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of a boat was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I don’t know. I was under the impression it might
have been an old picket boat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What gave you that impression?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Just the talk about it. I kind of got the impression that it might
have been one that had been—you know how the Coast Guard and the Navy
would sell them off sometime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had Dave Cherry been a friend of your husband’s?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; I don’t believe so. I do not know who his friends were when
he was in Dallas. Eddie Brawner and Youngblood were. Eddie Brawner could
probably tell you more on this than I could; because my husband talked to him
and wanted to go on the boat with him. He and Eddie used to race stock cars and
stuff. And he told me—my husband claimed he used to work for Herb Noble in
Dallas. There is something else. And Al Meadows. Al Meadows claimed he
never saw him. He is another underworld character—back there in prohibition.
And they used to run an Oklahoma gin. My husband claimed he was the only one
alive who knew who gunned Herb Noble down, and that he never told. And I
don’t know if it is true. Eddie Brawner was supposed to be in on this with him.
I think he told Eddie all about this, more than I knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How soon after your husband came to Dallas did Dave Cherry
meet him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I could not really say, actually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, what was the nature of his friendship for Dave Cherry?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. How did he meet him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No. To what extent were they friendly?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I don’t know. They would go off some time and I would not even
be there. Actually a lot of the stuff that transpired I could not tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this before or after the meeting with the colonel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. He know Dave before the meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how had he met him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Through me. And then again I am not clear whether I met him—this
is another point I am not clear on. I am not clear whether Bob met Dave
and introduced him to me or I introduced Dave to Bob. Here again I am not
clear. This may sound ridiculous, but I am not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was your husband’s experience with boats?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Again, factually I cannot tell you. Supposedly he had been in gun
running before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is the only experience you know of that he had with boats?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. He claimed he owned a big boat, he and Lee Dell owned a big boat
out in California. I guess he did because he had pictures of it and him working
around it. I still have the pictures. Now, Lee Dell, there is another man could
probably shed some light on this. But God knows where he is. I never met
the man. You see, I don’t know just exactly what I was involved in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you don’t know what your role was to be in this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Oh, you mean in this gun-running stuff to Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Just by sheer force of will and apparently because they wanted my
husband, I was going to go along.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You were going to go along as a passenger?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I was going to help working the boat, because I had knowledge of
boats.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What knowledge did you have of the boats?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I was born and brought up in Biddeford, Maine. I have worked
on lobster boats a good many years off and on. My uncle owns them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall any occasion on which you went to the University
Club and had some drinks and didn’t pay for them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I don’t think I ever paid for drinks at the University Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Dave never took money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go alone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I don’t remember. I believe so. Maybe, maybe not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But they would not take your money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Dave never charged me. He always told me it was all right.
And I don’t drink anyway. All I drink is coke. Once in a great, great while
I will drink either a grasshopper or like last night I was all keyed up so I had
a brandy Alexander before I went to bed. But I might have done this five times
in 10 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember an argument you had with your former and
deceased husband, Robert Perrin, in the University Club, which argument was
witnessed by Dave Cherry?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I never had an argument with my husband in the University Club
or anywhere else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the manager of the University Club telling you
that neither you nor your husband could return to the club thereafter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever telephone Cherry advising him that you were leaving
for New Orleans and that you expected to work for the Playboy Club there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I believe I did. I might have, because that is what my plans happened
to have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you in fact work for the Playboy Club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. For how long?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. 2 or 3 nights.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I didn’t like it. For one thing, you were not allowed to keep tips.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you live in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Part of the time down in one of the Sisters’ places, down in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
French Quarter, on St. Philip’s Street. And then 1713 Calhoun. That is where
my husband died. And various other places which I cannot remember, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did your husband do for a living while you were in New
Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. The last time he had the best position I have ever seen him hold.
He was working for a construction company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Oh, dear. Dickie Bennett, Mr. McHane, those were two of his
bosses—Mr. White.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What construction was he working on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Well, he was a mechanic for the heavy equipment. He was just
getting a raise and everything when this happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know the location where he was working?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes, out in Jeff Parish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was the building going up there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No, they had this contract for the phone company. They would
lay all their roads, and the poles and stuff, and various things. He would go
out on jobs. I got him the job through Dickie Bennett.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not work at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. <span class="locked">I——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I mean the time you were in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I would rather not answer that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. <span class="locked">This——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I will answer to this extent. For one thing, I dealt black jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mrs. Rich, you mentioned the name of a man by the name of
Brawner. Now, did Mr. Brawner ever attend any of these meetings with the
colonel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So his only knowledge of this would be what your husband might
have told him.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What does Mr. Brawner do for a living?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I don’t know what Eddie does—odd jobs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How old a man is he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Middle age—40, maybe. Does a lot of work with kids in these
go carts—soap box derbies and stuff. I guess they used to be in the carnival
together. As I say, everything I say, I don’t know how much truth there is in it
from what my husband told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where does Mr. Brawner live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Grand Prairie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know where in Grand Prairie?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is he married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Does he have a family?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; he does. I believe his wife’s name is Mary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many children does he have?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I don’t remember—quite a few—three or four.</p>

<p>I would like one thing known. Until the time I met my husband and since
he died I have done nothing that I would be ashamed of, nothing I would not
do in public. Now that I am married to Mr. Rich I do not want any recriminations
due to the fact of the period of time I was married to my husband. My
husband—the first year and a half of our marriage was beautiful. Then my
husband turned me out. Don’t ask me why I didn’t leave him. Everyone else
asked me that. It is not easy being something that is against everything that
you believe in or stand for 2 years. There were periods—I told the FBI this,
and I might as well state it right here. I was a prostitute—call it what you
may—call girl, madam. It still boils down to the same damn thing. When I
worked, he worked. When I quit, he quit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are talking about Robert Perrin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I am talking about Robert Perrin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did you marry Mr. Perrin?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. July of—August of 1960, I believe—1961. I have forgotten.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Prior to that time you had never been in any trouble with the
police?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. No; except when I was 16, I was driving a car with no license
and had been taking some medicine and I hit a pole with it, and lied to my
uncle, who was the judge, and he made me pay a fine. He made me spend overnight
in our own little jail in our own little town to teach me a lesson, and it
did. He said if I had not lied, it would have been all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the significance of your remark that when you worked
he worked, and when you did not <span class="locked">work——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. As long as I was hustling he would work, and as long as I wasn’t
hustling he would not work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does that mean he <span class="locked">was——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. My husband turned me out. That is what it means.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Turned you out of the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. This is an expression used in that particular trade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What you mean <span class="locked">is——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. He taught me how to be a prostitute, obtained dates for me, et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera. I married into a very respectable family. I come
from a respectable family. And I came here today all set on any question such
as this to take the fifth amendment, or just refuse to answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, ma’am, let the record show that a moment ago, when
you said you would rather not go into this, you were not pressed into
going into it, but you said you wished to do so, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is not correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the situation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Why did I do it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; why did you tell us about this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. I am sorry. Change my statement from that is not correct to
that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say a moment ago—let me get this clear—when you
said that is a matter you did not want to go into, you will agree with me, will
you not, that I did not pursue the matter, but that you then said “I might as well
tell you” and proceeded to do so.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct. Why did I do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No, ma’am; I am not asking you why.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. All right, that’s fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think we do have the date of your husband’s death.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. August 29, 1962, city of New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you say there was an autopsy made?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. Yes; there was. He had been dead 2 days before I knew it. I
wasn’t there. I think all I felt was a great sense of relief.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Mrs. Rich, is it not a fact that there has been no off-the-record
conversation between us at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it not a fact that all that has occurred between you and me
in this interview, with Mr. Griffin, is all on the record?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rich</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Thank you, Mrs. Rich.</p>

<h2 id="EARL_RUBY">TESTIMONY OF EARL RUBY</h2>
</div>

<p>The testimony of Earl Ruby was taken at 9 a.m., on June 3, 1964, at 200
Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C., by Messrs. Burt W. Griffin and Leon D.
Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Earl Ruby.</p>

<p>My name is Leon D. Hubert. I am a member of the Advisory Staff of the
General Counsel of the President’s Commission on the Assassination of President
Kennedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
Under the provisions of the Presidential Executive Order 11130, dated November
29, 1963, the joint resolution of Congress No. 137, and the rules of procedure
adopted by the President’s Commission, in conformance with that Executive
order and that joint resolution, I have been authorized by the Commission to
take a sworn deposition from you.</p>

<p>I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission’s inquiry is to
ascertain, evaluate and report upon the facts relative to the assassination of
President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>In particular as to you, Mr. Ruby, the nature of the inquiry today is to determine
what facts you know about the death of Oswald, and about any possible
relationship of Jack Ruby with that death, and any other pertinent facts you
may know about the general inquiry.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Ruby, I think you appear here today by virtue of a letter addressed
to you by Mr. J. Lee Rankin, General Counsel for the staff of the President’s
Commission. Is that a fact, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; that is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was that received?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I received that Monday when I returned home from work about
7 p.m., it was waiting for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was June 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the date of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That it was mailed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It was mailed May 28.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t think there is any problem about it, but just to make
certain, under the rules adopted by the Commission you are entitled to a 3-day
written notice prior to the taking of this deposition, but the rules also provide
that a witness may waive the 3-day notice if he wishes. I think that there has
actually been a 3-day notice under the rules of the Commission since the 3 days
commence to run from the time of the mailing of the document, but in this case,
as I said, the rules provide that you can waive the 3-day written notice, and I
will ask you now if you are willing to waive it and go on with your testimony
today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I am willing to waive the 3-day notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you stand, then, and raise your right hand, so I may
administer the oath.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give in this matter
will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you state your full name, please, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Earl R. Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old are you, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Forty-nine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who are you married to? What was the maiden name of the
lady you married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Margie Greene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And have you been married only once?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I was married twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the name of your first wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Mildred Brownstein.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you marry her, and where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I married her in Chicago in 1945.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how was that marriage dissolved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Through divorce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was the divorce obtained?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have been married, then, twice only?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And do you have any children?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any from the first marriage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. For the record, would you state the names of the children and
their ages?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Robert, 15 years of age; Denise, 13 years of age; and Joyce, 10
years of age.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you presently reside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. 29925 Woodland Drive, Southfield, Mich.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is Southfield near Detroit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; it is a suburb, northwest suburb of Detroit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Ruby, I wish to get some general background concerning you,
starting off with where you were born and where you spent the early years of
your life. Will you tell us, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir. I was born in Chicago on April 16, 1915, and I lived on
what is known as the east side of Chicago, and went to school in that area for
a few years, and then my mother and father became separated, and I was sent
to a foster home, and then I also was sent to live on a farm for a year, a little
more than a year. Then I came back and lived in another foster home for
awhile. Then we sort of, the family sort of, got together and I moved back with
my mother and the rest of the family other than my father, and then we more
or less lived together until I enlisted in the Service in 1942, and then my mother
passed away in 1944, and then I became married in 1945. Is that skipping
too much, do you think?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I would like to go back a bit and get some dates on some of
the things you have said there. For example, when did your father and mother
separate so that home was broken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know. I don’t remember, it is so far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old were you, roughly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t even know, 8, 7, 8, 9. I don’t even remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you think it would have been around the early
1920’s, 1922, 1923, 1924, somewhere along in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes. I don’t remember those dates at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What were the foster homes? Were they sort of orphanages?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or homes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Private homes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Private homes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Private homes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you separated from your brothers and sisters when you
went to the foster home, or did they go to the same foster home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. On the farm I was with my brother Sam, and Jack was in another
farm some distance away from us. In the foster home Sam and I were together
again, I think, just Sam and I. Then in another foster home, I think Jack was
with us. The three of us were in one foster home together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you said that you lived at what was called the east side
in Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; it was like the ghetto of Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I wanted to get what sort of a neighborhood is that? What
sort of a district was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It was the Maxwell Street district of Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you describe that a bit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It is where they have the pushcarts on the street. I don’t know
a word that would describe that, but you know, have all their wares displayed
right on the street and right on the sidewalk. It is several blocks long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The foster homes were not in that neighborhood, were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where were the farms?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The farm that I was on was in Woodstock, Ill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What sort of work were you doing on the farm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. We helped the farmer, you know, with regular farm chores. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
fed the cows and the horses and took the cows to the pasture and brought them
back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go to school during all that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes; sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Even when you were on the farm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes; sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that what is your educational background?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I finished high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Crane High School in Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you had any other formal education in the sense of special
training in any field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I would say no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us something of the background and early life of
your brother Jack, say, from the time 1925 forward, 1930, along in there? I
think he is a couple of years older than you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes. He is about 3 years older than I am. Well, I can tell you
that he always seemed to be in fights in one manner or another that I can
remember. He was like the bodyguard of the family, you might say, because in
those years we lived a half block from Roosevelt Road, and on the other side of
the road was the Italian section, and that was called, we used to call it Dago
Town, and the Jews couldn’t go near that street. And my sisters, well, if they
weren’t escorted to the streetcars then and nobody arranged to meet them at
the streetcar when they returned from work, they would be insulted and abused.
So that was, more or less, Jack’s job, if I recall, to meet them there.</p>

<p>He always had to go and meet them at the streetcar when they were returning
from work. In the morning I don’t think it was so bad because so many people
were going to the streetcar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old was Jack at that time that you are describing? I
gather it would have been after the family was brought together again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no, no. This goes back, it must have been in the twenties.
Maybe he was 15 years old or so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did the family come back together again after having
been separated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Maybe 1928 or 1929. I am not sure of these dates, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The reason I asked is because I was under the impression that
after your father left, there was a breakup of the family, and then you were
not living in this section of Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No. We moved west on Sacramento Boulevard. That is when
I remember coming back to the family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I am getting at are these instances that Jack had to act
as bodyguard against the Italian element, as you put it. That was not when
you were living in foster homes, was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Nor was it when you were living on the farm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no, no. That was in Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So it was either prior to the breakup of the family or afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After the reconciliation, or was it both?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I would say that I remember it was prior.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was just a teenager then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When the family was brought together again, which was around
1928, where did the family live then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. On Sacramento Boulevard in Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that is a different thing from the so-called east side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; that is further west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you didn’t have any such difficulties at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; we did, because even though we were west we were still
borderlining the Italian element, but we were further west. But it was an
improvement as to the other section.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, the family remained more or less as a unit, I gather it is
your testimony, until the war came.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, yes. Before the war Jack lived in San Francisco for awhile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did he live there, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It would be a few years. I don’t know exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think he went there with your sister.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That is right, sir; and he was working for a newspaper selling
subscriptions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know why they went out to the west coast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was just Eva and Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had the other girls married by then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I think one sister was married. I think my sister Ann was married
by then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever, yourself, been convicted of any felony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any business dealings at all with Jack prior to
1933, that is to say, prior to the time you moved to the west coast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Business dealings? No; because I was going to school then. I was
in grammar school and high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In 1933 actually you were 18.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I was in high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about your business associations with Jack after his return
from the west coast, until you went into the service? Did you have any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes. We worked together for, oh, I think maybe a year. He and
another fellow, I think his name is Harry Epstein, organized the Spartan
Novelty Co., which has been out of business for many years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that a corporation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; it was just a small company, very.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you a part of it then, or did you become a part of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I was only an employee. I worked with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the business of that company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It was selling cedar chests with candy and punchcards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did that business last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Only until, I worked with them only until the war broke out,
because I came back. I was working with them—right after the war broke
out December 7, then February—some time in February—I enlisted in the Seabees
of the Navy, and then I went into the service, and when I came out of the
service, my other three brothers were still in, and I started up the same type of
business, cedar chests with candy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This Spartan Novelty Co. was really prior to the war then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it lasted how many years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I only worked for them about a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is Epstein still living?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Still living? Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What business is he in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He sells, manufactures and sells—what would you call that—I
think onyx desk sets. I did have business dealings then. Do you want me to
go on now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I wanted to ask you about a trip that I think you took to Seattle
in 1941. Do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Seattle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Washington; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Seattle in 1941. In 1942 in the service, 1942.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you did go to Seattle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, because I went through the Seabees. I was in the Seabees, and
we shoved off from Bremerton, Wash., which, as you know, is right across the
bay from Seattle. That is the only time I remember being there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t remember the name of Daniel Sloan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I know the Sloan family in Chicago, but I don’t know if his name
is Daniel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know any Sloan family, and particularly a Daniel Sloan,
in Seattle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your statement is that you did not visit him prior to the war
at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or had you ever been to Seattle prior to the war?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No. Only with the Seabees when we stayed at Camp—I can’t
remember—I think it is Lewis, Fort Lewis there. We stayed with the Army
because they had no facilities, and we then went across to Bremerton and we
got on a ship there and left from there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you go to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The Aleutian Islands.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you stay in the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In the service? About 2 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And were you honorably discharged?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You left the service prior to the end of the war, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you explain how that came about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I had some trouble with a varicocele in my testicles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you sure it is not varicose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, they call it varicocele. It is a little different.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you get a medical discharge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, I think it is called a medical.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there any disability of such a nature that you received
disability pay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, 10 percent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you still do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes. Anyhow, how this took place, they were going to operate,
and they prepared me for the operation the night before. You know, they
shaved me and all that, and give me the pill, the sleeping pill or whatever it
was, and then the next morning I got up and I was dopey, of course, and I
felt—and there was no operation—no pain, and I couldn’t understand it, and so
when I was able enough to talk coherently I called the nurse and asked her what
happened. She says they changed their mind, and they were going to discharge
me from the service because they didn’t think I would be of much use to them
after the operation. I think that was the reason, or they decided that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you left the service in 1944?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you go then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whom did you live with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. And I started up this cedar chest business again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have a trade name then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I called it Earl Products Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was not a corporation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any kind of a punchboard operation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; that was before. That was the Spartan Novelty. Mine was
just selling—no, I sold some punchboards, that is right. I sold some punchboards
with my operation for about a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. These were candy punchboards, were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where you might win some candy, is that correct, if you punched
the right number?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, they could win a box of candy or win a pen set, I think
it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What area did you operate in as to the Earl Products Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I operated it through Earl Mail, more or less, through advertising
in the Billboard Magazine, and I shipped in, it wasn’t a large operation,
but I shipped out of State all the way across the country. I don’t remember the
States, but I did ship quite a few States over the years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were alone at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, I was by myself then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did your brothers ultimately join you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; as my brothers came out of the service, I took them in and
gave them a piece of the business. First Sam came out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they invest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or they just came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They didn’t put up any money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. When Sam came out, I gave him half interest. Then when my
oldest brother came <span class="locked">out——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; Hyman. And then I took him in. Then when Jack came
out, then I took him in. So we were all together for not too long because it just
wasn’t enough for all of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You all were sharing the profits?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Equally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was not on a salary or commission basis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I think we were sharing that equally. I am quite sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us what happened to the company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, then my brother Hyman left us, and then there was Jack,
Sam, and myself left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did Hyman leave for? What was the reason for his
leaving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. There just wasn’t enough money, and you know when there is
not enough money we have a few arguments in the family, so he decided to leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What business did he go into?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t remember. I think he went himself in some company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then there were three of you. What happened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Then my sister Eva had been in Dallas for, oh, a few years, and
she had been writing to Jack and telling him how good it was down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was she doing, do you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Running a nightclub. I think it was called the Silver Spur.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. So Jack and Sam had an argument, and so we just couldn’t get
along, so we decided to buy Jack out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say you and Sam decided to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, yes, yes; and we then bought him out. I think we paid him
something like $14,000 or $15,000, 14,000 and some hundred dollars, and he left
for Dallas, and he remained there until the incident happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When he had the argument with Sam which led to his leaving
the Earl Products Co., did he intend then to go to Dallas? Was that one of the
causes for his leaving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know what was in his mind. I don’t remember. I just
don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How was he paid?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. We paid him a lump sum, about $14,000 or $15,000, so when he left
he had quite a bit of money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In cash?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; he had quite a bit of money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he left for Dallas shortly thereafter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; very shortly thereafter he left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would have been what year, sir; about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I think 1947; 1947.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you keep in contact with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes; we corresponded, not too often. We came up every few
years. Of course, he came up for my mother’s funeral in 1944. Then he came up
for my dad’s funeral.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He came from the service for your mother’s funeral, I suppose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; that is right. At that time he was in the service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your father died in what year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I understand that you and your brother Sam changed your
name from Rubenstein to Ruby by a court proceeding for that purpose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that a coordinated decision between you and Sam?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You know, do you not, that Jack did the same thing about the
same time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that coordinated with him, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I don’t think so. In our conversations in telling him that we
were doing it, maybe he decided to do it, but I don’t know if it had any bearing
at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the reason for the change of name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, first, everybody called me Ruby, even in the service, and
wherever I went they called me Ruby, so that was one of the reasons to change
it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After Jack left did you and Sam continue in business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. For how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. For possibly 8 or 9 years, anyhow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You still lived in Chicago at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what was the cause of the breakup of the Earl
Products Co. which then consisted of you and Sam only, and of Sam’s removal
to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I didn’t like—he was supposed to handle the shop and I was
handling the office and the advertising, and by this time, when I say “shop”
you must understand we were now in the manufacturing business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What were you manufacturing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. We were manufacturing aluminum salt and pepper shakers, key
chains, bottle openers, screw drivers, small hammers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How large an operation was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I think our maximum sales there reached about a quarter of
a million dollars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many employees did you have at the maximum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Its maximum we had there was probably 40 at any given time.
Anyhow, he was supposed to run the shop and I was supposed to run the office,
and I didn’t think he was taking care of the shop the way he should, and I
told him several times, and finally he says, “Well, if you can do better, you can
take care of that yourself,” and he didn’t report to work for almost a year.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I was giving him his check every week. So, finally I decided
after waiting that long that the only thing to do was dissolve the partnership and
buy him out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much did you pay him when you bought him out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I paid him a total of about $30,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you say you actually paid him a weekly salary check?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Although he didn’t do any work at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was he doing as a matter of fact during that year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Nothing. He was just—just nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t even see him do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I didn’t see him for about almost a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you made no effort to correct that situation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes; I talked and members of the family talked to him, and
finally in order to dissolve it, I even called Jack and had him come up from
Dallas to see if he could, you know, make peace in the family, and he just
couldn’t do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That would have been around 1954 or 1955?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; right in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then when you bought out Jack, did you continue to operate
the Earl Products Co. alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You mean Sam?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Sam I mean; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes; I operated until 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then what happened to the company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Then I sold it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. To Herschel Oliff, and the reason I sold it was I was manufacturing
a line of novelties, and the Japan imports were just cutting down my business
and I could see the handwriting on the wall, so I decided I had better get out
while I can, which I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Then I didn’t work for, oh, 6 or 8 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I assume you were living off of the profits?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, he was paying me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean the purchaser, Mr. Oliff, was paying you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; he gave me so much down and so much a week so I was able
to get along. Anyhow, at that time I became depressed and I was thinking of
doing away with myself, so I went over to the veterans hospital in Chicago and
talked to them over there, and they suggested I come in there, which I did,
and I stayed a few weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you were hospitalized?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; they hospitalized me in the psychopathic ward there, and I
stayed there a week or two, and then I couldn’t see—there were so many of us
and they couldn’t, at least I didn’t think they were helping me, so I left one day.
I just up and walked out; but then I got sick again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you became depressed again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I became depressed again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, just a few days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you went back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. So I went back again. Then I decided well, the only way I can
help myself, I mean I can do myself any good, is get out of this place and get
a job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you married then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes; sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was to your first wife then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your second wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Second wife, and I said I’ve got my family you know, I had better
take care of them. The only thing that will help me, at least that was my
thinking, is to go out and get a job and maybe that is what I need, you know,
because I felt that I wouldn’t be able to hold a job or something. Anyhow
those were my thoughts. So, I went out and got a job for Worldwide Music in
Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the nature of that work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. They sell and place juke boxes.</p>

<p>The Seeberg Agency and the Rockola Distributors, a pretty big company, nice
people, and I worked there about a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your specific job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I was, I would say assistant manager. I supervised the other men
and the servicemen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t actually make the contacts with the taverns?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, I made some of those; yes, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, the machines were solely music machines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No slot machines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no, no. No slot machines. This is one of the better rated
companies in this field, very nice people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you stay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I stayed with them about a year. Then my best friend’s brother,
my best friend’s name is Mike Nemzin, his brother’s name is George Marcus,
that is his name legally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They have different names but the fact is they are brothers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; that is right. That is why I wanted to mention that. He
<span class="locked">owned——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say “he” who do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. George Marcus; I am now speaking of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The brother of your best friend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes. In fact, he was instrumental in my getting the other job for
Worldwide Music because he knew one of the—he was in the dry cleaning
business, George Marcus has today one plant in Marion, Ind. and one plant in
Benton Harbor, Mich., and has a brother-in-law running each one. And we had
been friends for about 25 or 30 years, and he approached me with the idea of
going into business with him in another cleaning plant if we could locate a good
one. You know, buy a going business, of course, and I was very much interested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is Marcus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; Marcus I am speaking of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, your best friend was his brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you were friendly with him for 25 years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir; yes. In fact, he originally helped me get started when
I first came out of service. I had no money to speak of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is Marcus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Marcus, and he lent me $500, I think, to get started.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, go on and tell us what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. And Marcus and I talked over the possibility of going into the
cleaning business together, and he being so successful, I was very happy that
he even, you know, came to me and was interested in my running the plant,
because he is more or less a silent partner.</p>

<p>So, sure enough, we checked out a few plants and then we happened to hear
of this plant in Detroit, Cobo Cleaners, that is the plant. It was originally
owned by the mayor of Detroit. And we heard about this plant and we went
to Detroit, checked that out and checked out the possibilities, and we decided
it was a pretty good deal. And so we bought that as equal partners. And that
was in 1961, October of 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you pay for it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. We paid for it, for the real estate and the business, $120,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you each put up half?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes. Of course, we only paid so much down, you know. We didn’t
pay the full price, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that is the business you are in now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you run the operation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; and he is more or less silent. He lives in Glenview, Ill., a
suburb of Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And as I understand it, he owns these other plants that you
mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And runs them <span class="locked">through——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The brother-in-laws. But he gave the brother-in-laws 35 percent
of each one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think for the record perhaps we had better state the names of
those other companies and the cities and the names of the brothers-in-law.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. OK. The name of the plant that George Marcus and his brother-<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>in-law
owns in Marion, Ind., is called Modern Laundry and Dry Cleaners, and
his brother-in-law’s name there is Harry Marks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that his sister’s husband?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Husband, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. And the name of the plant in Benton Harbor, Mich., is called
the American Laundry and Dry Cleaners, and the brother-in-law there who is
married to George Marcus’ sister is Elwood Jacobs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know those people, the two brothers-in-law?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes, you know, being close to my best friend for so many
years, I was always close to the family as a whole.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you have no interest in those plants?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you have a 50-percent interest in the Cobo plant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did we have some indication that there was a company or
something, sort of &amp; business enterprise called the Earl Ruby Co? Will you
tell us about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. When I sold the Earl Products Co., I sold the whole Earl Products
Co. and he was supposed to pay me—he gave me so much money down, about
$20,000 down, I think—and he was supposed to pay me the balance out so much
a year.</p>

<p>Well, after he paid so much, he paid me for about a year or so, he said he
can’t pay me any more money, he wants to make a new deal on the balance of
the money that he owed me. So we made a deal that he would only give me
$10,000 more. He owed me about $30,000 or so. We settled for $10,000 in cash
plus I would take over the camera manufacturing. We had a little camera we
manufactured. He would give me the tools and dies of that business, and also
the tools and dies to make a little nameplate that kids fasten on the back of their
bicycles. So when I took that over, I had to have a company name to run it,
and so I decided to call that Earl Ruby Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any associates in that company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no. And I since, last year I had to close that up. It was
just not doing <span class="locked">any——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That operation continued after you left Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. When I sold it to Oliff, you mean? Oh, yes; for awhile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No, no; I mean the Earl Ruby Co?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No. When I left Chicago, there was no Earl Ruby Co. It only
became after he decided he couldn’t pay me the rest of the money, then I had
to start all over again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were in Detroit at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes. I couldn’t use Earl Products because he owned that name.
I sold him the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But the operation of the Earl Ruby Co. manufacturing the
cameras and the bicycle plates?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I moved it to Detroit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, you moved it to Detroit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you operated then out of Detroit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, <span class="locked">but——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So you were operating at that time two businesses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The cleaning and <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes. Well, the other business I don’t think in all the time I had
it, I don’t think I did $10,000 worth of business in the 2 years that I tried to
run it. It just fizzled out and now there is nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It folded when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I folded it at the end of the year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. At the end of 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you had run it about 2 years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, about 2 years, I would say, and there was just no more sales.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
I tried to dispose of it or sell it, but I couldn’t even get a buyer, so I still own the
tools and dies but there are no sales.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Those are just put in a warehouse, the tools and dies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Hollebrandt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He is the supervisor of our plant. Is that the one you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I believe so. What is his first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Abram.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is he the supervisor of Cobo?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did he become so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. About a year ago, just about a year ago, a little over a year ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did this relationship come about? Did you know him
before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No. I had never heard of him before. When we came to Cobo
Cleaners, we had a supervisor by the name of Charlie Comp, and then after my
being there awhile, I could see that one of the reasons Cobo wanted to sell out
was the supervisor. He just wasn’t running the plant efficiently. And so I
talked to my partner about replacing him and we finally decided to replace him,
and we started looking for a replacement. And I mentioned it to everyone
I knew, and in the cleaning industry there is different types of cleaning processes,
mostly concerned with the type of soap you use, and we were using, ours is
what you call a solvent plant, and we were using—I can’t think of the name of
the soap. Anyhow, a special soap. I just can’t think of the trade name.</p>

<p>And the salesman or distributor in our area for this soap is Vernon Brooks,
and I talked to him about getting—asked him if he knew a good supervisor,
and he said he would let me know. And then in a week or whatever time passed,
he called me and says, “Yes, I have a good man in Rochester, New York.” And,
“I think he might be interested.”</p>

<p>So I contacted him and we had him come to Detroit so we could talk to him
and interview him, and then we wanted to see what type of a plant he was
running there, so Marcus, my partner, and I flew to Rochester one day and
Hollebrandt showed us through the plant he was running, and we liked him.
You know, he is a pretty nice fellow. And he seemed to know his stuff. So we
hired him. That is how we got to know him. Other than that, I had never
seen or heard of him before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long was it between the time that you first contacted Hollebrandt
and the time that he actually became the supervisor? What period of
time elapsed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I would say a couple of months anyhow. It took a couple of months.
Yes, it took a few months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Oscar Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oscar Robinson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know any person who lives at South Haven, Mich., particularly
at an address 58 Lakeshore Drive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes, I know those people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In South Haven, Mich.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I know their name is Ruby. I didn’t know his last name. My
in-laws own the cottage next door to them, 56 Lakeshore Drive, and so I used
to go up there on weekends, but I didn’t know his last name was Oscar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No, I didn’t say his last name is Oscar. I think it is either Ruby
or Robinson. What did you know his last name to be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Ruby, the same as mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But he is not related to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he had a cottage which is next door <span class="locked">to——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. My in-laws.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your wife’s——<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Harry C. Futterman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, that is my wife’s brother-in-law. He is married to my wife’s
sister.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What does he do for a living?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He worked for the post office until he retired a few years ago, and
now he works for a brother-in-law of his who is in the lumber business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where does he live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He lives at 7209 Northeast Prairie, in Lincolnwood, Ill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Lincoln?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Wood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Lincolnwood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. A suburb of Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Colley Sullivan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Colley Sullivan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no, it doesn’t register at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Dominick or Dominic Scorta
or Siorta?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Anesi Umberto?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, I think that is the one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I am trying to think. I did business with—no, that is another
name. I know a fellow by the name of Mario Anesi.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And who is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He is the fellow that used to make all our tools and dies in Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tools and dies for the Earl Products?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, I thought that is who you were talking about. Anesi Umberto,
no, I don’t know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a Mario Umberto?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Maybe that is the same fellow. I know him by Mario Anesi.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A-n-e-s-i?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know how you spell his name. I am not even sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you seen or had any contact with this gentleman in the
last year or so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes. In fact, he was just here, he was just in Detroit for the tool
convention or whatever they call them, and he called me just to say hello, because
he has tools and dies of mine in his place yet, old things, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was just in the last few weeks, I gather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes. That was about a month ago. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Prior to that contact with him, when was the next previous
contact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, he makes the camera shutters, camera shutter parts for me,
and I saw him in Chicago a little more than a year ago. I stopped in to discuss
changing—it is probably a year-and-a-half ago—changing the die for one of the
parts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you had any telephone conversations with him in that
interval, during that period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I think I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What would it have been about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Only about tools and dies. In fact, I tried to sell him the tools
and dies for the nameplate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right after I took it over from Mr. Oliff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It would have been about a little over 2 years ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; and then I would have to talk to him once in awhile about
ordering the parts, if I were in Chicago I would call him and tell him what I
need or something like that. But I know him as Mario Anesi.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you do know as far as your memory serves you, either a
person called Anesi Umberto or a person called Mario Umberto?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know anyone whose last name is Umberto, U-m-b-e-r-t-o?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know anyone by the name of Kirk Bibul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about a person by the name of Elliott Schwartz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Elliott Schwartz, he is married to another sister of my wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where does he live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have occasion to contact him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, sure. I see him, he comes in for events, marriages, bar mitzvahs
and all that stuff. In fact, I wanted to call him last night because I am
so close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is a social relationship, social and family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No business relationship?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I was going to have him manufacture the nameplates for
me, when I couldn’t sell them to Mario Anesi, he told me business was bad up
in New York, so I sent the tools and dies there, but we never used them, never
got any sales, so the tools and dies for the nameplates are just there not being
used at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, Edward A. Cobo was the owner of the Cobo Cleaners
prior to the time you bought it out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The junior, I bought it from the junior, his mother and his sister.
I think Cobo himself had passed away several years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you said he was mayor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. His brother, Al Cobo, was the mayor, but Al and Edward Cobo
owned Cobo Cleaners. The mayor owns half of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But when you bought it, the mayor had died?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And his interest had passed to his family, I take it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; to probably, I don’t know but I think it probably passed to
his brother and then his brother passed away and then the interest went to
the brother’s wife and son and daughter, and that is who we bought it from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Buddy Heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you had any contact with a company called the Anran Tool
and Manufacturing Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Are you sure it is Anran and not Anson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Maybe it is Anson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That is owned by Mario Anesi and his brother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that any contacts you would have had with that company
was really what you were talking about a little while ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; that is right. They made all the parts for us and tools and
dies for, oh, 10 years or more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t know if you stated what Mario Anesi’s brother’s name
was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. One’s name is Burt, that is how I know him by, Burt, and he has
another brother. I don’t even know his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are they all in this company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; now, Burt could possibly be Umberto, I don’t know, because
Burt is an unusual name for Italian people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your statement is that your contacts in the last 2 years
say with the Anesi’s or the Anson Tool and Manufacturing Company have been
as you have stated in regard to the dies and the manufacture of shutters and
so on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the Triangle Manufacturing Co.? Have you had
any contact with that company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Triangle? What do they make?</p>

<p>I once had a Triangle many years ago that made—I think it is Triangle—made
a set of cutting dies for me. I don’t know if it is the same company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where are they located, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In Chicago, I think. But I had very little—if I remember, it was
one order. But there are so many Triangles. I even think many years ago I
bought some cartons from a Triangle Carton Company, but you are saying manufacturing
company. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The Triangle Manufacturing Co. that I am thinking of is in
Oshkosh, Wis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It don’t sound familiar at all. Does it say what they make—because
in the years we were manufacturing we used to buy parts and things from
all over the country. But it doesn’t seem to register with me at all, Oshkosh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have any recollection of having made a telephone call to
that company on November 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. What year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, then I think I know who that is. I think, I am not sure now,
I think they make, what do you call it, bearings. I think they make bearings,
and the reason I called them, if it is the right company, I am not even sure of
that, is that my brother Jack wanted to make, had seen this twistboard, it is
a little board with a bearing underneath it, and you stand on it and you learn to
twist that way, and he, knowing that I had been in manufacturing and knew all
about manufacturing, asked me if I could find out where to get this type of
bearing. It was a usual, simple, very inexpensive type. So I don’t know how
I got their name. I think I called somebody. I learned of somebody that was
selling them or making them around Detroit, and I called them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean making those bearings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Making the whole twistboard, and I think they referred me to
Triangle, and I called them, if that is the correct company, and had them send
me a sample and a quotation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did anything come of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did Jack propose to do so far as you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, he was going to, you <span class="locked">know——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Manufacture it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Have somebody make it and distribute it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it possible that he suggested the name Triangle to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It is possible. I am not sure. I am not sure where I got that name,
because I think it was only one call I made, and then they said they would
send me the sample, and that was it. I forgot all about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they send the sample?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, yes; if that is the company, they sent the sample.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what did you do with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Nothing, because I then got the sample and saw what they wanted
for it. I think they wanted 45 cents just for the bearing part, and then you had
to make this board, and knowing something about manufacturing, Jack wanted
to sell it for about $2 retail, so I told him if the bearing cost 45 cents and the
top cost a quarter and you have got to put it in a box and package it, you can’t
come out, because you have got almost 80 cents cost to manufacture it and you
have got to give the jobbers 50 and 10 above, that means you get 90 cents. You
can’t work on a dime gross profit. And so I discouraged him about getting in it,
so that was the end of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he attempt to interest you in getting into this business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; he wanted to make it there in Dallas. He wanted to make it
in Dallas. In fact, he said he was going over, he was going to have, I think,
the Goodwill. I think they manufacture things at a very reasonable cost, and he
said that is how he was going to cut corners. But I discouraged him anyhow. I
couldn’t see it, and it was a good thing I did because I checked on the sales of the
item in the Detroit area and it was a flop, anyhow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Apparently this item wasn’t patented.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, can you comment as to what you know about an organization
called the Gilt Edge Associates, Finishing Corp., in New York City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; that is owned by Elliott Schwartz and his brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is that corporation? What do they do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. They do finishing on greeting cards. Some of their work is called
flocking, and they put that glittery substance on greeting cards and things of
that sort, and they also do silk screen work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what was your interest in those products?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That is my brother-in-law.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is your brother-in-law?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That is the same Elliott Schwartz that you brought up about. That
is the company he owns. I mean that is my brother-in-law on the wife’s side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know an organization or corporation, perhaps just a
company, called the James Welch Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. James Welch? No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you comment on what knowledge you have of an organization
called the Ipsilanti Buffing Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Never heard of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the Public Vending Co.? Do you know of that
organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No. Are they in Detroit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know. It doesn’t register at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the Troy Plating Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. When I was Earl Products, I used to have so many plating companies
to do work for us. Is this a Chicago concern would you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t recall that name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you had any contact with an organization called the General
Scientific Corp.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, General Scientific? Yes. I think that is the company we used
to buy lenses from for our camera, little glass lenses, if I am not mistaken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Coming back to the Troy Plating Co. in Chicago, do you recall
having occasion to have called them from Detroit on October 21?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Let me see, Troy Plating? What did I call them for? Yes, yes,
yes; I know what it is. I think I know what it is now.</p>

<p>In our cleaning operation we have a liner, a copper liner. It is a large basket,
very large, probably 30 inches in diameter and overall length of about 4 feet,
and it was corroded and the corrosion was coming off on some of our cleaning,
and I couldn’t seem to find anyone in Detroit to plate it. It was just an odd
shape. And so I called, I think that is the reason I called Troy Plating, to see
if they could do it. However, I finally located somebody in Detroit to plate it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Your testimony is that that was the occasion for calling the Troy
Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I can’t think of any other reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what about the Dixie Seal and Stamp Co. in Atlanta?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. When I took over the nameplate business, that is back from Oliff,
the fellow I had sold it to, Earl Products, and I received a few small orders for
plates, nameplates, and it was foolish to set up my complete operation for just
a few orders, and I knew that Dixie Seal and Stamp made a very similar item.
So rather than my setting up the whole operation to make the few, I had them
make it for me, and so I called them and talked to them on a few occasions,
and they did make some for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about the Berger Products Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Berger? Where are they located? That doesn’t strike a bell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t recall that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No. I make so many calls it is hard to remember all of them.
But that doesn’t strike a bell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you have already mentioned your relationship with Mike
Nemzin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; one of my very close friends, and his brother is my partner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Apparently you called him on November 14. Do you recall that
conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. November the 14th. I could have called him November 14.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where does he live?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In Chicago. I think the reason I called then is because George,
his brother, told me he was very sick.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you call him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t recall. Probably at his place of business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does he have any connection or have any home or business at a
place called Walled Lake, Mich.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Are you speaking of Mike Nemzin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know anyone in Walled Lake, Mich.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No. We have customers there, but I don’t know them personally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall any calls to this place, Walled Lake, Mich.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; but since we have customers there, I might have called and
we make so many calls to any of our customers at any given time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would anybody else in your plant be making such calls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes. We have a girl that does practically nothing but call
customers, for many different reasons, you know. Sometimes they send in a
garment and there is a hole in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is Walled Lake near Detroit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes; very close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you do have customers that come from that far?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What contacts have you had with the Denver-Chicago Trucking
Co. in Denver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, they are the people that shipped the tools and dies and the
punch press to take the plates to my brother-in-law Schwartz in New York, and
on route they dropped the press and broke it in half, and so I had many conversations
with them before I could get a settlement out of them. So I called
them several times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about a man by the name of Barney Rothenberg?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. What is his first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Barney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It doesn’t register with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or Horace Settersfield or Dettersfield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Delderfield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Delderfield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He is my landlord. I lease his home, or rent a home from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where does he live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He lives in California.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What business is he in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He is retired, as far as I know. In fact, I have never seen him.
I rent through his agent, but I send my checks to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you have had occasion to call him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was that about and when was it approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Gee, this was right after I moved in there, last fall, probably
September, around in there. When we first rented the place, we wanted to
know if it was all right to decorate, and I think that is why I called him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Coming back to—go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I called him for another reason, also. Well, I had to call him
and talk about the lease. See, I was taking over, subleasing from the people
that were in there before me, so I think I talked to him once or twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Coming back to Barney Rothenberg, does it help you any if I
suggest that he lives on Genessee Street in Pontiac, Mich.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; now, we go Pontiac. Our trucks go to Pontiac. I don’t remember
calling him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would it be a possibility, then, that that is a customer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, what about a man by the name of Sidney Jaffe, who lives
in Seattle, Wash.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Sidney Jaffe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have no recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Of any contact with a man by that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Henry Kenter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall anybody in the past mostly by the name of Chasin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The answer is no to Chasin. Do you know anybody in the Jaffe
family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Did you say do I know anybody in the Jaffe family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In Chicago I do. Julie Jaffe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is a lady?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; a man. Julius, I think is the correct name. I really don’t
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you known him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, about 20 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you some to know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, first, he is in the advertising specialty supply business, and
we used to do business together a little bit. And then I knew him before. He
grew up in the same neighborhood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember what his father’s name was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have any sisters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t know a girl by the name of Charlotte Jaffe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or Rosalyn Jaffe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about a man by the name of Berke, who married one of
the Jaffe girls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know any person by the name of Pasol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know of anyone who lives in Muncie, Ind.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Muncie? No; I don’t think I know anyone at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever been there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t think so; never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know if your brother Hyman Rubenstein was interested
in Jack Ruby’s twistboard enterprise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All I know is that he sent him a sample.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know if he attempted to get Hyman financially interested?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you have already said that he did not attempt to get you
financially interested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no. All he wanted me to do was get him the best source for the
different parts and he would assemble it in Dallas himself. I mean by that, he
would have somebody do it for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you do know Ralph Paul, don’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I met him in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how long ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I first met him, I think it was, down there about 5 years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the occasion of your meeting him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Through Jack. Jack introduced us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it just a social meeting or did you have any business with
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I didn’t have any business with him. No business was discussed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever had any business dealings with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I know Jack worked with him, but I really don’t know. At
least I think they had business dealings between themselves, but I am not sure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any financial dealings with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have occasion to lend him any money at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No. [I remember that my brother was going into business with
Ralph Paul and Jack was supposed to put in $6,000 which he did not have at the
time so he asked me to send $6,000 to him or Ralph Paul, which I did, and I’m
sure Ralph Paul endorsed the check but I haven’t located the check as yet. I
don’t remember whether I sent the check to Jack or Ralph, except that they were
supposed to pay the money back to me but never did. When they informed me
that the club had gone broke and they had no money to pay me, I wrote the
$6,000 off as a loss.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he owe you any money at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Ralph Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I call your attention to the fact that in your 1960 income tax
return you claimed a loss as a result of a worthless judgment note with reference
to Ralph Paul in the sum of $6,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That went through my company, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about that. Did Ralph Paul do any business or come to
be indebted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That was through the club. I sent money down to the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which club? The Sovereign or the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I think to organize the Sovereign Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who did you send the money to, and how much did you send?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t recall exactly. I think I sent more than one figure, than one
amount, that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about that transaction in general.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t recall. I would have to see—I don’t recall when I sent it
because it is 4 or 5 years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have occasion to get a judgment against Ralph Paul,
that is to say to sue him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Here is your return for 1960. It might refresh your memory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. This was sent, I think, to organize the Sovereign Club, and within
6 months the corporation folded or whatever it was, I don’t recall exactly. And
a new corporation was formed. I can’t think of the new name, because I was
out of the picture then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I was trying to get at is, first of all, how you had a judgment,
how you came to get a judgment against Ralph Paul in connection with
the organization of the Sovereign Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I sent the money down, but Jack, if I recall, asked me to send it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Suppose we approach it in another way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t recall the complete details on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us how you came to be financially interested, or at least to
advance money to Jack in connection with a club, the organization of a club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He called me and told me he needed some money for a good deal
club that was going to be organized or taken over or something. It was some
other club before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he tell you then how much he needed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I think I sent, I am sure I sent this down, if it so states.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean $6,000?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what was that to be, for the purchase of stock or a loan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I think I originally had stock in the corporation there, in the
original Sovereign Club Corp., and I think now at that time, at that time Paul
signed the note. I think this is how <span class="locked">this——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean the note for the money that you sent down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I think something—I am not sure because it was handled
more or less by my accountant. I am not positive how it was set up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But I mean your accountant would not have handled the original
sending of the money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I sent a check, I am quite sure I sent the check.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To organize the company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was an investment or a loan, that is what I am trying to
get at, or were there two separate transactions? You mentioned that Paul signed
a note, and that would indicate that there was a loan made of some sort, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then you mentioned that you got some stock which would
indicate that the money was for an investment rather than a loan, or perhaps
a combination. And that is what I am trying to find out, what it really was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I am really not sure. I am really not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you in a position at that time to advance that sort of
money without investigating the possibility?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, it was my brother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever loaned him money before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes; sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you have got it back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; once before I loaned him some money, several times I loaned
him money that I didn’t get back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Since he was in Dallas, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you never took any notes from him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I think I did several years before this, but I don’t recall all
the details on that, either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he ever pay you anything back on the various loans that he
made from you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much would you say that he owes you now then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Altogether?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I don’t mean including the money you may have expended
since November 24th, but I mean up to that date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I would say altogether maybe as much as $15,000 that I sent him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you have never got anything in return for it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever written off those loans as bad debts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The income tax return which you hold in your hand there says
it is a worthless judgment note. Do you recall that you actually filed the lawsuit
against Paul and recovered a judgment which you could not collect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I don’t <span class="locked">think——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall ever hiring any lawyers in Dallas or in the Dallas
area for that purpose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you clarify for us in anyway at all what this entry means?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I explained it to my accountant, and he said that is how
you write it off, as far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, you simply gave him the facts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The facts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he is the one who drew up the return?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think his name is on the front of this. It would have been
Mr. ——</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Let me see. Harold Kaminsky.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Isn’t one of your sisters <span class="locked">married——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That is what I was going to say. He is my brother-in-law.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which sister is this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Eileen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She married Harold Kaminsky?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He is an accountant, is he?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he handled this for you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You gave him these details?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you invested any money or loaned any money to Jack
after 1960?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. After 1960?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I think I did. I don’t remember the exact figure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was it in connection with, and about when did it occur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It must have been just about 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was in addition to the $6,000 that we have been talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I think that is the figure, but I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t know that you would have been able to take a loss for
a bad debt or loan made in 1960, that is to say on your return for 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I say I don’t recall. I don’t recall the exact—I would have to
check my records and see when I sent it down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. By your records, you mean checkbooks and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What sort of personal records do you have, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. We have a regular set of books.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you talking about the Cobo Cleaners?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; even before that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you have a personal set of books?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, sure. I mean by regular bank stubs and check stubs and statements.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You still have retained those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have occasion to make a telephone call or send a telegram
to Havana, Cuba, in 1962, in April of 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. April of 1962? The only reason I would have, Jack visited Cuba,
Havana. I don’t know if it was in April, and I may have talked to him. But
I don’t know, I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are acquainted with Jack’s visit to Havana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I know he went there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he go there once or more than once?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. As far as I know, once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Isn’t it a fact that that was in 1959?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know. If it was in 1959, then I couldn’t have made any
call or sent any wire. As far as I know, to Cuba, in 1962. I don’t remember
any, anyhow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know anybody in Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you think of any reason at all why you might have sent a
telegram or made a phone call to Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it possible that some employee of yours might have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I am trying to think. I can’t think of anyone. I knew of the fellow
that Jack went to visit there, a fellow by the name of McWillie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Jack told me about him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever met him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall that in the early part of this year, specifically on
January 6, you were interviewed by an Internal Revenue agent who asked you
about some calls and so forth, and that he mentioned to you something about a
call to Cuba, and that you told him that you thought it was a telegram?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. There should be some record of it if I did. I don’t recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall a conversation with this Internal Revenue agent
whereby he was questioning you concerning whether certain phone calls were
properly deductible business expenses?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that in the course of that conversation he asked you about
the Havana call and that you identified or thought that it was a telegram?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t see why. I don’t recall sending a telegram. I can’t think of
why it would be in 1962. I can’t think of any reason for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it possible that someone else could have called and charged it
to the Cobo Cleaners account?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I doubt it. I just can’t imagine who in 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In April of 1962 you were with Cobo Cleaners in Detroit already?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes. I can’t think of any reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any policy in your business about getting approval
before long-distance calls were made, or how did you manage that aspect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I mean I don’t watch it that close because we have so many.
Wouldn’t we know, or isn’t there somebody where we sent it so it could refresh
my memory? I don’t think I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Pratkins, or possibly Praskins?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever been to Cuba yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Coming back to that Welch Co. I mentioned a moment ago,
would it help you if I stated that I think they are located in Cambridge, Mass.,
and it is the Welch Candy Co.? Do you recall anything about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; you know my brother Hy sells candy. How long ago does this
go back? It doesn’t register with me at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This would have been in May of 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The name doesn’t register at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have no recollection that you yourself made any call to the
James Welch Candy Co. in Cambridge, Mass.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would there be a possibility that someone could have used your
phone and done that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t think they would. The only possibility, if my brother Hy
does business with them, the only possibility I can think of is that perhaps at
that time he was visiting me and called them. But he would ask me first, I think.</p>

<p>[I do recall making a call to Welch Candy to ask them if they were to continue
using my camera as a premium.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he visit you during the year 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what time of the year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it in the spring?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it about a year ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He stopped in a couple of times. Yes; when he is in the territory
he stops in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Suppose we take a breather for a minute.</p>

<p>(Brief recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Griffin, who is working with me in this area, has some questions
to ask you, so let’s get back on the record with the statement that this is
a continuation of the deposition under the same authority that was used for the
commencement of the deposition, and that you are still under the same oath
that you were at the beginning, and may we have this understanding, that if we
have any further recesses as I think we will, that the continuation thereafter
will be under the same authority that we started off with, and that you will be
under oath throughout? Do you agree to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to save some time. All right. Mr. Griffin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What I would like to do at the outset, Mr. Ruby, is to go back
over some of the names that Mr. Hubert had talked with you about before,
and maybe I can ask some questions which might be able to refresh your
recollection. He indicated to me that you didn’t recognize the name of Dominic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
Scorta. Now this would be somebody who lives or works in Chicago. Do you
have any recollection of any association with anybody like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Scorta, Scorta? Not at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Hubert also indicated to me that you didn’t recognize the
name of a man named Kirk Bibul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That is right; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any friends or acquaintances at Northwestern
University or in Evanston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Gee, I lived in Chicago all my life. I have got any number of
friends that went to school there but that name still doesn’t sound familiar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are your children of college age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; the oldest one is only 15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have anyone who has access to your house phone or
business phone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The only thing I can think of, I don’t know, is he a music teacher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is what I am asking you. Do you know a music teacher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. My wife was trying to contact a music teacher at Northwestern
to send my children to him for piano lessons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was that? I mean, how long ago was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It has got to be 3 years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is while you lived in Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; that is the only thing I can think of. Or if he has anything
to do with music teaching there, that is the only reason I can think of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Suppose we get this into the record. Could you give us the
names of the people who would have had access to the telephones at the Cobo
Cleaners, and who might have made long distance calls during the years 1962
and 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Any one of our employees could have. It would be very difficult.
I could give you the list, but there is quite a few.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would an employee make a long-distance call without your
consent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who would be authorized to make it without clearing with you
first, let’s put it that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Anyone; anyone probably other than my wife or my partner that I
can think of. That is about all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean by that that the only ones who would be authorized
without clearing it first would be your partner and your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; for very long-distance calls. Now we call the suburbs as I
told you, Pontiac, Walled Lake, or Mount Clemens. Those are 25¢ or 30¢ calls.
Because we cover that area and our trucks go there, our call girl will be calling
them any number of times during the month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many employees did you have during this period? I know
it would vary, but an average?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Probably 50.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now the phones are in the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Not all of them. We have one in the back end that anybody could
use.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that a pay phone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. We have a pay phone and a company phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What are the numbers of each? What is the pay phone number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The pay phone I don’t know. They took that out. I don’t know
what that is. I never use it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is still there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is the number of the regular?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. 860-3400.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where is that located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. We have one in the marking room as we call it at the back end of
the plant. We have four extensions in the front office where the girls are. We
have an extension phone in my office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are those all on the same line, the same number?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. 0400, 1, 2, and 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There are really three numbers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; then we have another phone, my private line which is 863—I
have got to look it up myself. I never use it. I don’t even have my own number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me put it this way. Who would have access to those phones
other than the public phone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I am not through yet. We have some other phones. We do dry
cleaning for J. L. Hudson Co. I don’t suppose you have heard of them. We
have two outside phones that we use in conjunction with their business. Now
you are saying 1962. When are you speaking of 1962, when? Because we didn’t
take over Hudson’s until December of 1962, so those numbers wouldn’t mean
anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What about 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. 1963, yes; we had this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What are those numbers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. 863-0566.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who would have access to those office phones as it were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, most anybody in the office. We have about 10 office employees,
and every once in a while some of the shop employees come up and use it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To make long distance phone calls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No. As far as long distance, I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you checked the long distance records in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t check them too carefully because we make so many. My
partner lives out of town, and I always talk to maybe Miriam in the plant. We
work together, we buy together sometimes. I talk to the Benton Harbor plant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you don’t spot check it to see <span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I really don’t spot check it that closely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I wonder if we could get from Mr. Ruby, maybe if you would
make a note of this, to provide us with a list of all of your office employees for
the year 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You don’t know if this is a music teacher, do you? Probably my
wife called.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We are speaking generally now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We are speaking generally. First of all, I am not addressing
myself to Mr. Bibul. Right now we are just addressing ourselves to the general
problem who else might have used your phone. Do you think you could provide
<span class="locked">us——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, sure; that is no problem.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. With a list of all of the office employees which you had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Sure; that is no problem.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You can limit that to the year 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. When you say provide a list, what do you want?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You want from April of 1962, don’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Give us the month of April of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. During the lunch period if you have a chance you might be able
to write that down too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You are talking of all office employees April 1962. Well, we had
some changes, several of them, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And then you can skip the remaining months and give us all of
1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You just want their names. You don’t want any addresses or
phone numbers or anything, just their names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, if you can give us addresses also we would appreciate it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes; I can take it off the employee payroll card. I can give
you the whole thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Gives us names, addresses, and telephone numbers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Do you want me to ask my wife specifically about that call to North
western University?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If you would?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; because that may answer that one. What is that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Kirk Bibul.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. And that was in April 1962?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That would be before that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; that was after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That was the latter part of 1962 and the first part of 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Late 1962 and 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And early 1963. I believe also you indicated to Mr. Hubert
that you didn’t recognize the name of the Ypsilanti Buffing Co. as anybody that
you had dealt with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or maybe you did identify that one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I don’t think so. Now when was this about? Maybe this
had to do with polishing or plating that same basket that we use in our dry
cleaning operation. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the Public Vending Corp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; Public Vending, where are they located? Is that a long distance
call, you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is a long distance call. When did you have this problem
with the plating that required some work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Last year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What part of last year would that have been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, excuse me; yes, the end of last year, that is right, the end
of last year, and that is when I think I called Troy Plating in Chicago, to see
if they could do that, and I may have called. I used the yellow pages. I tried
to get information from anyone as to who could do it, so I may have called
Ypsilanti, and they may have said no and I crossed it out of my mind immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now the General Scientific Corp. is not a corporation that you
recognize?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes; oh, yes. We bought lenses from them for the camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Berger Products?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That don’t register with me. What city? That isn’t in Cleveland,
is it, by chance, because I just called Berger Products I think Monday, but that
wouldn’t be on there. That is this Monday. See, we buy different articles from
different parts of the country, and it is hard to remember each one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are these purchases in connection with your drycleaning business
or some other business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Which, Troy? That was for the drycleaning. The lens, that was
for my camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you asked him, Mr. Hubert, about what percentage of his
time is spent <span class="locked">with——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you give us some idea what percentage of your time is
spent with the camera company and what percentage with the drycleaning
business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The camera company is practically nil. In fact, it is out of business
now. Over a 2-year period I only did about $10,000 gross sales, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Last year how much of your time was devoted to the camera
company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. When you say time, actually I took care of it more or less out
of my home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any other businesses last year besides the camera
company and the drycleaning business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I had the nameplate business. That all comes under Earl
Ruby Co., both of those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much of your time did the nameplate business take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Very little. I don’t think I did a thousand dollars in the last 2
years on that, so you can imagine how much time that took up. And then
that is dead now. In fact, the orders were so small that instead of manufacturing
the plates myself, for which I have the tools and dies, I had somebody
else do it for me that makes a similar item.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind of nameplates are they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. A little plate 3 inches by 6 inches made out of metal. It is very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
similar to the design of your license plate, but we would put the children’s name
on it, like John Jones, and they would fasten it to the back of their bicycle or
their wagon or what have you. This was a box top deal item that we used,
Armour’s Meats used it several years ago. They send in a box top from Armour’s
franks with 25 cents, and you get the plate, things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You say you held the dies on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I own them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You own the dies, but you were going to have somebody else
manufacture them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, I did, because it didn’t pay for me to set up to make 100
plates, because it just wasn’t worth it, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who did the manufacturing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Dixie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is this your brother-in-law’s company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Dixie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Dixie, no; that is just some people I never even met, but I knew
that they made a very similar plate, exactly the same size but slightly different
in design, and that I could substitute this for mine. Actually, his was a better
plate. It was made out of aluminum, which I did. And so that it wasn’t
necessary for me to go through all the bother and expense to set up my operation
to make the plate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is the Dixie Seal and Stamp Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In Atlanta?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now the Berger Products Co. is in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, Berger Products. They made a plate, and the reason I called
them, I have got to go back. When I sold my company, Earl Products, the fellow
I sold it to couldn’t pay me all the money. So we made a new deal. He gave
me some money and some of the operation back. That is how I got back the
camera and the nameplate. Berger is also in the nameplate manufacturing
business, and I wanted to sell him the nameplate business if I could. That
is why I called him. Now I know. It is Philadelphia. That must be the
Berger Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now did Mr. Hubert ask you if you knew anybody at the Mar-Din
Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; he didn’t ask me that. Yes; I know those people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How do you happen to know them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. They were one of our best accounts years ago when I first got
into manufacturing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This was in the Earl Products?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; the Earl Products Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What sort of things did they purchase from you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, they purchased aluminum salt and pepper shaker sets. That
was the main item. And then they also purchased some hammer and screwdriver
sets, because at that time I was manufacturing those, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you deal with these people while your brother Jack was
connected with Earl Products?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did Jack know these people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What does the Mar-Din Co. do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. They are distributors of general merchandise, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do they do any manufacturing that you know of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I don’t thing so, not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is the nature of their distribution? Is it mail order or
direct sale?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, it is both. I think some mail order and they have salesmen,
which would mean direct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember talking with Jack, your brother Jack, about
the Mar-Din Co. at anytime last year?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I think when he was talking about—I am not sure now, but I
think that he brought up their name when he was talking to me about going
into the manufacture of the twistboard, and he thought they would be a very
good outlet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you recall what you suggested to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I am not even sure of that. I can’t remember a conversation
that took place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember receiving any telephone calls from Jack in the
month of November before the episode down in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; we talked about the twistboard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many calls do you recall receiving from him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, at least three or four, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And were they all in connection with the twistboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. As far as I know; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I want to ask you to try to reflect on these calls and see if we
can’t discuss them one by one. If you can, try to think about the first time he
called you and the next time, and so forth, so that we can ascertain how your
dealings with him progressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I think the first conversation was probably to the effect that
he had a good item, and he was going to send me one, and he told me something
about it, it is a terrific item, and he wants to get into the manufacture of it, if
he could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he send you one of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; he did. In fact he sent me, I think he sent me a half dozen.
No; the first time he only sent me two, and then when I was down in Dallas,
you know, for the trial and so forth, I brought back a half dozen for my kids,
and so on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it that you were interested then in the project?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; not for myself. He wanted me to see if I could locate people
to make the parts at the least possible cost. He wanted to get into the manufacture
in Dallas, and he mentioned to me, because I was trying to discourage
him, because first of all he don’t know too much about manufacturing, and to
set up for one item, which I didn’t think was such a tremendous item, I thought
was a little bit ridiculous. And then he said that he would have the Goodwill
organization assemble it for him. I don’t know if you are familiar with their
complete operation, but they will assemble items for you at a very reasonable rate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This is Goodwill Industries?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And was that going to be done in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In Dallas. So then he sent me the sample, and somehow I think
this Triangle manufacturing came up. He may have mentioned it. I am not
sure because I don’t remember every word of the conversation going back that
far. I think I called Triangle, if that is their name. I am not even sure of
that. He called me and he said, he might have said, “call them and see what
you can do.” Anyhow, I contacted a couple of people in Detroit that I thought
might know something about the twistboard, because he told me it was so
tremendous in Dallas I figured it’s got to be known here in Detroit, although
I had never even seen it. So I asked—I happened to call a fellow that is a
salesman for toys and novelties and things of that sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I can’t even think. I know his first name is Henny, I can’t even
think of his last name, and he said it is a flop, it is a dead item here. They tried
it and it didn’t go over. So I think in one of the conversations I no doubt told
Jack that, and anyhow I got a sample and I think it was of this part that we
needed, the bearing part for this twistboard. Maybe I had better describe it.
It is a little board, fiberboard about 12 inches square and it sets on a bearing
like, and the bearing has another piece of press wood under it, and if you stand
on it and you twist, you twist around. That is what the item was. And I
couldn’t see it, especially it was selling for $3. I couldn’t see it. I just didn’t
think anything of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it Jack was enthusiastic about it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes; he was very enthused. He was going to get started.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you able to dissuade him at all from his enthusiasm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I think so, I think so. I really don’t know. As far as I know, I
think I did. I told him it just doesn’t pay to get into it, because the one that
was being marketed, if I recall he told me was selling for $3. So he said if he
could sell his for $2. it would be tremendous. But I figured out the cost to him
about 80 cents and if you sell the jobbers, you have got to give them 50 and 10 off.
By the way, I have gone all through this with him but I just want to make it
clear. So that means he is going to get 90 cents. In addition they want 2 percent,
so you get 88 cents, approximately, and it costs you 80 cents, so you can’t be in
business on 8 cents gross profit on an item that you are selling for 88 cents. It is
just impossible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And in which telephone conversation did you have this discussion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In one of them, not the first one, because I didn’t have all the
information then. But after I got all the information, I called him or he called
me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember Jack calling you after the telephone call, a
few days after the telephone call that was made in connection with Triangle?
Do you remember that telephone call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I think so, and that is when I told him I think they wanted
45 cents, and that is when I broke down the price structure, that it just didn’t seem
feasible to consider manufacturing it if you had to sell it at $2 and I probably
told him at that time, I checked into it and it was a flop in Detroit, so it was
my opinion it wasn’t good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack call you in November about anything other than the
twistboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t think so. I think the only thing we discussed other than—maybe
how is the family, you know, how are your kids, which is the general
conversation when two brothers talk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he ever call you in connection with Eva’s illness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, yes; he did mention that, that she was going to have an operation,
she was going to have an operation, she had an operation, and he said, “I
think you should call her or write her” or something. I don’t know, I may
have even called her in the hospital, I really don’t remember, but he said she
was feeling very bad, and for me to either write her, send her a card or call her,
and I don’t know what I did. I did something but I don’t remember exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. While Jack was living in Dallas, had you talked with him about
other business ventures that he had, outside of his clubs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, a few years ago I talked to him about, he had a vitamin called
Miniron, or something like that. In fact, I tried to discourage him about that,
but I couldn’t, and in fact I think if I remember correctly, I sent him some
money to try it, but it just didn’t go. It was a vitamin, a liquid vitamin of some
kind that he thought was terrific. He was always taking diet pills and stuff
like that. He was whatever the name for that is. Anyhow, he went for all
kinds of diet remedies that came on the market. But it never seemed to help
him much because he liked to eat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any recollection of when he was selling these diet
pills or these vitamin pills?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, it is a few years back. It had to be—it was a liquid. I don’t
think it was a pill. It was a bottle of some kind. In fact, he sent me some.
It is several years back, I mean 4, 5 or 6 or 7. I don’t remember exactly. It was
several years ago I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you recall your activities of the weekend of November 22,
23, and 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The 22d, Friday, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I was at work drycleaning when we heard the news on the radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That the President had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; first shot. Then we were waiting for additional news, and
then finally it came through that he was dead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain at the drycleaning plant that day?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Gee, I would say probably until 6 o’clock. That is my usual hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Friday I always go home to dinner Friday night because it is traditional
in our family. Jewish people, we have a big meal on Friday nights,
so very, very seldom would I miss a Friday night dinner. I am quite sure I
went home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don’t have any specific recollection of what you did Friday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I was deeply upset, like most everybody else, I think, and I
went home I know at 6 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have a specific recollection of going home and being at
home on Friday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; not specific, but I can’t see what else I would have done but
go home to eat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what you did in the evening after you ate, Friday
evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it your practice to go to religious services on Friday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You wouldn’t go on Friday night, would you? No; I don’t go on
Friday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you of the Jewish faith?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And do you have a particular temple or synagogue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. More or less, yes, but I am not what you call Orthodox. The Orthodox,
you know, just like other religions, they go every chance they get more or
less. But I am not of the Orthodox.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But the temple or synagogue that you belong to, when does it
regularly hold services?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It probably holds them—I don’t know. I know they have them
Saturday. Saturday they always have services. I don’t think they have services
there Friday night. They don’t have services on Friday night as far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall your own religious practices when you were living
in Chicago with Jack? Did your practices and feelings at that time differ from
his?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I would say—can you make that a little more clear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Looking back to the time when you and Jack saw each other
regularly when you were in Chicago, when Jack was in Chicago, were your religious
practices the same as they are now? Were you any more religious then?
Did you observe the holidays more closely?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You want to compare Jack with myself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. First of all, let me ask you about your own practice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, you must understand, first, that it is very unusual for a
Jewish boy not to be bar mitzvah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am not asking about particular ceremonies, but I am asking
you about the regular habits of weekly attendance and so forth. Did they differ
in the period before 1948 from the way they are now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Mine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I would say I go more often since I got married, of course,
because that is the Jewish tradition. When you get married, you have children,
my kids go to Hebrew school, they went to parochial school, in fact my son
graduated from the Hebrew school in Chicago, and so I would say I am more
religious since we have children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you were single in Chicago, how did your religious
practices differ from Jack’s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I would say he was a little more religious than I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he attend the synagogue or temple more often than you
did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I would say more often than I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he go regularly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I wouldn’t say regularly, but he did go more often than I did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. About how many times a year would he go other than on high
holidays?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. This goes back so many years. You know he has been away more
or less from me for 17 years now, so it is pretty hard to remember. And you
know he is not the only one in the family. We still have six more children. I
can’t even remember all their birthdays, remembering who went where on
holidays.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If you don’t have a specific recollection, I don’t want to ask
you the question, then. Let’s go back to the 22d, 23d, and the 24th.</p>

<p>Do you recall what you did on Saturday, the 23d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I think I went to work, the usual time, probably 7:30, and probably
worked until 6 o’clock. Saturday is a busy day for us, and probably went
home so far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You used the word “probably.” Are you indicating that you
don’t really have any specific recollection of what you did that Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I would say I probably went home, but I am not sure. I would
have to check with my wife to make sure. I don’t think we went out, because
we were in deep mourning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You were, or you were not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I said we were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You were in deep mourning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. So I don’t think we would have gone any place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What do you mean when you said you were in deep mourning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, we cried a lot in our family when this happened, I mean
actual tears.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you tell us when this happened? Can you describe to us
where and when and who was present? What was happening around you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I don’t know exactly what our—but I know after this happened,
probably on Friday night, my wife was definitely in tears at that time,
and I was, too. We both greatly admired him. In fact, my wife on many
occasions, even before the incident, she just loved him. There was nobody
greater than President Kennedy. She made a statement many times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you both registered Democrats?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I was a Democrat all my life. In fact, I worked for the Democratic
headquarters in Chicago many years ago. All our family has been Democrats
all our lives, as far as I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what you did Sunday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. On the 26th? Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The 24th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The 24th. We needed some electrical work done at the plant,
and the only time to do it without interfering with production was to have it
done on Sunday morning. So I had the electrician come in on Sunday, and I
met him there, I think, about 10 o’clock probably, Sunday morning, at the plant
to do this work, and I was there until—I just wanted to get them started, and
I had one of my other employees there to watch things, you know, because we
had an outside contractor, electrical contractor here to do the work, and there
is a lot of clothing there and we wanted to be careful if they worked on the
ceiling that they didn’t drop dirt on the clothing and so forth.</p>

<p>So I left. I was there maybe 2 hours, I don’t remember, anyhow I wasn’t in
the car but 5 minutes or so driving one of the other employees—another employee
who stopped in home—I was en route to drive him home. We had the radio
tuned in. That is when I heard—no, before I left this Mike Nemzin, who is my
best friend, and his brother is my partner, he was in the hospital with an
<span class="locked">operation——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The brother or Mike Nemzin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Mike Nemzin. He had some kind of surgery on his ribs or something,
a very serious one, though, and so I thought I would call him to see how
he was.</p>

<p>So I called him Sunday morning, it must have been about 12 o’clock, from the
plant, I was at the plant, mind you, and as I am talking to him, he is in his
bed in the hospital, he is watching television or radio and he says to me, “I can’t
talk to you. Somebody just shot Oswald,” he says.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
“I’ll talk to you some other time.” You know, because we were all excited,
especially he was. So I hung up. And we didn’t have the radio on in the plant,
but we left a few minutes thereafter. And in the car, as I said, about 5 minutes
later, as I am in the car driving, just drove probably a mile from the plant,
which wouldn’t take more than 5 minutes, it comes through on the radio that
Oswald has been shot and the fellow that did the shooting is Jack Ruby, owner
of the Carousel Night Club in Dallas, and I immediately knew it was my brother
because that was the name of the club he owned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you say you were riding with someone at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Jim Stewart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does he still work for you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where is he located now; do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right now he is in the hospital, Receiving Hospital in Detroit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What did you do when you heard that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I was very upset, of course, and he said—I was driving—he
said, “You had better pull over to the curb. You just turned white as a ghost.”</p>

<p>So I pulled over for a second or for a few minutes to recuperate my senses,
so to speak. And then I said, “I had better take you home,” which I did. Then
I went home. I drove home, and I called my sister in Chicago. I don’t even
know which one I called. There is two of them. And they knew about it, of
course, by that time, too. This was a half hour later and they probably heard
it on the air. And they were all upset, of course. And I said, “Well, I had better
come to Chicago.” So I called the airport and I flew to Chicago Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain at the cleaning plant after you finished
talking with Mike Nemzin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Just a couple of minutes, just a few minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And what other people were in the plant at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. When I talked to Mike Nemzin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The electrician, I think, and his helper, he had a helper, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember the name of the electrician?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you give us his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The trade name, I think, is Marco Electrical Contractors, and his
first name is Marty. That is with a “c”. It is a little bit of an odd name, but
I have it available there if it is necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. His last name starts with a “c”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I think that is where he got this Marco. And then, of course,
as I told you I flew to Chicago, and my brother met me at the airport, if I am
not mistaken, Hyman, and this was already before I could get reservations and
get the plane and pack some clothes and all. It was late in the afternoon, and
I think I arrived there, if I am not mistaken, probably 6 o’clock in Chicago,
and it takes about an hour to get there.</p>

<p>Anyhow, no sooner I got in the house, you know, of course, the reporters were
calling and it was a real—we tried not to talk to everyone, to anyone, if I
recall.</p>

<p>When I got there, then my sister said that there were some men at the door
and they said they were FBI men or special agents, and she thought they were
reporters so she wouldn’t let them in, and she was hysterical now, to put it
straight. And so then we got a call. We did answer the phone, of course, and we
got a call from an agent, I can’t remember his name, but he said that they want
to get in and talk to us and we wouldn’t let anybody in. You know, we just
wouldn’t let anybody in. So he says, “Here is a number and call this number
and my name is”—one of them was White, and I can’t think of the other one,
one of the agents in Chicago. “Call this number and they will verify this that
we are special agents.” So I said OK. So I went out to a pay station and called,
and sure enough they said yes, they are agents, and so I walked back into the
house the back way, and I saw them standing in the front, by the way. You
know, there were about three or four of them. And I told my sister we had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
better let them in, they are special agents, which we did. There were four, I
think. Four agents came in at one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did they interview you and your brother and your sister?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; all of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you being interviewed simultaneously by the Bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; in different parts of the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So that while you were being interviewed, one or more of your
brothers and sisters were also being interviewed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes; they talked to one sister, I think one agent talked to her in
the kitchen or dining room or another part of the house, and one or two were
with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, at the time the Secret Service agents had talked to you,
had you had a chance to talk with any of your family in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Had I?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Excuse me, at the time that the FBI talked to you, did you have
an opportunity to talk with any of your family in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t think I even had time. I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don’t recall having talked to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; but I don’t think so at all. There was just not enough time.
I called Chicago, if I recall, that is all I called. I don’t think I called Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had Hyman or your sisters in Chicago had a chance to talk with
Eva or Sam?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you arrived in Chicago and talked with <span class="locked">Sam——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. With Hy, you mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. With Hy, yes—did you discuss any contacts that Hyman had had
with Jack over the weekend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did you remain in Chicago on the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I just remained overnight and went back to Detroit, because my
wife called me late at night, I don’t know what time it was, very late anyhow,
and she said, “You had better come home. The reporters are just driving me
crazy.” She was terribly upset. So the next morning I flew back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. While you were in Chicago, did you make any plans with respect
to obtaining an attorney for your brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. While I was there for that little while?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; but I think if I recall correctly Tom Howard was already in
the picture. I heard his name. I didn’t talk to him, but as far as I know I
heard his name on the air, that he was representing Jack, or something to that
effect. At least I think so. But I don’t know if that was before I left for
Detroit or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was the nature of your meeting with your brothers and
sisters in Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, they were upset and they suggested I come there. So I came
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any discussion as to what you could do for Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. We probably did, but there was nothing definite made, no definite
arrangements. I know that I called, I think, Tom Howard. He was the first
attorney, if you remember, to represent Jack, Monday morning after I arrived
back home, because when I arrived there we had police at the house already,
and the chief of police and my wife came down to meet me at the plane, and en
route back my wife was telling me how the newspaper reporters were bothering
her, they wouldn’t let her sleep. They were there until 2 o’clock in the morning
and whatnot, you know. So I didn’t know what to do. So I asked the chief
of police—his name is Sackett—a very nice man—what would he suggest. They
all wanted information, a press conference or what. He said, “If I were you,
the only way you are going to get rid of them is give them a press conference.”
But I didn’t know if that was the correct thing to do, so I am quite sure I
called Tom Howard and told him who I was and told him that all these news
people wanted a press conference and what should I do. And I told him what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
the sheriff, the police chief, had suggested, and he says, “Well, there is no harm.
You might as well do it and get it over with.”</p>

<p>So we called a press conference, I think it was, for 2 o’clock in the afternoon,
something like that, and our rabbi came over, Rabbi Adler, and then I think
right after that, I think some special agents called and came in or came over, and
I think there were some there in the evening. Again, I think they came. And
that ended that day. That was Monday. And then we started talking about
attorneys and what to do and who to use.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You say, “we started talking about it.” Who was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I talked to the family, and I talked to—we talked back and forth
so many times. I am talking about Chicago, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. And I think they were in touch with Dallas. I think Eva and Sam,
they were talking back and forth, more or less continually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have anything to do with getting Mr. Tonahill into the
case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Indirectly; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you who you directly got into the case, if anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Belli.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you tell us how Mr. Belli came to get into the case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Jack called. They let him use the phone down there. He talked
to me or someone. Anyhow, we were talking about a lawyer then. We were all
excited about getting the right lawyer. And he mentioned—I am trying to get
it straight in my mind here. Oh, yes; he mentioned somebody wanted some information
on his life or something, a life story or something, something to that
effect, and he said to contact Mike Shore in California, in Los Angeles, who is a
friend of ours, and he was a pretty well known publicity man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know Mike Shore before you called?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to know Mike Shore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, actually, I know him since high school days in Chicago. He
originally lived in Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was he a classmate of yours in high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; but he went to the same school, if I remember, and I really
didn’t get acquainted with him until after we got out of school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was your acquaintance with Mike Shore after you got out
of school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Just on a general hello and how are you basis, nothing real close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But in what connection would you see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Then he <span class="locked">became——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you understand my question? In what connection would
you see him after you got out of school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I used to be a lifeguard at a swimming pool close to where he
lived and he used to come over there once in a great while, just a few blocks
from his house. And he used to—he was a Good Humor salesman, and we
would go out and see him where he parked his truck or something once in a
great while. But that was because he was more friendly with other people
than he was with me. In other words, I wasn’t one of his buddies. I would
go along just for the ride.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you do any business with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I am coming to that. Then he became—he opened up the Mike
Shore Advertising and he is the one that was behind Earl Muntz, you know,
and the cars and the television. That is Michael Shore. And I did some business
with him along in manufacturing. He got into the manufacturing of an
item, a food seasoner. It was a large aluminum needle and you filled it with
some different meat flavors and you injected it in the meat. Somebody talked
him into it. He was doing very well, and he invested in it. Anyhow, it wasn’t
made correctly so they couldn’t sell it, so he asked me since at that time I was
in manufacturing, if I could correct the defect so they could at least sell them
and market them, which I did. They shipped all these to me, I don’t know how
many thousand, 5,000 or 10,000, and we reworked them and fixed them and sold
them for him. Then not too long after that Muntz practically went bankrupt, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
he closed the Chicago office and moved back to California. So, anyhow, I called
Mike.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you another question. From what you have said,
I take it that Mike Shore first had contacted your brother Jack or somebody
in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Jack told you to call Mike Shore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, had Shore contacted Jack or what gave Jack the idea of
suggesting that you call Shore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, Jack knew that I knew Mike Shore, and he was, you know—he
had been in advertising, was the only one we knew that could give us any
advice as to what to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had Jack had someone approach him in connection with a life
story or something like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; he said several people were trying to contact him through
Howard and wanted a life story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The first you heard about this, though, was when Jack called
you and asked you to contact Mike Shore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; as far as I know. Now, wait—I don’t know if he talked to
me or he talked to one of the members of the family, because we had so many
telephone calls from those first few days I can’t recall all of them. But, anyhow,
the word came to me to call Mike Shore and ask his advice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you recall how long after Oswald was shot that this
call of yours took place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, just a day or two later, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And I take it you did call Mike Shore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you call him in California?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I called him in California.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And about how long did your conversation with Shore last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Several minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Ten or fifteen minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know. I really don’t know. Anyhow, I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, tell us what that conversation was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I mentioned that Jack had said that people were interested
in a story on Jack and Jack had said to contact him, ask his advice. And so
he says, “Gee, that is a coincidence,” he says, “because I’ve got somebody sitting
right here in my office that would be the perfect man to do a story on Jack
if one is going to be done.” And he says, “His name is Billy Woodfield.” His
real name is William Woodfield. So he says, “I think you ought to come out
here,” the conversation got to that, “so we can talk it over.”</p>

<p>So I flew out there a day or two later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that all there was to the conversation at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; lawyers weren’t mentioned yet as far as I remember. I don’t
think we mentioned the lawyer in the first conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had you discussed with your family or with Tom Howard before
you called Mike <span class="locked">Shore——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What had been your discussion about selling the life story with
your family and with Tom Howard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, the question came up that we would need money for a good
lawyer, and this was one of the solutions to raising money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Before you called Mike Shore, are you saying that you had discussed
getting a lawyer other than Tom Howard, or when you use the term
good lawyer are you talking about paying Howard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No: we were talking about a lawyer other than Howard now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Who had suggested that you should get a lawyer other than
Howard or how did that idea arise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That was, I think, between our family, the family itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did you discuss this with Howard before you called Mike
Shore?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Wait, you are ahead of me. The first conversation I didn’t mention
a lawyer to Mike Shore yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I realize that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But I am still asking you, you had indicated to me that the
reason that you were calling Shore and thinking about a life story was that
you were going to need money for another lawyer. The life story, as I understand
it, is tied in with the idea of getting the money for a lawyer, or was there
another reason for selling the life story?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I think I talked to Tom Howard because we never heard of
him, of course. In the meantime, I think in conversations back and forth, we
talked with another lawyer there, somebody talked to him from the family or
maybe it was relayed through my sister Eva down there—and I have a brother
Sam in Dallas—do we need another lawyer. And then we learned that they
were already trying to get a lawyer.</p>

<p>Now, you must understand, we have to go back to Tom Howard. Tom
Howard is a bondsman in addition to being a lawyer. That is what he is noted for
there. So then I think I talked to this other lawyer, Stanley Kaufman. He
was my brother’s civil lawyer down there. And I asked him if he knows a good
criminal lawyer, and he says, no, he can’t recommend anyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me interrupt you, Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Excuse me. I can’t remember the exact sequence of all these
conversations, because they were going back and forth all day and night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Maybe we can reconstruct it by asking you questions. From
what you have said, I take it that by the time you called or somebody talked to
Stanley Kaufman, the idea had been implanted that you would need a lawyer
other than Tom Howard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, who had planted the idea? How did that idea develop
that you would need a lawyer other than Tom Howard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t remember exactly, but it could have been even my own
thoughts, because a day or two after the shooting and the papers started to
print stories, and stories about Tom Howard, and I realized who he was, and
he was suspended at one time, I immediately thought this was not a good lawyer
to have for my brother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, what was Jack’s original attitude, if you know, about
Tom Howard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He wasn’t too crazy about Tom Howard, as far as I could see,
from what he told me, because he said Tom Howard contradicted himself a few
times to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But did Jack, to your knowledge, develop the idea on his own
that he should get somebody other than Howard, or was this suggestion raised
to Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That I don’t know. You are asking me what his thoughts were.
I don’t know. I can’t answer that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I didn’t know if you had contact with him or not. Now, to your
knowledge, were any other Dallas lawyers contacted besides Tom Howard before
the final team of Belli, Tonahill, and Burleson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes; Belli was the main one, you know. He was the first one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; but before Belli was brought in, were any other Dallas
lawyers, or Texas <span class="locked">lawyers——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes; they talked, Howard—Howard and I discussed this, and
he said he needs help, he wouldn’t mind another good lawyer. So we mentioned
several names. He talked to Percy Foreman, and Percy Foreman, he told me
Percy Foreman wants $25,000 as a retainer before he will even step into the
case. So he says, “I know you don’t have that kind of money so that eliminates
him.”</p>

<p>However, later, upon talking to Foreman, he denies that. He said he only
asked for $2,500.</p>

<p>Anyhow, they contacted Stanley Kaufman. Stanley Kaufman contacted Fred
Brunner. He is a Dallas criminal lawyer, very good. And the story I got is
he says, “Okay, I’ll handle the case. I will be right down to take over.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
He never showed up. We found out why. He is Henry Wade’s best friend,
and so it just wouldn’t work out. He just couldn’t take it. Although he never
called, we understood that that is what happened, because they down there
found out that he was Henry Wade’s best friend, and so he probably for one
reason or another, he couldn’t take the case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You don’t have any personal knowledge, however, that the
friendship with Howard was the reason that Brunner didn’t take the case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With Wade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. With Wade. You don’t know this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I talked to Brunner myself when I was down there later on.
Brunner said something to the effect—I don’t remember the exact words. I ran
into him in the county jail. I don’t remember what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he say anything to you about why he didn’t get into the case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I am just trying to, if I can find the words or something close to
what he said. We just met in the hallway, and he said—I can’t recall that
conversation at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Brunner <span class="locked">mention——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. But I had a later conversation which I remember very <span class="locked">clearly,——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. This was after Jack received the sentence, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Then Brunner told me that he now wants to help Jack. He feels
that this would never have happened if he had handled the case originally, the
verdict, you know, the death verdict, and that I should talk to the family and
think over about him taking over the defense.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he mention anything about Henry Wade at that conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; he said, “Even though I am very close,” words to the effect that
“even though I am very close with Wade, don’t let that worry you,” or something
to that effect. But I forget that first conversation, and I just don’t want to give
you <span class="locked">words——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had he mentioned Wade in the first conversation that you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I am not sure and I don’t want to just—no, we contacted Percy
Foreman. You want to know who else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I didn’t know. This is only that I learned from Howard. He said
he contacted Percy Foreman. He contacted Fred Erisman, a retired judge.
There is another one, another very good criminal lawyer, but I can’t even think
of his last name to look it up. Is it important? I’ve got it here, but I just
can’t remember the name.</p>

<p>Oh, yes; here is another one they talked to, I understand—Jim Martin. In
fact, he was in the case more or less with Howard. Oh, that is Charlie Tessmer,
the other lawyer they contacted. And he turned it down. Why, he never told
us, but he turned it down. In the meantime, I had talked to Charlie Bellows
from Chicago who is now acting as consultant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you happen to contact Mr. Bellows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, one of my close friends in Chicago worked in his office, another
lawyer, Rheingold, Milton Rheingold.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Incidentally, let me ask you here, did you know a lawyer in
Chicago by the name of Weiner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. A lawyer? I don’t think so, not a lawyer. I know a doctor, not a
lawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Go ahead now with your contact with Bellows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. So we talked to Bellows. I talked to him, rather. And he said he
was going to be rather busy, and he wasn’t sure he could take the case. As a
matter of fact, that is who I wanted originally, because we knew him. His
office represented me before Rheingold, was in his office with him, was my civil
lawyer in Chicago, more or less, so you know at least we had a knowledge of
who we were going to hire. And, in addition to that, he is a great criminal
lawyer. He is head of the American Defense Lawyers, and all that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And had you contacted Bellows before your telephone call to
Mike Shore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I am quite sure I did, and I asked him to give me an idea of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
the fee because, you know, expenses. Well, he said his fee would run anywhere
from $10,000 to $15,000, because he figured it would be a 2- or 3-month trial,
plus expenses.</p>

<p>So I, of course, asked him what his expenses might be, and he says it shouldn’t
be more than, if I recall, $100 or $200 a week for his own expenses, he said, because
he doesn’t live highly and knowing me he is going to keep it down as
low as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are talking about Bellows now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Bellows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Ruby, had you discussed a fee with Tom Howard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I did, but I don’t know when.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was the fee that was finally arrived at with Tom Howard?
What was his fee to be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. His fee was originally, if he would stay in all the way, he told me
from $10,000 to $15,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And how many lawyers did Howard suggest would be needed
besides himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I mentioned the names, you know, like Bellows. In fact, he
talked to Bellows, and we were in the process of probably working something out
with Bellows, but he was too busy, and asked—then the question came up as to
whether Bellows would be a risk in Dallas, since he is Jewish. And I talked to
about a half dozen other lawyers, and I even talked to the best criminal lawyer
in Detroit, Joe Louisell. I had a meeting with him. I asked his advice. He
says, “Don’t bring a Jewish lawyer down there.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was Howard’s view?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Howard agreed with that. So that more or less took Bellows out
of the picture. Now, in the meantime, I am back, going to California. So I go
to California. They meet me at the airport. Is everything pretty well in sequence
up until now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is all right, we will clarify. We will ask you some questions
about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes; first the conversation, to get back to Tom Howard, the
first one or two conversations, as I said, I talked to him Monday morning. Then
I think I talked to him Monday night. I don’t remember, I talked to him any
number of times. And in our discussions we talked money, costs. He mentioned
“It is going to take a couple of months. You have got to figure anywhere total
expenses close to $50,000.”</p>

<p>I never knew all these things existed that you have to hire a special investigator,
and he wants $10,000. And you have got to have an appeals lawyer like
Burleson. That is how he came in. You have got to pay him.</p>

<p>Anyhow, he broke it down, roughly, over the phone he says it may run $50,000.
So that is why I started asking any lawyer I talked to, like Bellows, “How much
are you going to charge? I have got to know all these things. Give me an
idea what we have to raise.”</p>

<p>Then I had all of this information more or less in the back of my mind, how
much have we got to raise to get Jack a decent defense counsel. Then I go
out to California. They meet me at the airport, Mike Shore and Woodfield.
The first thing they say, “Have you got a lawyer yet?” I says, “No.”</p>

<p>I am still talking to Bellows. He is not out yet, you see. He is not out of
the picture. Howard is still supposedly trying to contact somebody else that
is good. I haven’t been to Dallas yet. In the meantime, as I said, he had
contacted Foreman and Charlie Tessmer and Fred Erisman. They were out.
Fred Brunner, he didn’t want to get in at the beginning. Those were considered
some of the top criminal lawyers in the State of Texas.</p>

<p>So, anyhow, I meet him, they meet me at the plane in Los Angeles, get in the
car. The first thing they ask is “Have you got a lawyer?” And I tell them
what is going on. I am not sure yet. So they start talking to me about Belli,
Melvin Belli. I had never heard of him. And they couldn’t understand it. But
I never had. And I told them that, that I had never heard of him, and so they
start telling me how great he was, you know, and all that stuff.</p>

<p>And they said, “By coincidence he is in town. He is in L.A.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long before you arrived did Shore and Woodfield—how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
long before you arrived did they know you were coming? In other words, how
many days elapsed between your conversation with Shore and your airplane
trip out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Gee, only a day or so, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, had Shore mentioned Belli to you on the telephone in that
first conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I think so, but I am not sure—I think so, but I am not sure, because
I think in our conversation in the car that we had makes me think they mentioned
it before now, because the conversation went like this: I must have mentioned
before I haven’t heard of Belli. He says, “I know I haven’t mentioned Belli and
I don’t want to push him too much,” but then they started to tell me how good
he is, so we must have talked about him on the phone. My remark was, “But
Mike, I never heard of him.”</p>

<p>So, anyhow, they said, the conversation got around that he is in town, and,
“Would you care to see him?”</p>

<p>I says, “Well, I’ve got nothing to lose.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, they are telling me how great he is, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you under the impression that they had asked Belli to come
to Los Angeles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think it was a coincidence? Is there anything factual
that happened that might suggest to you <span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I think that they probably did. I shouldn’t say did, probably
could have. I don’t want to make the statement that they did, because Woodfield
later told me that Belli promised him that he would write Belli’s version of the
trial or whatever you call it, for making the contact to represent my brother,
words to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Woodfield said this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And you heard Woodfield say it or this is something that somebody
else told you Woodfield said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I heard Woodfield say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Woodfield told that to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did he tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That was later on when he learned—this was weeks later when he
learned he wasn’t going to do the story. Somebody else—Belli brought in a
fellow by the name of Al Moscow to do the story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The story of your brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The story of Belli?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Belli—Belli’s book on the trial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, was this <span class="locked">before——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Wait, we have got to clarify something else. We are getting ahead
of ourselves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me just pinpoint time here. Was your conversation with
Woodfield about Woodfield not being able to write the Belli story, did that conversation
occur before, during, or after the trial of your brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. During, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You indicate by your tone of voice and your words that you are
not certain as to when this took place. Could you try to think of what the
surrounding circumstances were of this conversation and other things to pinpoint
the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It wasn’t after, I know. Whether or not it was before, it could
have been just before, because I don’t remember when Al Moscow came down the
first time.</p>

<p>Oh, well, we can know exactly. It was published all over the country that
Belli had signed a contract to do a story on Jack Ruby and the trial and all that
stuff, and it was all over the country, with Al Moscow to do the writing. So we
can pinpoint that. I don’t remember the date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I took you off the track. Get back on your track.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Where was I?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You said that we were skipping ahead, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think the last thing you were talking about before we diverted
into these other aspects was that you said you had nothing to lose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; that is right, so that evening we went to see Belli.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you see Belli?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In a home—a used home he had recently purchased in L.A.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was an appointment made by them to see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; oh, yes. I think it was 7 o’clock, if I am not mistaken, that
evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did they call Belli? Where was Belli when they called
him to make the appointment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In L.A. from what they told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; but do you know whether he was at his house or in an
office or in a hotel or in a cocktail lounge or where he might have been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t recall. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you present when they called to make the appointment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t remember that, either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So we are at the point that you do go to see Belli.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think this is a good breaking point for lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Maybe.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 1:10 p.m., the proceeding was recessed.)</p>

<h3>TESTIMONY OF EARL RUBY RESUMED</h3>

<p>The proceeding reconvened at 2:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me state for the record that as we resume this deposition
that I presume you understand that the oath you took this morning with Mr.
Hubert and all the formalities which you went through still pertain to this
hearing.</p>

<p>You are still under oath and we will continue in the same fashion that we
did before.</p>

<p>If there are any questions about it why you are free to say anything.</p>

<p>We were talking, it seems to me, that we got you to the point where you had
just met Mr. Belli.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Belli, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, I wanted to confine your attention from here on in to
certain narrow aspects of your dealings in Los Angeles, and that is your efforts
to find financing for Jack’s trial and what the actual financing of the trial is.</p>

<p>Can you tell us, first of all, whether prior to seeing Belli, that day that you
were in Los Angeles, you talked to Mr. Shore and Mr. Woodfield at all about
the financing of the trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I told them we had to raise money, and I told them Howard
gave me a figure of anywhere from $25,000 to $50,000, and I asked them about
how much they thought they could obtain from a story, and they said they
couldn’t promise 50 but 30, 35, I think that was the figure that Woodfield used.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would that be the gross figure or would that be what your
brother would have ultimately had available from the entire sum for his defense?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That was the figure, the net figure my brother would have left
over after they took their commissions and percentage, and the agent’s fee and
all of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How many people were to share in the proceeds from the sale,
beside Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Woodfield, William Woodfield. Larry Shiller, the agent, and then
they in turn said they would pay commissions to sales people.</p>

<p>I don’t know who those were, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, this first day in Los <span class="locked">Angeles——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Prior to meeting Belli and your talk with them, did you discuss
how long the article or biography would be and where it would be published
and other details such as that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t think so; not the first day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, at the meeting at Mr. Belli’s house, did you discuss the
biography of your brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What discussion took place there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Just the general discussion that Woodfield would do the writing
of it. That is about all. And a figure did come up of how much could be raised
through the story, through the selling of the story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was the speculation at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That is what I said, you know, the same figure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long did your meeting at Mr. Belli’s home last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I would say at least an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much of the time at Mr. Belli’s house was spent discussing
the sale of the biography or the life story?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Probably 10 minutes altogether.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when you <span class="locked">finished——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Excuse me, would you want to know who else was present there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; I would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Sam Brody, one of his associates in L.A., another attorney, who was
in the case for a while but if you will recall he stepped out, and Woodfield’s wife,
yes, Woodfield’s wife, I don’t remember her <span class="locked">name——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Mike Shore there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No: I don’t think so. No; I am quite sure he wasn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When that meeting ended there, had there been an <span class="locked">agreement——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Excuse me a minute.</p>

<p>I am trying to think if Mike Shore was there. I don’t place him there. I am
not sure he was there. I can’t say yes or no to that question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He might have been there but you are not sure, is that your
answer, or is your original answer that he wasn’t there still your best impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. If my recollection is correct, I think he just met Belli and then
left. He had an appointment or something but I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was the conclusion of your talk at that point as to whether
Belli would represent Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It wasn’t definite yet. We talked about lawyers and he mentioned
what he thinks we ought to do, and psychiatrists we might need—and different
things that—he mentioned he would bring in Tonahill. He worked with Tonahill
before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that the first time Tonahill’s name was mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, did you remain in Los Angeles that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I think I was there that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you there the next day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I think I left the next—about noon of the next day if I am not
mistaken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you left Los Angeles what arrangements had been made
with respect to the autobiography or the life story of Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Nothing really definite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Woodfield ultimately write the story that you are talking
about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. <span class="locked">And——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He came down to Dallas later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was that published, that story? Just tell us generally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, they offered it for sale to foreign countries, publications in
foreign countries, and also here through the newspapers, through a sales organization
that handles that, I think, out of New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was that life story serialized in a number of newspapers throughout
the country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. When you say serialized, I don’t understand what you mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It was published over a period of days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did it appear in any national magazines?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; not in the United States. I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have some original discussion with Woodfield that it
would appear, that he would try to sell it to a national magazine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, our agreement was that he would sell it—yes, that if he could
sell it to a national magazine that he would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have any discussions with him about selling it to the
Saturday Evening Post?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did that discussion take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Not until later; probably down in Dallas when we met in Dallas
later on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much did the Ruby defense ultimately realize from that
newspaper article?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The net?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. A little over $30,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you people get—did the Ruby defense also get contributions
from people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; but very little, very little.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you tell us approximately what the total of the contributions
were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Contributions—are you speaking right up to today now or until
the trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Not until the exact day. But do you have some figure as to what
it was up to today? Roughly, what it is? I don’t ask you to be accurate to the
penny.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well now, you see there are two funds, the story fund and a separate
fund that a defense committee was trying to raise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, the story fund comprises the $30,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Separate; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there anything else in that fund besides the $30,000, or did
anything else go into it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I put in whatever donations my brother received in the jail
I deposited. It was only—I don’t think it was $500 from there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, other monies were given for the defense, though, were they
not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did they go into the defense committee fund? Did these other
monies go into the defense committee fund?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, they were used for paying the bills, if that is what you mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What I am trying to get at is, you say there are two funds, one
fund is what you call the newspaper <span class="locked">fund——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, you see, that—the newspaper—was more or less Jack Ruby’s
own fund. He authorized to write the story, and that was more or less his
own fund.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. But this is a separate committee that was set up in Chicago, and
they got several hundred dollars but we spent—well, on one ad we spent $200
for the ad and we got $205 back—to give you an idea. We kept using the money
hoping to get more money in but it didn’t work out too well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you tell us who the members of that defense committee are?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes. There is Michael Levin, a lawyer in Chicago, my brother
Hyman Ruby, Rubenstein, and Barney Ross, Marty Eritt.</p>

<p>Then there is another one or two in there that I am not too familiar with.
But they have got stationery. I don’t have it with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What efforts did they make to obtain funds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, they wrote some letters and they did advertising, as I told
you. However, quite a few of the—quite a few—most of the newspapers
wouldn’t take the ad. The Chicago papers wouldn’t take it. The Tribune, and
the Sun-Times in Chicago wouldn’t take an ad for an appeal for funds for Jack
Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you ever given any reasons?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; the answers were it is not their policy, and there was another
reason, I can’t remember the exact words. I don’t recall. But Mike Levin
did most of that, you know—the lawyer—he did most of the calling and he told
me, but I don’t remember the exact words and I would rather not say—you
know, if I am not sure of the exact words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don’t want you to say if you didn’t hear it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you keep the records for that defense committee fund?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; most—yes; I would say yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have those records here with you today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I gave them to an agent, though. I give them to an agent
some time ago. I gave him a list of all the monies that came in, and I think
I even gave him a list of who I paid it out to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is your best estimate of how much money came in altogether
in the defense committee fund?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Now you are not talking about the story—right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. From the defense committee fund between $1,500 and $2,000,
altogether.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What were the expenses of the fund or is this—excuse me—is
this $1,500 or $2,000—is that a net figure or a gross figure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That is a gross.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. After expenses, what was ultimately left for the
application to the defense?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I can’t give you an exact figure because I just can’t recall all of
the expenses we had, because I just paid a bill last week, and I just don’t have
it, but I would say we spent probably close to a thousand dollars, because one
ad alone was close to $300, and the letter was another $300—is $600 already that
I can think of. There were other, smaller expenses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know what the total expenses were that have been for
the defense of your brother so far?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In the low thirties. Of course, you must understand we are continually
spending money, so I don’t have it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you been given an estimate recently as to what the total
expenses of the defense of your brother is going to be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. An estimate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You mean if it goes to the Supreme Court and all that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; have you been given any estimate as to what the total
expenses might be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I would say no. Just said it would run into a lot of money
but no figure was ever actually quoted, except by Belli.</p>

<p>You see, he really didn’t, either. He just—I am trying to think what his statement
was, now. No; he didn’t either, because at that time we weren’t talking
about Supreme Court, we were only talking about—you know—the first trial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was <span class="locked">his——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He mentioned between $75,000 and $100,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. As a total cost.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Of the first trial. And that is now his fee and everything, when
you are talking expenses. I am talking everything they wanted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much of a fee did he quote to you at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He was talking about $50,000, if I recall correctly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he quote it to you personally or is this a figure you have
learned from somebody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; he quoted it to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now how <span class="locked">much——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In other words, it wasn’t a definite figure. He said it could be
around, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have the costs of the investigation for the defense been paid to
date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. What do you mean by investigations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did the defense hire investigators?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And have these investigators been paid for their work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Not completely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you <span class="locked">know——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, there is a difference of opinion <span class="locked">so——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you tell us how much has been paid and how much is claimed
as to the total bill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, the original investigator that we had, I think, we paid him
about $5,000 already, plus some expenses of a thousand dollars or so; I don’t
remember the exact figures, and he claims we owe him $1,500.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. More?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; and there is a little dispute about that.</p>

<p>Now, we have got a new investigator, I don’t know his name there. My
sister hired him down there and she has given him several hundred dollars, I
don’t know how much. I don’t know how much she gave him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Mr. Howard get any money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much was he paid?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I think we paid him, I am not sure of this figure though, $3,500.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And the remaining funds that have been paid, I take it, have been
paid to Mr. Belli?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Belli got, I think, $11,000, if I am not mistaken. Then we paid
the doctors, I don’t know, $5,000 or $6,000, you know, the psychiatrists that came
down, and some of my expenses came out, just my flight expenses and telephone
calls, and who else now?</p>

<p>We gave Burleson some money, he has got, I think, about a thousand dollars
that we gave him since the trial. He was supposed to get paid from Belli
before. That is the reason we didn’t pay him. However, he claimed Belli never
gave him anything. And we paid, like George Senator, the witness, our No. 1
witness, we had to give him money to live on because he was so, what shall I
say the word for that, well, he lost his job and he was so upset he couldn’t, you
know, he just couldn’t work.</p>

<p>And then we had to pay—he went home and I had to send him airplane fare
to come back, you know, and there <span class="locked">is——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about Larry Crafard, did you pay him any money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Larry Crafard, I think we just gave him a few dollars, $5 maybe
because he was broke when he was living on the road, he didn’t have a dime,
so I think I gave him some money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Larry incidentally contact you any time while you were in
Detroit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no; I wish he would have, because he hitchhiked all the way
down there, and I was driving at the same time, but he didn’t know I lived there,
and <span class="locked">we——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How was he notified to come to the trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know. If I remember correctly he came on his own. He
just thought that when all this came out about, you know, Jack getting him
to take that picture of Earl Warren, he had the camera or something, I forgot
the full details myself, but he is the one who took the picture, right, if I am not
mistaken, and he just thought he should come down to help Jack as much as
he possibly could.</p>

<p>Could I go a little further?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don’t really want to pry into this unless this is something you
care to reveal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The most important thing is coming up now, I mean one of the most
important things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. I do want to reflect this—that I don’t want to push
you into saying things, talking about subjects that you would rather not talk
about, and I realize that this in one of them. Now, if you do want to say something
about it why, of course, we would be happy to hear anything you want
to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I returned home, I went from L.A. to Dallas, I talked to
Jack, I talked to Howard. We hadn’t hired Belli yet. He was going to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
down and see Jack, and talk to him before he decided to come in, you know, and
take over the case.</p>

<p>I went back to Detroit and in a couple of days I get another call, I get a call,
from Woodfield. He is very upset. He just heard some news that he thinks
I must know. However, it is so confidential that he can’t even tell it to me over
the phone. And I talk to Mike Shore and between us—they couldn’t tell me
on the phone, I had better go back to California.</p>

<p>So, I go out there again. The story he tells me is that, in the meantime he
is trying to make contacts, this is about a week later. He is trying to make
contact to sell the story to the different publications, to the Saturday Evening
Post, you know, and other publications, and somebody from the Saturday
Evening Post called him, I think—now this is what he told me—and said that
Tom Howard was up to the Saturday Evening Post office in Dallas offering for
sale a picture of President Kennedy with a piece of his head shot off, and so I
immediately, or as soon as I could, when I left them, I called my sister Eva in
Dallas and I said, “Get a hold of the agent that has been talking—that has
been taking—your story there and tell them about this so they can check into
it.”</p>

<p>And then I went home, I flew back to Detroit.</p>

<p>By the time I got to Detroit they had tried to contact me to get some more
information on the story. I mentioned this to Tom Howard and he denied it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was his denial a flat denial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, yes; you know, complete, and you know. However, I think
it was the fellow at the Saturday Evening Post that said—now I have given all
this to the special agents or, I think, the Treasury Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The Saturday Evening Post man said, “Well, let them come in
front of me in my office and deny it.”</p>

<p>But, of course, we never brought it to a head. But, anyhow, I don’t know
what happened. They never told me, of course, as you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall the name of the Saturday Evening Post man in
Dallas that Howard allegedly contacted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I did originally but I think I gave it to the agents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk personally to this man from the Saturday Evening
Post who claims he talked to Howard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; Woodfield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Somebody—you just reported that somebody said—“Let Howard
come before me and deny it.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I take it this was the Saturday Evening Post man who allegedly
made that statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Let me look in my book. Perhaps I have it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What I am getting at is where did you get—who told you—that
the Saturday Evening Post man said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Woodfield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Woodfield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So everything you know about this transaction between Howard
and the Saturday Evening Post comes either from Woodfield or from Howard’s
denial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; right. I don’t have it. I may have it somewhere else in
another book but I don’t have it here.</p>

<p>By the way, if you are asking about the finances, we still have bills of—altogether
from what my sister tells me—of close to $10,000 that are unpaid now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is there any money left in either of the funds at this point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I have been putting it off.</p>

<p>I mean, Burleson insists he wants some money so I have been sending him out
of my personal account.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How soon after your brother shot Oswald did you see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I think it was about at least a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well——<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I am not sure. Because I made so many trips there. I was down
there about seven or eight times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it before you went to Los Angeles to see Mike Shore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I think I made it on the way back. I went to Los Angeles
first, the first trip, and then on the way back I went to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much time did you spend with Jack on this first visit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, they only let you talk about 20 minutes or a half hour at
the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When is the last time you have seen him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The last time I saw him was—I was there at the verdict, you
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you seen him since the verdict?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, oh, yes; I stayed there for at least several days, anyhow, and
I saw him every day at least once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Have you seen him since then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no; since I came back, since that trip, I haven’t been back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Did you notice any change in your brother’s mental
and physical condition between the first time that you saw him in Dallas and
the last time that you saw him in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes; definitely. Physically he lost about 30 pounds, and you
know, his face was drawn and his eyes sunken, and in addition to that he was
despondent, of course, and you couldn’t—he would have to repeat questions or
ask questions from him more than once to get a reply. It just didn’t seem to
register all the time.</p>

<p>Even Belli mentioned that he couldn’t get across to Jack all the time, and
Burleson mentioned to me several times that Jack is off his rocker. This was,
you <span class="locked">know——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this after the verdict or before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; before. He says, “Your brother is off his rocker. He has got
himself involved with all the Jews all over the world and he doesn’t know what
he is talking about,” but my brother did know what he was talking about. It
was Burleson who didn’t understand. Because in order to understand—it is a
Jewish problem—and most Jews would understand it.</p>

<p>Burleson, not being familiar with this, it just went over his head. I didn’t
even think of it then but he kept telling me, “Your brother has got himself all
mixed up with all the Jews all over the world and he is off his rocker.” That
was the statement he made several times to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I would like to explore this with you at some length if you don’t
mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That is why I brought this with me. I have all of this in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me try to ask you some questions first and then we will get
into the papers that you have brought. You say there was a disagreement, that
you disagreed with Burleson’s appraisal of your brother’s involvement with the
Jewish question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He couldn’t explain it. So, really, I didn’t understand it myself.
I didn’t know what he was talking about at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You subsequently did come to learn what he was talking about,
I take it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; it wasn’t until somebody brought it to my attention, really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was brought to your attention—what particular facts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, the fact it seemed that Jack in digging down into his past,
he had an obsession about the Jewish people, and he always went out of his way
to show people that Jews are not bad people, you know, because you know they
have been persecuted over the years, and that is one of the reasons he brought
the policemen at the station sandwiches and went out of his way to bring them
cheesecakes and he was in debt to me for thousands of dollars, yet he never sent
me any money but he always had money to give more or less or lend to these
other people, almost all non-Jews to show them that a Jew would help them out.</p>

<p>A policeman became a father and was short on money, he would lend him a
couple of hundred, never got it back, never got anything back.</p>

<p>Another friend he ran into needed a car to get a job—lent him a few hundred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know—can you give us the names of some of these
people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; but my sister has them down there. I don’t have it. But I
know of these instances, and he read all these books on the Jewish problem, the
persecution of the Jews, going all the way back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I know from my sister. He lived with my sister and she told me,
and he told me—both.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is this Eva?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Eva; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Jack has told you that he read books on the Jewish problems?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; he even went to lectures on it, the synagogue, they had movies
of the killings of the Jews in Germany. He went to all of these, things of that
sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I don’t know if Mr. Hubert has covered this or not, but do you
recall an episode or a period back before World War II when Jack showed
some concern about the Jewish problem, about the treatment of the Jews?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Before World War II?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You mean—well, he was in Chicago in the early thirties, they had
the Nazi Bund meetings and Jack was always one to go and see if he could help
break them up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you go on any of these groups?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. <span class="locked">Well——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He was about 4 years older than I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Over what period of time was Jack involved in trying to break
up these Bund meetings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In the early thirties there, I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember any other people who participated with him
in those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I don’t know their names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was this a group of people or would Jack go alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no; it was a group. But I don’t know the other names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was it any sort of organized group? Was there an organization
that he belonged to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I don’t think it was an organization. It just was several
Jewish fellows and I don’t think they had an organization of any kind. Just
when they learned that meetings were taking place, they would go there and
try to break them up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Jack ever arrested in connection with any of those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Not as far as I know, because he has no arrest along those lines
at all.</p>

<p>In fact, the only violation he has, from what I could gather, was being open
after hours, and carrying concealed weapons which, from what I understand,
they don’t need a permit in Dallas, you know, when he carried large sums of
money.</p>

<p>Other than that—you must understand I was away from him, practically
from the time he went to Dallas until the incident. I only saw him for short
periods of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever hear of the Dave Miller gang?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was the Dave Miller gang?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I read about them in the paper. I was just a school kid
then, but that was a gang that hung around Dave Miller’s fight gymnasium,
that is all I can remember. But I know something like that existed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did they get newspaper publicity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack have anything to do with those people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He used to hang around Dave Miller’s gym but he was Barney
Ross’ follower like, and I think Barney Ross trained there and so he was very
close with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well now, this group that was referred to as the Dave Miller
gang.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Dave Miller was a referee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Dave Miller was a referee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; Davy Miller was a referee in Chicago for many years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And he ran a gymnasium?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; to train the fighters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And did Dave Miller have a following of some sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I would say it was—there was a restaurant downstairs and
it was a hangout. He owned the restaurant and the gym, and he was a referee
so the fighters hung around there and other people came around to see the
fighters, so it was a general hangout for people of that type.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did the Dave Miller gang have anything to do with these
efforts to break up the Bund meetings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I think so, but I don’t have any concrete evidence. I think they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you go ahead and tell us—let me ask you this, rather.
You say that your awareness of your brother’s, what we’ll call involvement with
his Jewish background or his position in society as a person of Jewish background,
was brought to your attention by someone else. Who brought this to
your attention?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; what was brought to my attention, I knew he was also interested
in the Jewish problem, but I didn’t think it entered into this picture
because I didn’t—this article here that was drawn up by Sol Dann, who through
his daughter, a friend of the family, became interested in it because he could
see what was in the background, and he studied all the things and he got some
information from me and he talked to my brother, my sister and the psychiatrists
on the case, and the more he talked to them the more he could see
that this was an obsession with my brother, who probably didn’t realize it
was as great an obsession as it actually was, and that is probably one of the
reasons why Belli mentioned to me on a few occasions, “I can’t get across to
your brother. I don’t have a client.”</p>

<p>He says, “I have a patient, not a client.”</p>

<p>He mentioned that to me several times. He says, “I can’t get through to
your brother.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he give any specific indications?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I didn’t go any further either, because I thought Belli was
such a great lawyer. I say—I don’t even remember what I said, I just—then
he had psychiatrists, when the psychiatrist would interview my brother he
would talk to him afterward, and if ever I asked, I mean, what they say, he
says, “Well, they claim he is sick, he has got this”—I don’t know the medical
terms he used, you know, and so on and so forth, and, “We have a good case,
he is definitely sick,” and all that, but the real problem. I mean the obsession
itself, I don’t think that even registered with Belli or the other psychiatrists,
because as far as I know—because it was never mentioned at the trial, and
the psychiatrists never mentioned it to us, and we didn’t think to tell it to
them, because we didn’t know if it had any importance or not, but we find
now in talking to the psychiatrists that it is of great importance and it was
probably one of the factors in his thinking the way he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What about Mr. Burleson—did he tell you during this period,
when you didn’t understand what he was talking about—what did he tell
you about Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, he was aloof from us. That was the big problem with that
trial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me say, Mr. Ruby, I don’t want to, I am not asking you
to comment on the way Mr. Burleson conducted himself, but I am trying to
find out what it was he said to you about Jack which you didn’t comprehend
at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He said he is getting himself involved with all the Jews all over
the world on an international scale—“He is off his rocker”—that was one
of <span class="locked">his——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he specify any of the things Jack was talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; he used to say, “Jews all over the world, on an international<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
scale,” that was his expression several times and then, of course, he stated,
“He is off his rocker.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Mr. Burleson tell you this sort of thing before the trial,
or only after the trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Before and during, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. And not so much after, because after we were disgusted, I will tell
you that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long before the trial did Mr. Burleson begin to call these
problems about involvement with Jews.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right after he got involved. Because he lived in Dallas, and he
talked to my brother more so than anyone else because he lives there and right
after he got into the case, not a few days later, he says, you know, made the
statement again, “That your brother has got himself involved with all the
Jews on an international scale and he is off his rocker, he doesn’t know what he
is talking about.”</p>

<p>And to be truthful to you I didn’t understand his statement. It didn’t register
with me because they kept saying, Belli said, “Your brother is sick. I have got
a patient on my hands, you know. I am trying to take care of your brother,
and I can’t get across to him.”</p>

<p>And my brother, I know, he had many fights because of the Jewish question,
of being called, you know, names, referring to his Jewish parents and all that
stuff, and, of course, I have been through it myself but he more so, and he fought
more about it.</p>

<p>He was always quick tempered and just couldn’t take it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What other fights did he get involved in because of the Jewish
question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Many fights. I know on several occasions he came home once with
his suit full of blood from downtown.</p>

<p>He was downtown Chicago. I said, “What happened?”</p>

<p>He said, “Somebody called me a dirty Jew or something like that.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know who he fought with on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no; there are many instances that my older brothers and sisters
know of because I was younger, 4 years younger and in his teens, early teens, I
didn’t go with him because 4 years makes a big difference, and I went my way
and he went his way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How old was Jack at the time that you saw him with this suit
full of blood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. This goes back now, if I recall in 1946, I think, 1946.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This was after he got out of the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, yes; he told me he had several fights in the service regarding
this. He told me he had fights with a professional heavyweight in the service
because he said something about the Jews.</p>

<p>My brother was so Jewish conscious that it didn’t make any difference whether
he said, swore at him for being a Jew or he swore at somebody else a half a
block away. He would get in there and fight right away, you know, unless
they apologized and what have you. And he—so this, checking into it from what
the psychiatrists tell me, he went out of his way to show the gentiles that in
their thinking that all the Jews are no good or money grabbers or what have
you, here was a nice guy that went out of his way—and didn’t have the money—to
help anybody he could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any examples of this from the period that you
worked with him at Earl Products?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, <span class="locked">this——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let’s just focus on that for a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He was with me only a short period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What examples do you have from that period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I know from Earl Products is when he had that fight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That I know of. Other instances, I can’t think of because as I said
he went around with an older group of fellows than I did. We didn’t run around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
together. And not only that, I was married then, and you know he has been a
bachelor all his life so he went to <span class="locked">places——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You traveled with him, didn’t you in the early forties you traveled
with Jack, didn’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, look back on that experience, if you can, do you remember
any episodes from that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Actually, you must understand I didn’t travel with him. I only
met him every weekend. He traveled by himself, and I traveled by myself, and
we got together on weekends and then we would only see each other Friday
night and then he would go on.</p>

<p>And we traveled through the East mostly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Mr. Ruby, you have brought certain papers with you, and Mr.
Hubert is now in the room, and I want to bring him up to date a little bit on
where we are, and we have been talking sometime about your brother’s obsession,
as I think you call it, with his position in society as a person of Jewish background,
and you indicated to me that you really only fully became aware of this
problem since your brother shot Oswald, but that you have thought about it
considerably since then, and that you have brought with you certain papers in
connection with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I wonder first if you can first identify a paper in your hand,
if you will identify that paper, and I will give it an exhibit number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. What would you call <span class="locked">this——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You are handing <span class="locked">me——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. This document.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. A document that consists of 30 typewritten pages purporting
to have been prepared by a man named Sol Dann, 1820 David Stott Building,
Detroit 26, Mich. This is a Xerox copy and on the first page I am going to
write your name “Earl Ruby Deposition, June 3, 1964, Exhibit No. 1” and I will
ask you if you will state for the record what that is.</p>

<p>(Earl Ruby Exhibit No. 1 was marked for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, this I would like to get into the record if I can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is Exhibit No. 1 and then I will mark this other thing
that you gave me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. This is only what I want to state.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Exhibit No. 1, tell us what that is. In a general fashion tell us
what that consists of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, this is as was stated, prepared by Mr. Dann as to why or
one of the reasons, that Ruby, that is Jack Ruby, shot Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Now, you have also handed me a handwritten penciled
set of papers consisting of three pages.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I was going to read that, is that all right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That was my intention if it is all right with you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have a statement you would like to make for the
record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, go ahead then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I am filing this document with you because it explains why I need
the help of the United States, and more especially, your help.</p>

<p>My brother, Jack, was deprived, and is presently being deprived, of his
constitutional and civil rights. The hatred and bigotry in Dallas, Tex., resulted
in the assassination of our President. It almost cost the lives of our present
President, Mr. Johnson, and others.</p>

<p>With all the protection that this Government could give it could not guard
against and prevent the assassination.</p>

<p>My family and myself are unable to cope with that situation and it may result
in my brother’s death.</p>

<p>As pointed out in this document, my brother, Jack, is being made the scapegoat
of this horrible situation. I, therefore, need, and respectfully request, your
assistance in order that those guilty of this atrocity, either because of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
acts or omission, gross negligence, or commission shall not go unpunished or
undisciplined.</p>

<p>I don’t think that my brother, who had nothing to do with the assassination
of the President, should be the only one punished. My family as well as myself
have almost exhausted all of our resources in an effort to protect my brother’s
civil rights, but now I am calling upon you for the help we need.</p>

<p>That is it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I suggest you put the document in the record as well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you mind, Mr. Ruby, if we would put that in the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; this I didn’t use.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I will mark the three pages from what you have just read.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I have marked them “Earl Ruby Deposition, June 3, 1964, Exhibit
No. 2,” and that is on the first page. I think on the second page I will
write Exhibit No. 2, and on the third page I will write Exhibit No. 2.</p>

<p>I will ask you if we may keep this and include this as part of our permanent
record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me hand you Exhibit No. 2 and ask you if you will sign it on
the first page and initial each of the other pages.</p>

<p>(Earl Ruby Exhibit No. 2 was marked for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Ruby, may I ask, this is addressed to whom, this Exhibit
No. 2, which you actually read into the record. Who are you addressing it to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. To the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To the Commission. It is your desire that we see that the
members of the Commission receive that document, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is to say both your letter and the attachment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; both.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I notice that Exhibit No. 1 which is the long one of 30 pages, has
the name Sol Dann.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Sol Dann.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I also notice he didn’t sign it. Did he actually prepare it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you read it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you concur in what he says then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there any reason why he didn’t sign it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I didn’t even notice it, to be honest with you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask Mr. Ruby, I will hand him back Exhibit No. 1, and
ask you if you will simply sign that on the first page, so we may have it properly
marked for the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me ask you about Exhibit No. 2. This is in pencil?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I didn’t think that you would want it so I, of course, <span class="locked">didn’t——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you write this Exhibit No. 2?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yesterday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It is your own handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>I will have photostats made of this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. If it doesn’t take, I can rewrite it in ink in 5 or 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you some questions to get the background of this
document which we have marked here as Exhibit No. 1.</p>

<p>First of all, would you tell us how you happened to know Mr. Dann?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. His daughter teaches Hebrew in the school where my daughter
attends, and his daughter impressed on him, after several conversations to contact
me, and see what he could do to help us because he has been very active in helping
I should say, the minority groups of any organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you tell us what Mr. Dann does for a living?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He is an attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In Detroit?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How old a man is Mr. Dann?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I would say 55. That is a guess, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know Mr. Dann before his daughter talked with you
<span class="locked">about——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. His daughter didn’t talk with me. She talked with him and finally
convinced him to contact me and see what he could do to help us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did Mr. Dann first contact you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Shortly after the verdict was passed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, do you know what efforts Mr. Dann made after talking with
you, to talk with other people in order to prepare this document?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; he talked with many other people, the psychiatrists, he talked
with Dr. West. He talked with Dr. Smith, the chief counsel, he talked, with Mr.
Charles Bellows, the consultant on the case.</p>

<p>He talked to a psychiatrist by the name of Tanay in Detroit, and he mentioned
several other people but I don’t recall their names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can <span class="locked">you——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Excuse me; he also talked to my brother in Dallas, Sam.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you say he talked with your brother Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; he talked to Eva. But he talked to Dr. West and Dr. Smith
and Bellows who spent a lot of time with Jack, of course, altogether.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You indicated to Mr. Hubert that this Exhibit No. 1 had been
read by you and that it generally reflected your views.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you tell us in your own words generally what is set forth in
Exhibit No. 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, it goes into, it explains Jack’s thinking along the Jewish
problem, and his obsession and his love of President Kennedy, his going out of the
way to try to be an exceptionally good guy by helping gentiles as much as he
possibly could, and in any way he could. It also explains happenings at the trial.
The withholding of evidence by District Attorney Henry Wade that should have
been presented to the court. That my brother had received psychiatric help
when he was 10 years old and none of the family knew it except the FBI, who
had turned this information over to Wade.</p>

<p>However, Wade never permitted this to be used at the trial, and it also goes
into telling of many cases that were reversed because of incidents similar to
those which took place at my brother Jack’s trial, and states for these many
reasons that the verdict should be reversed for all of these mistakes or negligence
or whatever you may call it on the part of the court and the State’s attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is it correct, do I have the correct understanding then, that in a
sense we can break this down into two parts: One part of the document deals
with the facts that have to do with Jack’s obsession?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And the other part has to do with the legal errors in the trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; right—correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me direct myself to some of the factual issues that are raised
by Exhibit No. 1. I have made some notes here as you have been talking, and
I want you, after we cover this, to tell me if I have left anything out that you
think is important, but I want to try to cover this in orderly fashion. I am
going backward though.</p>

<p>One issue that you raised here was that District Attorney Wade had withheld
certain psychiatric evidence at the trial that had been turned over to him by
the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. By the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And that was that your brother Jack had received psychiatric
help at age 10 and none of the family members knew about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you to tell us what your present understanding is
now as to how Jack happened to get this psychiatric treatment, and where it
was administered, and for how long, and the other details?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know that but the FBI gave that information to Wade,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
and Tonahill has that information in Dallas but I don’t have the exact dates.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, do you know where he got the psychiatric aid?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know what institution?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You say Tonahill has this information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know how this evidence happened to be given, or let me
ask you this, how do you know this evidence was given by the FBI to Mr. Wade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Tonahill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Tonahill has told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; that it was given to Wade by the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did Tonahill learn about this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did <span class="locked">Tonahill——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, he handled all the contacts with the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Tonahill did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; more or less.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It is your understanding that the work of the trial team was
divided up in such a way that only Tonahill dealt with the FBI, for the most
part?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; as far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, so you have no personal information, further personal
information, at this time about this psychiatric help which Jack got at age 10?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When Jack was 10 was he living in the home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In a foster home, yes; so far as I can understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, that would have made you 6, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Would have made me 6.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where were you living at age 6?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. To tell you the truth, I don’t know but I think I was living in
Chicago, of course, and I don’t remember the name. I think the name of the
people were Speeves, but I don’t know if I went to the farm, they sent me to a
farm for a year, whether I was on a farm at the time but anyhow we weren’t
together those years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. For how many years were you separated from the rest of the
family as a child?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. To tell you the truth, I don’t know when it started. I would say
5, 6 years maybe. I was in three foster homes that I remember all together. I
know I was on a farm, and then at two foster homes that I can distinctly
remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember how old you were when you returned to the
home of your family, your mother’s and father’s home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I think it was in 1928, 1928, so I must have been 13 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And that would have made Jack 17.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Seventeen; I am not sure whether it was—I just don’t remember.
It has got to be a little before that. Because I went to that Shepherd School
for a few years, it had to be there from 1925 to 1928, but I don’t know exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you living in the home when you went to the Shepherd
School?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You mean was I living with the family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Jack living with the family at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; that is when we were all brought back together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Had Jack finished high school at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no; Jack didn’t finish high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. No; but was Jack still attending school when he returned to
the home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you able to recall how long Jack continued to attend school
after you returned to the family, to your family?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I know he graduated from that Shepherd School but when I
don’t know. As far as I know he graduated from that school and then he went
to Marshall High School for a while and then he dropped out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Another thing that you mentioned that we were discussing in
Exhibit 1, that Mr. Dann had assembled some facts and had discussed Jack’s
efforts to show that the Jews are good people by himself helping gentiles.</p>

<p>Now I want you to go back and comb your recollection of the period you lived
with and worked with Jack for incidents when you can recall of your own knowledge
of Jack helping gentiles, or helping people in general, let’s not limit it to
Jews or gentiles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, even when we were in business, we had that problem which
came up several times, where he would take some of the merchandise, like our
pens that we were using, and salt and pepper shakers, and almost every day or
two he would take a load of samples. When I asked him he would say, “Well,
a nice guy here or there and I gave him one or two, what difference does it make”,
in the meantime he was giving them out all the time. If anybody wanted one
he would just give it to them. But at that time no remark was made as far as
I can remember as to why he did it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you be able to give us names of any people who, you
know might have been the beneficiaries of this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I wouldn’t remember, because I wouldn’t know where, but most of
this took place or a great part of it anyhow in Dallas, and the names of those
I think we could get.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about as far as you are concerned, of course, you knew him
in Chicago, how about people that you can think of that Jack would have extended
these kindnesses to in Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I couldn’t remember any names because there was no reason to
remember this, and this goes back so far. It is 20 years at the earliest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, you also mentioned that your brother had a great love for
President Kennedy. Can you give us some examples of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I didn’t realize it, I mean, because I haven’t been with him
since the Kennedy family and Kennedy himself, to really become involved in
politics because he was in Dallas and I was in Chicago and in Detroit. However,
I know that when they, I think it was the Dallas Morning News printed that full
page, whatever you call that, <span class="locked">statement——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The black bordered advertising?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; the black bordered advertising which more or less definitely
insulted the President, he went to the paper and asked them if they needed the
money so bad that they had to print such a horrible thing even though the other
paper had turned it down.</p>

<p>And I think you know he was so upset about seeing that sign on the roadside
about “Impeach Earl Warren” that in the middle of the night he got his roommate
out and got Jerry Crafard, I think his name was, to take a picture of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know why he was upset about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, he couldn’t see why anything like that could happen. Here
is another great man, and he just couldn’t understand it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you surmising this or <span class="locked">did——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I talked to George Senator who was his roommate, he said
he was infuriated that a sign like that should be put up. And that was brought
out in the trial, of course, and proved.</p>

<p>Then he on the night of the assassination, or rather on the afternoon he immediately
closed the club, and when he was asked if he—what about the other
night club owners because there is another, I think one or two clubs on the same
block as his, yes, there are two more, whether they are going to close or not, in
a statement he made, he doesn’t care if they close or not, he is going to be closed
in respect to the President.</p>

<p>Then he went to the services at the synagogue in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know how long he was at that service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know how long, but I know that he broke down terribly there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you talk to anybody <span class="locked">who——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I heard it from the Rabbi who was there, that he was—of course,
most of the people there were broken up but he was most unusual because he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
in deep tears, he really was. And he was so upset and so disgusted with this
situation that he called my sister Eileen in Chicago and told her this is a good
time to get out of Dallas. He is ashamed of it, that this thing could happen
there, and he will probably—he wants to come up to Chicago for a few days, you
know, to visit with her. Well, she discouraged him from coming up. He wanted
to come to Chicago, and he also called my brother Hy in Chicago after the
assassination, and told him how terrible it was, and he thinks he is going to get
out of Dallas, he is coming back to Chicago altogether.</p>

<p>He also called his good friend, this was all brought out in the trial, not all of
it but most of it, although those last two incidents about him calling my brother
and my sister were never entered into evidence. We couldn’t understand that.</p>

<p>He also called a fellow in California, Al Gruber, I think is his name, and
Gruber said he just couldn’t talk. He just couldn’t talk he was so broken up.</p>

<p>So we know he was really broken up, and he must have really loved him because
otherwise you just don’t do these things. And the fact that he went to
the newspaper and complained to them for even taking the ad, and I mean nobody
else did this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any examples of his conduct in Dallas before the
President was shot that would show his feeling toward President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; We don’t have—nothing that I know of. We don’t have
anything that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I wonder if you can give us some more examples <span class="locked">of——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. There is a bit about his patriotism that might mean something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. This happened many years ago. They were playing the Star
Spangled Banner in the stadium in Chicago before all sporting events, and a
friend who was with him, a fellow by the name of Mr. Kolitz told me this
himself, he was smoking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What is Mr. Kolitz’s first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Ira. He was smoking when the Star Spangled Banner was playing
and my brother insisted he put out his cigarette, that it wasn’t in good taste
to be smoking when the Star Spangled Banner was being played.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Your brother didn’t approve of smoking either, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; he didn’t smoke at all. Well, neither do I, for that matter.
But this I didn’t find out about until a couple of months ago because I ran
into this party in Chicago, and you know talking about these things, and he
says, “How could they accuse your brother of being a Communist”, and then
he related this incident to me. He says, “I remember, you know at the stadium
when this happened, and he actually insisted I put the cigarette out.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack in your dealings with him, did he strive to be important
and did he strive for recognition, things like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I would say, well, he tried to be a success. He always wanted
to be a success in life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was his idea of being a success?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, having a family and being happily married and earning a
steady living.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he talk to you about his desires to have a family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes; on a few occasions. Once when he had financial failure
and he was terribly depressed back in the early fifties, I think, he came to
Chicago. He was just terribly depressed and he says, “Well, it looks like it is
the end for me.” And, you know, he had no—he was penniless, and I tried
to help him out again there. I was trying to look around for a business for
him, to be truthful with you because we were doing pretty well, making a
living, a good living, and I thought I could help him out but he decided to go
back to Dallas again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well now, there have been reports that Jack was the kind of
a person who liked, who wanted everybody to know him and liked to be a big
shot, some people might say. Did you have any experiences with him that
would indicate anything about those kind of observations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, he was pretty well known in Chicago. He always was a
good athlete, a good ballplayer. He was a very great swimmer, and he was
very close to Barney Ross, so I would say—and he had many friends, so he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
was pretty well liked, and maybe some people would get the impression that he
was a big shot but actually I don’t think he ever went out of the way to try to
show people he was a big shot.</p>

<p>However, maybe I didn’t notice it because I am his brother. And he was my
older brother, and so maybe I just didn’t notice it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I wonder if you can explain what seems to be on the one hand
signs of his obsessions about being a Jew, such as you pointed out as fighting
the Bundists and things like that, and on the other hand, what appears to be
a lack of regular devotion to going to church services every week and keeping
the religious home, and so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, the reason for that is I am more or less the same way as
I explained before because in the breaking up of our home we were drawn
away from this life, you see. I was living with—on a farm—I was living with
gentile people and there wasn’t any synagogue there to go to, and so we drifted
away from the services. And because before that we used to go to the Hebrew
school, before our home was broken up, we all went to Hebrew school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you learn Hebrew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, sure. Jack and—we went only until our home was broken up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you were living in your home, did your parents keep a
kosher home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes; definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It was a kosher home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes; definitely. Oh, sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. To what extent was it a kosher home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. We would call it orthodox, you know, change of dishes and all
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Dietary rules?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Sure; that is right. Sure, sure. But, of course, when <span class="locked">we——</span></p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What language was spoken in the home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. To our parents Yiddish, you would call it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did your parents speak English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Very little; very few words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are you willing to make this statement that your conversations
with your parents were always in Yiddish?</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no; I can’t say that because my father spoke a little English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about with your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. My mother I would say in her conversations she threw in a word
here or there in English; about 95 percent was Yiddish. My father picked up
more English words because, in fact, he was working as a carpenter, and being
out among English-speaking people more than, more so than my mother who
was home all the time, he had an opportunity to learn some English words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when the children got older, the family continued to live
together, as I understand it, there was a home where all of the unmarried
children and the parents lived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In that home up until the time that your mother died, did you
observe, were the dietary practices observed all the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes; sure. Every Passover we changed the dishes, and so on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; but that is just once a year. What about on a daily basis,
did you observe every day the <span class="locked">dietary——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, you don’t observe it every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, some homes do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Some homes keep separate dishes for meat and dairy products.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; we had separate dishes until my mother passed away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How about the regularity of attending church services, temple
services, did you go every week to temple services?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no; not all of us. I know I didn’t. My sisters did. My sister
did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Which sister?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Marion. My father did until he became ill, you know, and then
he passed away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there any resentment in the home toward the practices that
were maintained by your parents there, failure to converse regularly in English
and perhaps their old world habits?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Which is common in all families, I think, in which the practices
that are observed in the home are not the kind of practices that you see on
television or in the movies. Was there resentment among any of the children
toward the fact that here was a home in which a foreign language was spoken,
and practices were observed which did not appear to be the same practices as
the people who were on top in American society?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I would say so. However, my mother insisted that we follow
the lines of the Orthodox Jew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did any of you object to that insistence by your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; nothing because there wasn’t too much to object to, because
it was the same food. I mean there is really nothing—however, if we would
take the wrong utensil, you know, because there are two separate ones, we would
be bawled out for taking the wrong one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Well, Jack during the time that he was in Chicago lived for
various periods outside the home, didn’t he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. For example, I believe he lived with either Sam Gordon or Alex
Gruber in a separate apartment in Chicago in the early thirties. Do you recall
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I know he lived with Gruber but I don’t know how long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. <span class="locked">Well——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Because it was in the early thirties, I was going to high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was there any particular reason why Jack did not want to live
with the family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. None that I can remember. There may have been, but I may not
be, you know, I wasn’t aware of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He also was away from Chicago from about 1933 to 1937.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I think he went to ’Frisco to work there; yes. I think he
went there. I think my sister was there or he went first, I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know his friend Leon Cooke?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Leon Cooke of Jewish background?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you familiar with Jack’s activities with Leon Cooke in
the labor union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. A little bit. I think I <span class="locked">knew——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What can you tell us about that, what—how long did Jack work
in the union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I know as far as I know, I think he helped organize it. It
was Leon Cooke’s idea. Leon Cooke was an attorney and his father, Mr. Cooke,
was a scrap iron and junk handler, and for some reason or another of his own
thinking he decided that it would be a good idea to organize a union because
the—although he was doing very well as an attorney without it, the workers in
this industry were being paid, I think at that time, 10 cents or 15 cents an hour,
and it was actually slave wages practically, as you can easily understand, and
so they organized the union or how they go about it I don’t even know, but they
did, Leon Cooke and Jack helped organize it, but I think Leon did all the legal
work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know of anybody else who helped in the organizing
efforts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Even I went out once to hand out those flyers, you know, “join
the union.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did you hand them out and what would you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, they would come out from work and I would just hand it to
them, as they leave the plant, just hand it to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever make any personal contacts with members, with
employees?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; never. I just——<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were there any other people that you know of who worked in
the union with Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I think my brother Hy worked for a little while in the union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Sam work in the union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t think so. I only went there on very rare occasions, very
rare. I may have been to one or two meetings in all. I didn’t get paid for it
either, just, you know, kicks just to hand out the flyers, that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you think of any other people who were involved in the
union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I know John Martin, he was the president.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He is the fellow who was killed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; he shot Leon Cooke.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He shot Leon Cooke. Is John Martin still living?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know. I know there was another fellow but I can’t think
of his name. There was a fellow by the name—I can’t think of their names.
They had odd names. Of course, that goes back in the thirties, I think, right
in there somewhere. I don’t even remember where it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was Leon Cooke a fellow about your brother’s age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So Jack would have been in the late twenties at the time that
he and Leon formed the union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know. I don’t know what year it was even. I don’t even
remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. It was in the late thirties, wasn’t it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know. I really don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you know of any girls that Jack dated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Offhand not even one because he was, as I said, 4 years older
than I was and we didn’t run around together. I know of the one he went
with in Dallas, which was, I think she was—I don’t know if she testified at the
trial or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is Alice Nichols?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Alice Nichols.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. She is not a Jewish girl, is she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did it seem to be Jack’s practice to get interested in women
who are, what do you call them, shiksas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I really don’t know because I don’t know too much. You
see he traveled in a different—I am trying to think. When he was going
to Marshall High School that is when you usually start going with girls. I
don’t recall those days because I was too young.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What I am interested in exploring with you, if you can in a
somewhat objective fashion, is some of the contrast between evidence you
have shown us with his obsession with the fact that he was a Jew, and other
indications that, for example, his dating girls who were gentiles and his living
outside of the home away from the Jewish practices which might indicate
that he had some desire to escape his Jewish background. Did you see any
evidence of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; that I wouldn’t—because believe it or not, when my mother
passed away and also my father, you know, we have to go say services, we
are supposed to say services for a year every day and I didn’t keep it up, but he
did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Jack went to services after <span class="locked">your——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Mother died.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Every day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Every day as far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where was this temple that he attended services at?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, there was one, I know, <span class="locked">up——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were these temples in Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. One was in Chicago, I can’t think of the name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Your mother died while Jack was still in Chicago. When was
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. 1944.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Jack was in the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did you know he did that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He told us he went to services. You can say services there too as
long as the <span class="locked">chaplain——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would he have to go before a rabbi or chaplain of some sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Really not necessarily; it is not—because they say if it isn’t
available, you can still say the prayer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This could be something he could have done on his bunk, his
cot in the Army?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know. There he had access to a chaplain though because
it wasn’t a large camp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. When I say you don’t have access, I am thinking of overseas
where it might be a small unit, like where I was there wasn’t a Jewish chaplain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What I am trying to get at is this occurred while he was in the
service. In order for him to properly observe mourning for your mother would
he have had to have done something so that somebody else would have to be
aware he was doing this other than Jack simply telling them. Would he have
done something in his area where he lived or light a candle or would he have gone
to a chaplain or gone in some place and prayed where people could have seen
him. What would there have been observed by other people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know. How can I answer that. I wasn’t with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But you know what the requirements are of the Jewish faith
to properly observe mourning for people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What would some of the things have been that Jack would have
had to have done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Just say the prayer, to read it out of the book or if you know it
from memory, by that time after a while you know it from memory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And he could have repeated that to himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It is possible. But if a rabbi or services are available that is where
you usually go. But if you are at a remote place where it isn’t possible to have
services then you can say it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you actually recall Jack telling you that he was going to
services for your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did he tell you that he went?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He just said he was carrying on the services but I don’t remember
now. This happened 20 years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What I am trying to get at is your not saying that you recall
him telling you he went to a chapel or to a synagogue or a temple.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; all he said was that he said services.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. But as to where I didn’t think it was at that time necessary to
question him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are there any other examples of this concern with his religious
heritage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I told you about he read all the books or as many books as
he could on the Jewish atrocities, whatever you might call them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He did this down in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He did this in Dallas that I know, my sister told me. In fact,
when I went there he had several books.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What kind, do you remember the names of the books?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He had one called “Eva” and “Exodus”, and another one there that
he was reading, and then he would give them away after he finished. I can’t
think of the other one. It was still there while I was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When was this that you observed “Eva” and “Exodus”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right after the incident I went down there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I see. So after the incident he was reading “Eva” and
“Exodus”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no; it was before. I saw the books after but he had been
reading them before because they were in my sister’s apartment. She had taken
everything from his apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. So it is your understanding that he had certain religious type
books?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Books on Jews in the apartment that he was living in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right; definitely. In fact, he went out of his way as I stated
before, to go and listen to lectures at the synagogue on the Jewish problem and
the atrocities in Germany, and they showed films, real detailed films on what
actually took place and he made it a point to be there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When did this occur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. This happened before the incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How long before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know. I don’t know. But my brother Sam told me about
this just last week that when his mother-in-law, his wife’s mother, was down
in Dallas, Jack insisted she come along to see these films and hear the lecture.</p>

<p>You see, as I said, I have to get these, some of these things through a third
party because I am in Detroit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Sure, sure. I want to get them straight as to where you got them
so we can follow them out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall, this is on another subject, that at one time when
you were questioned about why Jack and you had a falling out with respect
to Earl Products, that you stated that Jack was not spending full time on the
business, and that was one of the reasons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, we didn’t think so. This was Sam’s and my opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Can you tell us what was happening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, we wanted him to sell our products that we were manufacturing,
and he was, seemed to be always getting involved with selling somebody
else’s product. Of course, there was a commission involved or whatever
it was, but I didn’t—we didn’t approve of it. We wanted to push our products
and so, of course, he and Sam had a real runout or whatever you call it and
then we finally decided to buy him out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What other products was he selling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I think he was selling costume jewelry. Well, we don’t
manufacture that. We wanted him to devote his entire interest into the
company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would costume jewelry, could it be considered a companion
line for anything you were selling. Would he go into the same stores to sell
costume jewelry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You possibly could, you possibly could, but it was our opinion
that he should devote all of his time to our products.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What was Jack’s responsibility in Earl Products?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He was actually the sales manager.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he have employees working in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I was just going to add, he didn’t have any, he was the only one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. He managed himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; and he was a good salesman, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did <span class="locked">this——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Anyhow, with leading too we weren’t hitting it off so good, and
my sister Eva was asking him to come down to Dallas, so between everything
we finally decided to buy him out and he took his money and went down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did his sales activities require him to spend most of his time
outside of the place of business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Of course; oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much of your sales were on a mail-order basis and how
much was this direct selling that Jack may have been involved in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, at this time, the time he was handling the sales, there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
very little mail order. It was mostly accounts that he had secured or we had
in one way or another.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Like Mar-Din.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That was in St. Louis, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no; in Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. In Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he travel outside the Chicago area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Not too much; not too much, if I recall. I don’t recall. I don’t
think he traveled too much.</p>

<p>I think, now that I think of it, that was one of our problems. We wanted
him to go down or go out of town, to Milwaukee or any of the other cities,
even close by, and definitely St. Louis where we eventually sold Katz Drug
which is a big and good account for us and they turned out to be a pretty fair
account. And anyhow as I said one thing led to another. Eva was wanting
him in Dallas and he wasn’t getting along too well with us so it was decided
to buy him out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. The only other topic I want to cover with you now is the circumstances
behind you changing your name from Rubenstein to Ruby. Did
Mr. Hubert cover that with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Sort of. Well, first off, there are two reasons. First of all,
we were, I think, very conscious of the Jewish name of Rubenstein, and we
had worked for another Jewish fellow who we all looked up to, an elderly
fellow who had been very successful in business and his name was Stanley
Eisenberg and he said, “When you send out mail orders you shouldn’t use a
Jewish name because of the—some people won’t order even if they can use
the merchandise,” and anyhow he suggested we use a different name, and so
we finally decided since they were calling us Ruby anyhow, with that in mind,
and business reasons, that is, and we finally decided to—Sam and I did first,
you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; and Jack did it down in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How much time elapsed between when you and Sam changed
your name and Jack changed his?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Gee, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you ever discuss with Jack the reasons for his changing
his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you have any idea why he changed his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; it never came up. We never discussed it as far as I can
remember, we just never discussed that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is my understanding correct then that the changing of your
name and Sam’s name was directly tied with your activity in connection with
Earl Products, and thus since Hyman didn’t have any connection with Earl
Products and Jack didn’t have any connection with Earl Products at the time
you two changed your name, why there was no reason for those two at that
time to change their name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, Hyman never changed his name, as you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; I know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I really don’t know the reason for Jack. He may have had the
same reason but since he did it there, and we never brought it up it just never
was brought into our conversations, that I can remember. We may have—at
that time it was nothing important to us, and it happened along about 15–16
years ago, I think. I think we changed ours in 1947, I don’t even remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I think we can finish this off here now. I want to hand you what
has been marked as “Washington, D.C., June 3, 1964, deposition of Earl Ruby,
Exhibit No. 3.” This is a copy of a report which was prepared by two FBI agents,
White and Lee of an interview they had with you on November 25 in Chicago,
which consists of two pages. The pages are numbered at the bottom 171 and 172.
I want to hand it to you and ask you if you had a chance to read that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are there any changes or corrections that you think ought to be
made in that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, here in the first paragraph it says, “In 1946 his brothers Jack
Ruby” I think, I am not sure of the date. I think it was 1947, and Jack didn’t
change his name when we did. He changed it later in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. Let’s read into the record the part you are talking
about. In the second paragraph you are talking about the sentence which reads,
“He said that in 1946 his brothers Jack Ruby and Sam Ruby along with himself
legally changed their names from Rubenstein to Ruby for business purposes.”</p>

<p>Now the correct date of your changing your name is when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I think it was 1947.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And in any event Jack did not change his name at the same time
that you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Okay. Take your time and refer to them—you have notes, refer
to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Down here in the sixth paragraph it says, “following military service
Jack returned to Chicago where he resided for several months and was not
employed to his, Earl Ruby’s knowledge,” that is not correct.</p>

<p>When Jack came back from the service we immediately took him in as a partner
in Earl Products Co., so that is wrong. And then they said about 1946. I think
in 1947 he went to Dallas. However, I am not sure of that. You probably have
that date.</p>

<p>I see on this next to the last paragraph where it says Earl Ruby stated he
could give no reason why Jack Ruby shot Oswald except Jack is highly—is a
highly emotional type and may have thought he was doing everyone a great
service, I don’t remember that, the exact words. I don’t think I would have made
that statement completely. I <span class="locked">mean——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you have some feeling at the time that Jack may have thought
he was doing a service to the country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. To tell you the truth, I was so upset that I may have made the statement
but I am not sure. You know I was—when was this, this was the next day,
right, Monday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That is it for this one. Some of them are almost exact duplicates.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to hand you what has been marked as “Washington,
D.C., June 3, 1964, deposition of Earl Ruby Exhibit 4.” And that purports to be
an interview that Mr. Robichau and Mr. Wilson of the FBI had with you on
November 25 in Southfield, Mich. It consists of six pages and they are numbered
consecutively at the bottom 173 to 178.</p>

<p>Have you had a chance to read that over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you indicate what changes or corrections should be made
thereon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, in the fourth paragraph I am not certain as to whether my
father was born in Russia and as to whether my mother was born in Poland. I
think my older sisters and brothers know more about that than I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was the experience of your mother and father in Europe a topic
which was discussed very often in the home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. My father’s experiences were, in telling about the hardships of it and
the persecutions of the Jews.</p>

<p>I have one other correction here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In the fifth paragraph it states here that Jack was employed by
Earl Products after he first left the service. He wasn’t employed. He was a
part owner. It clarifies it in the next sentence, however.</p>

<p>Now, on page 2, the third paragraph this states here that I may have said that
A. Weinberg was a fourth removed cousin, but I find that that is not so. She
never was a cousin of ours.</p>

<p>And then on page 5 in the first paragraph it states that from 1939 to 1942 I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
employed as a carpenter at building the barracks at Great Lakes. The date is
incorrect. I worked there from, on in the year of 1942.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you want to take a pen and cross that off and correct it
properly and then initial it, initial your deletion there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In the last sentence on page 6 it states that Earl and his three
brothers had their names legally changed from Rubenstein to Ruby during 1947.
That is incorrect. It should be Earl and Sam and Earl’s wife, Marge. Shall I
change it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; why don’t you?</p>

<p>Why don’t you sign that on the first page then. Sign Exhibit No. 4.</p>

<p>I will give you Exhibit No. 3 and ask you to sign that.</p>

<p>One other thing that occurred to me before we go on here. We have obtained
various birth records and so forth, and in trying to identify which record pertains
to which child, I noticed that your parents—actually your given names
were Hebrew names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is my understanding correct that your given Hebrew name was
Isadore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; actually I was, the name listed was, Izzy, on my birth record.
Is that what you are referring to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Izzy, I-z-z-y, that is me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you recall what the given names of your various sisters are?
Could you relate those to us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I couldn’t. Eileen I think was Ida, I think. The others I
don’t know. You have to talk to one of the older members of the family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Incidentally, also in Exhibit No. 3, I noticed that you had, somebody
has put some penciled mark numbers, were those your marks and did you
wish to comment on those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, it is just an error there—that should be scrap iron and junk
handlers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, it is corrected for the record, you just state it for the
record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Here is a repetition of that other one where it says I stated he was
doing every one a great service. I don’t remember saying that and I am just not
sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Let me hand you what has been marked as Exhibit No. 5 and has been further
marked “Washington, D.C., June 3, 1964, deposition of Earl Ruby” which purports
to be a copy of an interview with you also at South Field, Mich., on November 26,
1963, with special agents Robichau and Wilson.</p>

<p>The exhibit consists of six pages, numbered in sequence 11 through 16. I will
hand it to you and ask you if you have any corrections that you want to make
in that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Here again on page 5 it states I worked at the building—the barracks
at Great Lakes from 1942. It was only during 1942. Shall I change it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; if you wish.</p>

<p>Do you want to sign Exhibit No. 5?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to hand you what has been marked for identification
as “Washington, D.C., June 3, 1964, deposition of Earl Ruby Exhibit No. 6.”
This is a copy of an interview which Agent Robichau purports to have had with
you on November 27 in Detroit, Mich.</p>

<p>Would you want to look at that and tell us if there are any changes or corrections
that you would make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; no corrections. Shall I sign it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right, fine.</p>

<p>I will hand you what has been marked for identification as “Exhibit No. 7,
Washington, D.C., June 3, 1964, deposition of Earl Ruby.” This purports to be
a copy of an interview report prepared by Special Agent George Parfet of the
FBI. The interview took place with you on November 28 in Chicago. It consists
of two pages and it is numbered at the bottom pages 15 and 16.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
Would you want to look at that and tell us if there are any changes or corrections
that you would care to make?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Here on page 2 it mentioned that I had never heard of Jack being
mentally ill or depressed. However, I know he was depressed several years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did you know that at the time you gave that interview report,
gave that interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I knew he was depressed but I didn’t understand it completely.
I didn’t know that it was called depression at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How did it appear, how would you have described it at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, that he wouldn’t shave and he wouldn’t bathe, and he
wouldn’t go out, but at that time I didn’t know what it was called. But after
thinking it over, when he came up to Chicago once, he was terribly depressed,
as I stated before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. How would you have described him at the time you saw him— what
would you have said was the matter with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I was just—let me see what words I can use to describe it—I
would have said he was disgusted, not knowing that actually he was depressed
until I really learned what the word “depressed” means.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was his attitude one more of hostility or belligerence toward what
had happened rather than one of submission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; it was one of submission. He wouldn’t go any places as I
stated. He didn’t want to wash or clean himself up and I had to more or less
force him to get in the shower and things of that sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. What about the things he said, though. Were these—you used
the term “disgust”—did he speak in the manner of someone who was disgusted
would speak?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, he didn’t even have much to say, if I recall. He didn’t even
have much to say. He tried to keep to himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did he live at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I mean in my presence. In other words, he would go in another
room or sit in a chair and just sit there without making—just thinking to himself
about whatever was going through his mind. He was listless.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you married at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, I was married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack come and live with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Where did he live at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He came to the family and that is where I came to see him. In
fact, he was so depressed that I took him to try to cheer him up, I had to go to
New York for a business trip, a show that was taking place there and I took
him for a ride, we were driving anyhow, and I thought it would pep him up a
little bit, you know, to go on a trip. But it didn’t help much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Was your attitude toward him this time one of sympathy or
couldn’t you figure out what was eating this guy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I would say he was. I just thought he was disgusted with
things, little realizing that he was in a state of depression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. But were you sympathetic toward him at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes; as I said, that is why I took him on the trip. I tried to
encourage him. I told him “Maybe we can find something for you to get into,”
as I mentioned before, “Some business we can get you started in or something.”</p>

<p>However, he decided, as I stated before, to go back to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did he ever tell you why he decided to go back to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t recall, he may have, but I can’t recall just now.</p>

<p>I see another, the last paragraph on page 2. I didn’t even remember that
conversation with the agent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Would you read the paragraph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It states here, “Earl Ruby was specifically asked regarding his
residence in New Haven, Conn., in 1940. He has stated that he had never been
in New Haven, Conn., in his life and in that period was engaged in the drycleaning
business on Cicero Avenue in Chicago.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Is that statement a correct statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. When we were selling we used to travel the east coast but I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
have only been there—I don’t remember being there, but if I had been there, I
would have been there only for a day. I think he asked me if I lived there for
any length of time, if I recall, but I am not sure. I don’t recall <span class="locked">this——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Were you in the drycleaning business on Cicero Avenue at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. As far as I know, yes; I had an independent cleaning route at that
time. I used to call on friends and pick up their cleaning and deliver it right
to their home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You didn’t operate a cleaning plant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no; but this is where I worked out of. Maybe he just cut it
short. I brought my cleaning to this plant in Chicago, on Cicero Avenue, in
Chicago, they cleaned it and charged me a wholesale price and I added on a
profit, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I am going to hand you what has been marked as “Exhibit 8,
Washington, D.C., June 3, 1964, deposition of Earl Ruby.” It consists of two
pages numbered 210 and 211 and purports to be a copy of a report which Agent
George Parfet prepared with respect to that interview he had with you on
November 28 at South Field, Mich.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I didn’t sign the other one.</p>

<p>(Earl Ruby Exhibits Nos. 5, 6, 7, and 8 were marked for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. I will state for the record then, you have just signed Exhibit
No. 7, and if you will look at Exhibit No. 8, tell us if there are any changes or
corrections you would make in that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Here again it is almost a duplicate of the previous, what do you
call it again, number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Interview report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. What is this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. That is Exhibit No. 8, and this is Exhibit No. 7 that I have here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The last paragraph again as stated in the previous one. They are
almost identical.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; it looks like they are identical copies and they were just
included in different places in our materials.</p>

<p>Let me hand it to you then and let me ask you to sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Sign it anyhow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; Exhibit No. 8.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes; Exhibit No. 8.</p>

<p>I finally hand you what has been marked for identification as “Exhibit No. 9,
Washington, D.C., June 3, 1964, deposition of Earl Ruby.” This is a copy of a
report which Agent Robichau made with you of an interview he had on December
2, 1963, at Detroit, Mich.</p>

<p>Would you tell us if you have any additions or corrections or changes to make
in that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; this is correct. That she is not related in any way to our
family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, that concludes all the questions that I have, and I presume that Mr.
Hubert has or he would have come back in.</p>

<p>Are there any topics that we haven’t covered that you feel that we ought to—is
there anything further that you would like to say? You have got the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I think, and this took place at the trial, and after the first
policeman had testified as to statements made by my brother Jack, that evening
when I saw Jack, he told me that he is going to the electric chair.</p>

<p>He said because he never made any of those statements, and now he knows
what Wade has in mind, because if Wade wants to send you to the chair he can,
and he always does, and that is why he has the record that he has.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Do you remember who the first policeman was who testified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I don’t. And he told me on several occasions that he never
made the statements the police testified that he did make, and in fact, if the
record will be checked, it is proved that the statement that Dean made couldn’t
have been true—Officer Dean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Why do you say that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Because at the time when he said he had been talking—that Jack
made a statement, Jack, he is the one who said Jack told him 2 days before at 4
o’clock, I think the time was, that he stated, that Jack told him that he was
going to get Oswald.</p>

<p>At that time Jack was at home with Eva, so Jack couldn’t have made that
statement to him, and, of course, this has been brought out in the petition or
motion for a new trial, so it is in the official record, so to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Now, when Jack talked to you the first night after, or after the
first police officer testified, was that first police officer Sergeant Dean, or was
that another police officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; that was another police officer. Dean was the last police
officer, if I recall correctly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did Jack tell you what he did say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; but he said he never made those statements.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Did <span class="locked">Jack——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He repeated it several times on different occasions. He said, “I
never made that—any of those statements and I know how Wade operates. He
is going to send me to the chair. Now I know what he has got in mind.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let the record reflect that I am going to give you a copy which we
have made of your three-page statement which you have entered into the record
and which is marked as Exhibit No. 2, and also a copy of Exhibit No. 1 which
we have marked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You are giving that back to me because I have a copy of Exhibit
No. 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. You can have that copy back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. OK.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Are there any other matters that you think ought to be covered
that we haven’t covered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I can’t think of any. I think we have covered them all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Let me ask you one last question which I started to ask some
hours ago.</p>

<p>That is this: Between the time you first saw Jack in Dallas, and the last time
you saw him in Dallas, what changes did you see in him, if any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I think as I stated, he lost probably 25 or 30 pounds, and he couldn’t
seem to grasp or understand conversations or questions. I have talked to him
many times on the phone since then, and he still thinks—in fact as of now, he
don’t even think I am alive. He thinks they killed me and my family, my
children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. When you first saw him in Dallas did he have these—did you
have any trouble communicating with him, did he show any lack of understanding
when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no; it wasn’t—yes; I must change that. There was a slight
hesitancy on his part to understand questions that I put to him. He would shake
his head when I would ask him questions sometimes and as though he didn’t
understand, and these were just ordinary questions of routine matters, just about
the trial or Belli. We discussed Belli, and he said, even at the beginning there
he said, “They don’t talk to me. Why don’t they talk to me longer,” and yet
Belli was there for hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. This wasn’t the very first time you saw him. This was on an
occasion later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That is right. It had to be later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. All right. I have nothing more. And if you have nothing more
I want to thank you very much for taking this time for us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I hope I can help you and I hope you can help us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. We want to assemble all the facts that we possibly can and prepare
a report that will be as fair and as impartial as can be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You want me to check on that professor at Northwestern University,
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. And if you would give us the names of those employees.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The list I have on that. I can possibly get the information as to
where my brother received the psychiatric treatment when he was about 10
years old. Do you want me to send that to you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. If you would get us that we would appreciate it, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Shall I mail it just here the same address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin</span>. Yes.</p>

<h2 id="GRANT">TESTIMONY OF MRS. EVA GRANT</h2>
</div>

<p>The testimony of Mrs. Eva Grant was taken at 3:30 p.m., on May 28, 1964, in
the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President’s
Commission. Mrs. Eva Grant was accompanied by her attorney, Phil
Burleson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Mrs. Eva Grant. Mrs. Grant is represented
by Mr. Phil Burleson, her attorney.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant, my name is Leon D. Hubert. I am a member of the advisory staff
of the general counsel on the President’s Commission on the Assassination of
President Kennedy. Under the provisions of Executive Order 11130, dated
November 29, 1963, issued by President Johnson, the joint resolution of Congress
No. 137, and the rules of procedure adopted by the President’s Commission in
conformance with the Executive order and that joint resolution, I have been
authorized to take a sworn deposition from you. I state to you now that the
general nature of this Commission’s inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate, and report
upon the facts relevant to the assassination of President Kennedy and the subsequent
violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald. In particular, as to you, Mrs. Grant,
the nature of the inquiry today is to determine what facts you know about the
death of Oswald, and the life and activities of your brother, Jack Ruby, and
any other pertinent facts that you may know about the general inquiry.</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Grant, I believe that you appear here today by a request made
to you by a letter from Mr. J. Lee Rankin, general counsel of the staff for
the President’s Commission. I ask you now if you have received that letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you state to us, please, what the date of the letter is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. May 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And it was received by you on what date?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. On the following date. I think, what is today—Thursday? I know
I called here, it seems to me, Monday or Tuesday now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, you have no objection to the taking of this deposition
at the present time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, will you rise and raise your right hand so that I may
administer the oath?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you state your full name, please, ma’am?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, I go under the name of Eva L. Grant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you spell the first name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Eva (spelling) E-v-a and “L.” Let me explain something to you—I
married a man who used the name Grant, but the name, which you will
notice, is Granovsky, but I married him under that name and I used that name
for at least 25 years. I married in 1936, so you figure it out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And how old are you, Mrs. Grant?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Fifty-five.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And where do you reside?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. 3929 Rawlins, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you at present occupied?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, in the course of this investigation I hope to conduct it in
this way, that I will question you concerning certain segments or blocks or
questions that will relate to a subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
Under the rules of the proceedings your counsel may make any objection at
anytime and under the rules also he could ask you any questions that he wants
to at the end of the whole hearing, but I think, for ease of handling, it would
be better if he asked you his questions after we have finished a particular area
or block. I will try to indicate to your counsel when I am passing from one
to the other, so that we can stop there and let him ask the questions as to
that block, but I invite you, Mr. Burleson, if I should overlook and pass on to
the next block, and it is obvious to you that I am, will you please interrupt
and we will then have your questions relative to that block, so that the whole
of the matter will be together in that way.</p>

<p>I think that perhaps the first thing I should like for you to do is identify the
statements that were made by you to the FBI in several interviews that they
had of you. Now, for the purpose of identification, first I am marking these
exhibits as follows, to wit: “Dallas, Tex., May 28, 1964, Exhibit 1 to the deposition
of Eva Grant.” I have signed my name to that and placed my initials
on each of the subsequent pages in the lower right-hand corner. That Exhibit No.
1 purports to be the report of an interview of you by FBI Agents Jack Peden
and Gaston Thompson on November 25, 1963, consisting of seven pages, and
I have previously handed this Exhibit 1 to you and your attorney with the
request that you read it and make any notes you wish, because what we want
to do now is to state whether this Exhibit 1 represents a correct version of your
understanding of the facts, and I will now ask you—have you read Exhibit 1?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. With the aid and assistance of your counsel, would you tell us
please, ma’am, whether Exhibit 1 is correct, pointing out any incorrections—things
that are incorrect—anything that is omitted?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I would have to see that again; may I?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, ma’am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Mr. Hubert, I might make a suggestion here since I have gone
over it with her, possibly I could take her now and go into these areas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That will be a good way to do it because my general question
is whether or not it is a completely correct document, and, therefore, to the
extent it is not, I think it would be best if you would take her over to show that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. May I suggest that you use a system of quoting the sentence to
which you address yourself so it is clearly identified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Mrs. Grant, on page 1 of this—it is correct to the best of your
present memory, is it not?</p>

<p>Off the record.</p>

<p>(A discussion between Counsel Hubert and Counsel Burleson off the record.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span> (reading instrument referred to). Let me go ahead and say
this now—you do want me to say it—when Jack looked at that Weissman ad, it
seems to me this is what he <span class="locked">said——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Wait, are you making reference to a specific sentence in here,
or are you adding to something?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, I didn’t say here that he called. I think he was over there.
I’m almost sure, but I may have said it—will you tell him about me? I was
so sick—I mean—I <span class="locked">was——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Well, we will get into that in just a minute. Is there anything
in this—on this first page that is incorrect as you now view things?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span> (reading). Well, you see, right here, “he said he contacted”—he
was in the Dallas Morning News when the President was assassinated. He
was placing his ads and he was in the building from 11 until, maybe, at 1:30,
and that should have been put in here and I thought I told him that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Well, let’s refer to that—on this last sentence on page 1, it
starts out with, “She stated that Jack Ruby told her that he was at the Dallas
Morning News which ran his advertisements and asked them. ‘Where in the hell
do you get off taking an ad like that? Are you money hungry?’”</p>

<p>What do you want to say about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. There was a fellow there that takes his ads and his name is
Newman. I think his name is John Newman, and Jack was in that area where
this all takes place and the telephones were ringing, and Jack says people were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
canceling their ads, you know, complete commercial ads and subscriptions and
the place was a madhouse. He was in the Dallas Morning News—he went there,
you <span class="locked">see——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. To this statement, though, that I have just quoted—your
answer is what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes: but he did call me from there—he was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. That morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right—he was in the Dallas Morning News and John
<span class="locked">knew——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. So, when you use the word “contacted”——</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. They used that word—that isn’t even my word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. He had some contact with them is really my question—whether
by being there in person or by telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He bawled John Newman out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right; I think that clarifies that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He said, “What in the hell?” And he says, “Well, I take orders
from my superiors,” that’s what Jack said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Is that the only change or the only thing that you want to
add on the first page?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span> (reads). Now, you see, let me explain this—he didn’t talk to the
Times Herald until later in the day, as far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right: let me ask you this—you are now talking about, in
the second paragraph, starting with, “She advised that he told her he had
called the Times Herald Newspaper in Dallas and they had advised him that
they had turned down and refused to accept the same advertisement.” What
about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, it seemed to be later in the day when all the commotion
had died down <span class="locked">and——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Later on Friday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. The same Friday, and if I know him, he probably was using
the Dallas Morning News phone because he didn’t leave there until 1:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, is there anything else you want to revise or change on
page 1?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, I would say they were at—you know, they came with
that ad and they turned it down and that’s about it. It’s in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Is there anything else on page 1?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, that part there that he <span class="locked">contacted——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Well, we have already gone over that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He was in the Dallas Morning News when all this took place.
It was the greatest commotion in history in that office, and he was crying,
and he was standing against the wall, and he said there were <span class="locked">people——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right; is there anything else though?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Burleson and the witness, Mrs. Grant.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, on the record. On page 2, Mrs. Grant, are there some
changes or revisions that you might want to make in connection with that?
I direct your attention specifically to this statement, “He informed that early
Thursday morning, November 21, 1963, Jack Ruby, as was his custom, placed
advertisements in both Dallas papers concerning the entertainment to be offered
at the Carousel and Vegas nightclubs, Dallas, Texas, which clubs he had an
interest in.” Now, in reference to that, what do you want to add in reference
to that? Was that actually the morning of the 22d after midnight of the 21st?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, there are many weeks out of the year he would go in on—which
is Friday morning after 2:30 in the morning and it seemed to me this
was an unusual week. I have been away from the Vegas Club which I usually
take care of, but he went to the Vegas Club to pick up money and he was on
the phone half of the night, he said, calling for a band.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. But this <span class="locked">date——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. So, he never got that—that’s the wrong date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. That date really should be early Friday morning, November
22, 1963?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Which would have been following Thursday. All right. Now,
directing your <span class="locked">attention——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Can I add in over here something. When he was at my apartment
Friday the phone rang and Andy, who is our bartender, said, “Jack, call
Don Safran.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Just a minute, we are coming to that, but I want to direct
your attention now to the next statement after the one I just read. “She advised
that after President Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, he called
the newspapers to change the advertisements to show that the club would be
closed Friday, Saturday and Sunday, November 22d, 23d, and 24th, 1963.” Would
you care to explain that just a little bit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; I heard him call the Dallas Morning News, because there
was a paper coming out at 10 o’clock at night and it seemed to me that they
said it was too late—the Dallas news—you know how it comes out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. The first edition?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; but he said, anyway, put it in Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday, and I <span class="locked">heard——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And it was on the afternoon of November 22d?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. That he called from your place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. He called both of the papers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right. Then, he called the Times Herald, but in between
this, it seems that Andy called, who was in charge of the Carousel Club
and he said, “Call Don Saffran.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right. Now, we are going to get onto that but is that all
you wanted to say about what we have just talked about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. The next immediate following statement says, “She said that
Don Saffran (PH) a newspaper reporter for the Dallas Times Herald, called him
and wanted to know if he was sure,” and I am continuing on page 3, “he was
not going to operate those clubs on any of those three days. He pointed out
that some of the other clubs apparently were not going to be closed for even
one night.</p>

<p>“When Ruby heard that the other clubs were not going to be closed, he became
quite upset and asked Don how anyone with any kind of conscience could
dance and have a good time after the President had been killed. He ended up
by telling Don that he did not care what anyone else did, that he was going to
close for those three days.”</p>

<p>And that is the end of those several sentences. What do you want to add
in your deposition about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, as I said, Andy called him and he called Don and he says,
“I’m going to close tonight—tonight.” And this is what Don says, “Are you
going to be closed Saturday and Sunday?” I don’t know what Jack said, I’ll be
honest, at that time, but Jack—there was about a 3-minute hesitation and he
says, “I’m calling him back,” and this is what I heard him say—he said, “Don
this is Jack Ruby.” He said, “Listen, I will be closed for three days—tonight,
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday,” and he says, “I don’t care when the other clubs
close,” and he says, “We’re broke anyway so—”. In other words, he felt he
can’t get any worse off than he is—it isn’t that he makes a million dollars—I
mean, that was his attitude.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. The rest of page 3, the following three paragraphs on page 3
appear to be correct; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. But I wanted to clear this—you see, this wasn’t put in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Well, let me ask you this: We are now referring to the first
full or complete paragraph on page 3, which says, “Mrs. Grant displayed a page
from the Dallas Morning News, dated Saturday, November 23d, 1963, in Section 1,
Page 19, containing a one column ad approximately four inches in length, stating
that the Carousel Club on Main Street, Dallas, would be closed Friday, Saturday,
and Sunday.” What do you want to say about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, I understand the early edition didn’t have it yet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right. In reference to the next paragraph, it says, “Mrs.
Grant recalled that on the day of the President’s assassination, November 22,
1963, Jack Ruby telephoned her at least eight times and made three personal
visits to her apartment,”—what correction or change do you want to make?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I think he came twice—one time early in the day and once later
in the afternoon with the groceries.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. So, where you said “three <span class="locked">times”——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It was only two times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. You think now that it was only two times?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. The rest of that paragraph appears to be correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. The next paragraph on page 3 appears to be correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. A continuation of the last paragraph on page 3 and on page 4,
does it appear to be correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span> (read). Could I add something here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right, in the last sentence of the first paragraph, at the
top of the page, the statement appears, “She stated that he discussed sending
flowers to the place near the spot where the President was assassinated and
she feels sure that he did have flowers delivered to that spot?”</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, we had a regular florist, called “Your Florist,” but I was
in the hospital and he sent dried up, thrown out flowers that he charged, you
know, a large amount of money for. I told him to get another florist, but he
didn’t. He thinks he didn’t anyway—we are almost sure he didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, directing your attention to the first complete paragraph
on page 4, which says, “Mrs. Grant informed that Jack Ruby was in her apartment
on November 22d, 1963, from approximately 5:30 p.m. until approximately
7:15 p.m. and then he dressed and went to the synagogue for prayers.” What
correction or addition do you want to make to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It was much earlier than 5:30—more like 4:30 at that time. You
see, he was there earlier in the day, but I don’t remember whether it was much
earlier—I think he came before he even went to the newspaper office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. “Somewhere around 4:30” should be “around 5:30”?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; and he went home to dress. You see, he didn’t live at my
place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right; 7:15 is about right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Then he dressed—he went home to dress from your place before
he went to the synagogue?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; but I want to tell you. He looked so bad and he was so much
a broken man and more confused and I really said something to this effect to him,
I said, “Do you think you are able to drive?” He says, “Yes,” but instead of him
going home, he went to Dealey Plaza and he was there sometime, because he
didn’t get home until much later, and he didn’t get to the synagogue until almost
all of the services were over, but he didn’t have any idea about time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, as to this next paragraph on page 4, does it appear to be
correct as written?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, in the case that he told me that he took what <span class="locked">Larry——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And there are some other things written, but what is written
there, does that appear to be correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes. [Reading.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Let me go off the record just a second.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Mr. Burleson and the witness, Mrs. Grant, off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Is this what is right, here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; that is correct—he said he was up every night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Is this correct, then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, as to the last paragraph on page 4 which starts on page 4,
does that appear to be correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span> (reading). Yes; he called Stanley from my home, and that’s why
I know, and they were talking about these signs and he showed me——<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Just read this, though, and tell me if this is correct.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span> (reading). Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right. Now, as to the first complete paragraph on page 5,
would you read that and see if that appears to be correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span> (reading). You know, I don’t know if he was there twice Saturday
or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. At my apartment; you see, he was there from 3:30 on to 8 o’clock
that evening—I know he spent about 4 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. That’s on the 23d?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right. Whether he was there earlier, I don’t know. I
know Friday he was there twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. But to the best of your recollection and remembrance at this
time, this is correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, he was there from close to about—I would say 3½ to 4 or
4 hours and 15 minutes for a Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And you say that it appears to be correct, the whole paragraph?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Now, this is what I want to get clear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right. Let me read something into the record. With the
statement “She stated that from the remarks made by Ruby during the 10:20 p.m.
telephone conversation, that she gained the impression that Ruby had been at his
residence, 223 South Ewing (Apartment 207), Dallas, Texas, since a short time
after leaving her place around 8 p.m. the same date.” Now, what do you want
to say about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, I don’t know if it was Friday or Saturday. He said he was
going to the station, and I’ll be honest with you, I didn’t question—radio, television,
or police station because it didn’t make a bit of difference to me. I was
too gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. But that does not have anything to do with this, does it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He didn’t mention what station—he mentioned a station, but I
don’t know if he went to the radio station, television, or police station, and I
don’t think—it seems to me it was on a Friday instead of Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. But the statement, though, is correct as far as you know? It
may not be complete, but it is correct as far as you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, here it says on Saturday, but it is not Saturday. I think
it was Friday after the synagogue. I think he called me, and he was in Phil’s,
and he was ordering sandwiches, and I think it was Friday. I’ll tell you the
truth, I was so confused that night I don’t know how I got anything out of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right. Let me direct your attention to the next paragraph:
“At 11:30 p.m. that same night, he called and told her he had been at the
station where he had talked to Henry Wade, the district attorney, Dallas
County, Tex., and Russ Knight of radio station KLIF, Dallas, Tex.”</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. And that should have been Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. That should be Friday night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I think they both occurred Friday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. You think the reference in the preceding paragraph that we
quoted should have been Friday night instead of Saturday night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I’m sure when he left the synagogue he went to Phil’s, he ordered
sandwiches and he called me from Phil’s, and he said he was going to a station.
He may have told me Saturday what station he had been at, but at that time
he did not tell me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. If this were in this paragraph I have just quoted about starting
at about 11:30 p.m. that same night, that should be, then, Friday night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I’m sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. With that substitution there, is everything else in that paragraph
true?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, he just said he was going to a station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did he tell you he talked with Henry Wade?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did he tell <span class="locked">you——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Wait a minute—the phone rang—wait a minute—there were
a group of men. The phone rang and Jack was nearest the phone, wherever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
this takes place—where they interrogate people or talk to people—I haven’t a
vague idea, but yet I have been up there. Someone said answer the phone and
he picked up the phone and he said, “It’s for you, Henry.” He told me this on
Saturday.</p>

<p>A man at a station, and this time I think—this was Friday night—that I
know, and he said, “Can I talk to Henry Wade?” And I think it was Russ
Knight on the other end of the phone who said, “Okay,” and they were giving
Russ Knight, who was—now, I know it was with KLIF because he was with
KLIF, but he didn’t tell me this until Saturday when he came over but I’ll be
honest, he told me when he was going to a station on Friday I did not know
whether it was radio, television, or police station—I know he was in Phil’s and
he ordered a lot of sandwiches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Would you read, then, with that explanation, and see if these
two paragraphs are correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right, let’s move on to the last paragraph on page 5, which
continues on page 6. Would you read it and see if it is correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span> (reading). You see, I’ll tell you—I know when he got home
Saturday afternoon, he left me—I made dinner for him and he called me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Was it about 12:40?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; he called me before that, once again, I would say it was
more like 10:30 or 10 o’clock—he was still at home—Saturday he was still
home—10 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right; let me interrupt you—Eva—just a second, and let
me read to you this paragraph starting on page 5 at the bottom, “Mrs. Grant
stated that she next heard from her brother, Jack Ruby, about 12:40 a.m.,
Sunday, November 24. 1963, at which time he called her by telephone.” Now,
you say that you heard from him sometime before 12:40?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. This fits in here—this part here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. What I just read fits back up into the first paragraph?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No—on Saturday he left my home around 8 o’clock. I did not
hear from him for about 2 hours, it seems that long anyway. He called and
he said—I know exactly what he said—he said he was making liver that George
bought and getting dressed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. That George Senator bought?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And he was at home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; George was not at home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. I mean, Jack was at his apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; this was Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. And in those 2 hours, I assume he took a shower and from the
telephone messages he must have made five long-distance calls from what I
heard—that is Saturday—I don’t know where he went, but I do know he called
me back again and it was after midnight, and it was near 1 o’clock, as much as
I could remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Would you continue on page 6, that continuation of the paragraph,
and see if the rest of it is correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, this is what I <span class="locked">said——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, let me read that into the record—just a second.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. At 12:40 he was at home. From the way he talked I assumed
he was at home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Just a second, now. “She said she gained the impression
that he was at his residence.”</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. For Saturday is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. From—for Saturday night when he called you at 12:40?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Would you read the next sentence in there and see if that
is correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, directing your attention to the next paragraph, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
is the first complete paragraph on page 6, would you read that and see if that
is correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span> (reading). That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, the last paragraph on page 6, which continues on page 7—would
you read that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Okay. [Read.] That’s all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I am handing you and your attorney a document which has been
identified as follows: That is to say, I have written in the margin of this document,
this consisting of one page, the words, “Dallas, Tex., May 28, 1964, Exhibit
No. 2 deposition of Eva Grant,” and I have signed my name and this purports to be
of a telephone interview between you and the FBI agent Jack Peden on November
29 1963, and I will ask you if it is correct, if anything has been omitted, any
corrections to be made or anything wrong about it in regards to the first paragraph,
which says, “Mrs. Eva L. Grant, 3929 Rawlins, was telephonically contacted
at the Vegas Club, 3508 Oak Lawn, Dallas, Tex., and she stated that she
first came to Dallas Tex., in August of either 1942 or August 1943.”</p>

<p>Did you come here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; I stayed a very short while. It was during the war and I
lived out in Oak Cliff—it seems to me on Ohio Street somewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you say that you were really just passing through?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; but I was just here for a couple of weeks and then I left
and you see I was always on the way from Chicago to Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Are there any other changes or corrections in this that you
want to make?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, this building—wasn’t—go back to 1945.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Let me read into the record the second paragraph, “She advised
that a building was being erected at 1717 South Ervay, in Dallas, shortly after
she arrived in Dallas, and she arranged to lease it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; but that was not until 1945.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was in 1945?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I’m sure the last part of it was 1945.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was in 1945?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I’m sure the last part of 1945.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is the last sentence in the second paragraph correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, yes; that’s correct—let me explain this—you see, when
they say I went to the west coast, yes; but I didn’t stay there too long. I mean,
it took me from 6 months to 8 months to come back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Let me ask you this. In the last paragraph, Mrs. Grant stated
that “she left Dallas in 1948 and went to the west coast. She informed that
she returned to Dallas two or three times after 1948 and has made Dallas her
home since April 1959”; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I was here many more years than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right, what is the true situation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Even if I left, I wasn’t gone maybe a half a year or 8 months
even, and then I came back and I stayed here again, and then Jack had another
club called Hernando’s Hideaway, and I was here a year then, maybe 2 years.
Gee, I was mostly here since 1948 than any place I have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. But you did move to other places?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I went to Los Angeles or Chicago—no other place than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And with those additions and corrections, this is correct;
is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; I mean—I wouldn’t call any other place my home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right, that’s all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. <span class="locked">Now——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. You know, of course, that I went on the road and came back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I have marked for identification a document which purports to
be an interview on December 2, 1963, of you by FBI Agent Jack Peden, and
for purposes of identification I have marked it as follows: “Dallas, Tex., May 28,
1964, Exhibit No. 3 of the deposition of Eva Grant,” and I have signed my name
and ask you the same comments with respect to that document?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span> (examining instrument referred to). It’s going back so far—yes;
this is correct, but there are a lot of things that happened, other things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; we understand that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. But this is correct as far as it goes, and as far as it states?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. There are other matters, but we won’t go into those at this
particular time—this is true and correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I mean, if you look at those States, and then look at those, you
would think I was in both places at one time, but it wasn’t like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right, but this is true as far as it goes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; of course, there are some—who remembers everything—I
had a little restaurant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, we’ll get to the next document, which is a report of an
interview on December 31, 1963, between FBI Agent Gaston Thompson and
yourself, which I have marked for identification, “Dallas, Tex., May 28, 1964,
Exhibit No. 4, deposition of Eva Grant,” and I have signed my name, and I ask
you if that is correct and if there are any additions or omissions, and if so
please state what you think is incorrect as to that document?</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant (read instrument referred to).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. I will ask you about the first paragraph—is it correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, getting to the second paragraph, I’ll ask you if it is
correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, that’s what I told them because that’s what I thought—they
told me he wasn’t dead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Have you heard anything since then to the contrary?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I have not spoken to anybody—to anybody who knows where
he is—whether he is dead, outside of what his name, Clements here told me
they found him—he’s alive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Directing your attention to the sentence in the second paragraph
that says, “Frank had a sister named Rose Solomon in Los Angeles,”
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; instead of sister, it should be aunt. He only had one sister
and no other living relatives I would know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Other than Rose Solomon, who is an aunt and not a sister?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It seems it was his mother’s sister, and that was the closest
family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Other than one change there, as far as this statement is concerned,
it is true and correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That is right—that’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Burleson and Hubert.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, let’s proceed along these lines. What I would like to know
is something of the family background, Mrs. Grant.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I’m ashamed to tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. For instance, your mother’s name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Let me explain the situation, even with my family, my mother’s
fathers’ name was Rutkowfsky.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me handle it this way—if you will just answer my questions,
then at the end of each one of these blocks of questions, your attorney will be
able to clarify anything he wants to.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. But this is something—there has been a mixup in the family.
A lot of times my sister would say her name <span class="locked">was——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span> (interrupting). If you will just answer my question and then
we will move on this way. What was you mother’s name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Fanny.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember what her last name was prior to her marriage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s what I’m trying to remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You said it was Rutkowfsky, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I think my mother’s mother was married twice. Sometimes
they used the name as Turek [spelling] T-u-r-e-k, but her father’s name was
Rutkowfsky—he was a doctor of medicine in Zimbrola, Poland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did your mother have any brothers or sisters?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you name them, please, if you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. One was Sarah—they are dead—do you still want the names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, ma’am—did she marry anyone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes, I know the name real good—wait a minute—isn’t that terrible—Moskowitz
[spelling] M-o-s-k-o-w-i-t-z.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did any of your mother’s <span class="locked">relatives——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. There is another one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Her brother lived until a couple of years ago. His name was
Harry Rutland, and after he arrived in this country, which is 65 years ago, I
would say, or close to that time, he changed his name from Rutkowfsky to
Rutland, and he lived for 45 years in Denver, Colo., and he died in, let’s say, the
last 3 or 4 years, I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did the sister that you mentioned come to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All three of the children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. At different times they arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Came to the United States and settled in the United States; is
that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there any communication between your mother and her
sisters and brothers after they came here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They were your aunts, in fact?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, we were very close when they were alive. Let me say there
was a great family, but they were killed out in Europe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All of these people are dead now and have been for some time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, turning to your father’s side of the family, what was
your father’s name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. His name was Joseph Rubenstein.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have any brothers and sisters?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; he had a brother that came over 2 years later. His name
was Abraham.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He died 7 years ago or 6 years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he live in the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; he did, in Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. He had settled here too, then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes, he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your father’s employment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He was a carpenter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he work for anyone as a regular proposition?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; he worked for the U.S. Government during World War I.
Baltimore, Md.; he built barracks, he was a union member for 55 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he belong to any other clubs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes—he came from a town called Sokovosolover, Poland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know how to spell that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, we could never get it right, it’s a case of “Sokovosolover”—we
could never get it right, but there is a town there by that name and he was
born in that town. Let me explain this—his people, country people, came to
this country. From that particular stay, they formed this club. It was called
Verein, and it was a social meeting or group where all the people from this little
town and families would get together and there are still some in existence,
believe it or not, and probably in Chicago and I have a cousin, my father’s
nephew is still alive. His name is Abraham Rubenstein.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And this was a club formed in Chicago by the people of this
village who all came to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes—that’s right, they did come at different times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was a social and cultural get-together?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It was a social meeting club, where all the people from this little
town and their families could get together and there are still some in existence
believe it or not. And I have a cousin—my father’s nephew is still alive. His
name is Abraham Rubenstein by the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And this was a club formed in Chicago by the people of this
village who all wanted to enter into the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right—they had come at different times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was a social and a cultural proposition?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It was a get-together to know they are alive and they have
bought a cemetery where you can in due <span class="locked">time——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you attend any of the meetings?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there anything political about them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No—I’m going to tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, just tell me.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Honest to God, there wasn’t—they drank and they danced.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But would you answer my question as to whether or not there
was any political activity discussed—the answer is what—yes or no?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. You may write to the man—Abraham Rubenstein, he is still
alive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I just want to know whether your impression and your attendance
at the meetings of the club indicate to you whether this group at any
time had any political implication whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No, no; not that I would know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never observed any? Of any kind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you tell us something of Jack’s youth and education and
his childhood—you were older than he was and therefore, you are able to observe
it, I would think.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I am 2 years older and how far back do you want to go—do you
want me to go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of education did he have?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I think he went about a year and a half to high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were your parents separated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. My parents were separated—yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did they separate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. In the spring of 1921.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was when Jack was about 10 years old?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Let’s see, if he was born in 1911—yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who did Jack and you live with—your father or your mother?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, I went to live—my mother has—these people don’t live
there any more, in Maywood, Ill., my mother’s niece—the daughter of this
Sarah Moskowitz, Bertha Miller, I went to live with her for a while. Then
my father took an apartment, such as it was and I went to live with him for a
while, and—you want to know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about Jack himself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Now, this is something that there is a haziness about it—two
of my brothers were put on a farm with some people. It seems to me—I don’t
know which two—went to Woodstock, Ill., and one went to a place called West
Chicago or Chicago Heights and I have forgotten whether Jack was by himself
and Earl and Sammy went to a place. Then later on it seemed to me Jack
went to stay with a family, maybe a year later, called the Michelles—he admired
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, is it fair to state that apparently the family broke up; is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes—well, my mother had a nervous breakdown. That was
the first time, because of the dissension in the home because of my father’s activities
of drinking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is your father an alcoholic?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, he lived until 89—how can we prove it—you know, we
never knew if he was drunk or sober, but he drank plenty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did he die?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I would say in 1958 or 1959. I have just forgotten now, I’ll be
honest about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall whether Jack himself was involved in some sort
of juvenile court proceedings?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. We all were. In the State of Illinois, when parents separated,
I think there is such a thing as you are under the jurisdiction of the juvenile
court, because I went to court several times. I don’t think—I think I was
probably 12 or 13 years old—I don’t know. I remember going to a very famous
court and I can’t think of the judge’s name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, what I’m trying to get at is <span class="locked">this——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span> (interrupting). Not for being bad or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s exactly what I want to get at. In other words, these
juvenile court proceedings resulted, you say, from the mere fact that you had a
broken home and not from the <span class="locked">fact——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span> (interrupting). The Jewish Aid <span class="locked">Society——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just a minute, let me finish the question—this did not reflect
that the juveniles involved, whether it was you or <span class="locked">Jack——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Or anyone else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or anyone else had been in any trouble such as we call today—juvenile
delinquency; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your statement to me is that although you yourself have
been in these <span class="locked">proceedings——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span> (interrupting). I have been in front of the judge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It has not been because of juvenile delinquency; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, there was a <span class="locked">big——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just answer my question, I think you can answer my question.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I have been there several times in front of a judge and my mother
was there and the kids were there, and truthfully, it’s all so vague I can’t
remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember that in his youth Jack was called by the nickname
“Sparky”?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you tell us how he acquired that name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, there was a horse called “Sparky” that was the slowest
darn horse you ever saw and it was a joke, you know, in the funny papers, and
they would rib him about him. Jack was short and fat and stocky. He wobbled
when he walked, from the time I remember he was 5 years old, until the
time he was 8, and it seemed shortly after that he acquired that name and that
burned him up, and from then on he has become very fast with his fists and he
started hitting fellows—well—the fellows who probably kept calling him
“Sparky”, let’s say, but these were all little boys—8, 9, 11 or 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that’s how he got the name “Sparky”?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. As much as I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. From two sources—from the horse named “Spark Plug” or the
comic strip that had a horse named “Spark Plug” and from the fact that he, as a
child, reacted quickly to taunts of his young friends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, he changed, but the name stuck with him still.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; I understand that, but we are just talking about how he
acquired the name.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How would you describe the neighborhood in which you were
raised, generally, and the conditions under which you were generally raised?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, when you discuss people who come from the old country,
that was the best neighborhood they could afford to live in. Two doors down
were some very wealthy people—the Katzen family. My father was a carpenter
and he worked—he tried to work all the time. There wasn’t work always
available, but it was considered a poor neighborhood, but I’ll tell you—went with
him four blocks away to look over other neighborhoods.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, as you recall it now, would you classify it as a good neighborhood,
or a bad neighborhood, or what? Because, you see, we are trying to
get some background information here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Okay. We lived in a block where the houses have two-story buildings.
In one block between the both sides I will say there was 150 children between
the ages of 4 and 15, because these families have large groups and most
of the families have 6 children or 8 and some of them had 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You are familiar with the modern term “a slum neighborhood,”
would you characterize it like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Not really a slum because those who had more money next door
lived better, but there were worse neighborhoods. I don’t know how much worse.
I admit to you often we talked about it. I don’t say the middle class people
lived there. It was below the middle class, but yet it wasn’t the poorest class.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you marry, Mrs. Grant?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I married March 30, 1930, to Hyman Magid in Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I think there was a child born of this marriage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes; that’s Ronnie Magid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, that child is what age?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He will be 33 next month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were divorced from Mr. Magid?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I think it was 1934 in Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was Mr. Magid’s, your husband’s, occupation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, you really want to know—that’s a catchy question. He
went into business with his father and his father owned a meat market, but
that was later on. He really took up—he was a college graduate and he did
electrical work, but he never worked at it. He didn’t adapt himself to it for
some reason or other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did he do for a living, then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. As far as I know he was a butcher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I mean at that time.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He went to school when I married him and after that he worked
with his father.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In a butcher shop?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right, it was during the depression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where did you live during the time of your marriage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I lived with my mother-in-law on Kolin Avenue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In Chicago?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, after your divorce, I think you went to the west coast, is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Jack went there first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What year was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I think it was in 1934 in January, I mean, it seems to me it
was that year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had been divorced?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s when he went there. I didn’t go there until later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Jack went first?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes, he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he must have been a man about 21 or 22 at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It could be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This was in 1934?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Don’t hold me to 1934 or 1935. I’m so confused. I know it
was either one of the years, and he went there right after the first of the year,
and I followed 6 months later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know why he went there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes, he went to work. There was no work in Chicago and
there was boys out there that said there was jobs—that there was a lot of
jobs available in San Francisco.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you live with him when you went out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes—yes, I did; we occupied an apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was you and Jack and your son?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. My son—I put him in a private school and Jack helped me pay
for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was Jack’s occupation on the west coast?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He got a newspaper crew—sometimes he worked for the Call
Bulletin, which is a famous Hearst paper, the Examiner, and sometimes he
gave us the crew and he worked for the—there was a news—it was called the
San Francisco News and sometimes we worked for the Chronicle. You see,
there is a <span class="locked">system——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, when you say you worked for them, in what capacity?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. We solicited for subscriptions door to door. It was during the
height of the depression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This was sort of a door-to-door operation that you and he had,
was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, he was a better salesman. He was always guiding me,
you know, let me put it this way—there was good money in it considering the
times, because they were paying 90 cents an order and we would go out and
get 8 or 10 or 15 orders a day, which you couldn’t get in any other job, and
our obligations were great. My son’s expenses were $65 a month and my
brother helped support half of the fellows that didn’t work—who wouldn’t
do this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you say your “brother” you mean Jack?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I mean Jack—Jack was the only one out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you leave California?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, I married Frank Grant in San Francisco in 1936, and I
think we stayed around another year or a year and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But did you still reside with Jack then after you married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. For a while he did—yes, he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He lived with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. We had a four-room apartment and my son was home then
with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack have any other occupations during the time you were
on the west coast other than that which you have described?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I don’t remember out there anything but for the newspapers,
you know, and first he came to Los Angeles and he nearly starved to death. He
became a singing waiter and someone told him—well, he said he was on his way
to San Francisco but I think he didn’t have enough money or gas to get there—to
San Francisco.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you subsequently divorced from Frank Grant?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Now—I’m divorced many years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, ma’am; that’s what I wanted to get. When were you divorced?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I think I filed in 1941.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you left the west coast about what—1937?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No, I didn’t. I went down to Los Angeles with Frank Grant
and I lived there. I may have went home on a trip to Chicago, which I did
very often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you leave the west coast permanently?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I think it was after the war broke out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did Jack leave the west coast?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He already left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what year, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He may have left before 1940, but you see, he came back so many
times and he and a fellow by the name of Harry Epstein started to sell premium
items—a cedar chest with candy, if I remember, and they developed a company—I
think it was called the Spartan Co.—the Spartan Novelty Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was Jack and this fellow Epstein?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Harry Epstein—that’s as well as I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember any of these other friends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Who do you want me to remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t know—you see—you must tell me.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, you asked me—listen, I know all the fellows we knew in Chicago
and went to school with and grew up with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, perhaps you could name some of them that you remember.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, you see, there is a difference of friends and acquaintances.
There are people, you knew, that we just knew they existed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I think what we want to know is the friends, of course, a
lot of people you know, but those you would classify as being friends.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, he was an admirer of Barney Ross that was a good friend
all through the years and Barney fought on the west coast. They were very
close. Let’s see—while we were on the west coast we were very friendly with
Izzy Kaplan, with Frankie Goldstein—you see, these people all worked in the
newspaper—they were all working fellows at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were they from Chicago originally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; we met them out on the west coast soliciting for newspapers.
In Chicago I could name hundreds of fellows—I don’t know—Al Kamin,
do you know him—is he down on the list? He owned the Marlene Sales Co. at
one time and I think that at one time—now, let me tell you the story about him.
He and Jack were selling premiums and they went and made a plaque. They
invested every dime they could get from my family, which was $1,500—my sister
Marion and Earl—and this plaque, now, I don’t know if it was in that year or
when it was done, but it was President Roosevelt’s head and they figured for an
inducement to give away, that was a giveaway item. It was worth about $1 retail,
whoever wanted it, but they were selling merchandise and Al Kamin had a place
at 5 North Wabash or 5 South Wabash in Chicago. I don’t know—I was not
there at the time, but I do know this plaque thing existed and I know another
thing that they went into. You know, there were eight children and anyone who
had a buck in the family, they went into a deal where they made something about
this size [indicating], and it told about Pearl Harbor. I don’t know if you
remember seeing that plaque. They sold quite a bit of them, but to them it was
a giveaway. They sold quite a bit of merchandise—to induce these purchasers,
they would give them 10 or 15 of them. It was like a certificate that the people
shouldn’t forget Pearl Harbor. Now, that could have been—he wasn’t in the war
yet, where Earl and Sammy was already in. He went in, I think, the last one.
I may be wrong. I have forgotten—I’ll be honest about it, but they were merchandising
and this man and he were in business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, then did you move from the west coast back to Chicago
prior to Pearl Harbor; you did, did you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I was on the west coast—he was gone. He was in Chicago and
I think he was with Harry Epstein, I’m sure, in 1940 and in 1941 when the war
broke out. Now, he has been back to California. Other members of the family
came to visit my son and myself in 1940 and 1941, but he was already, I think,
established with Harry Epstein. Harry would know something more about this
than I do—I don’t remember, but I know they were selling merchandise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know of any acquaintenance or friends that Jack had
who had been convicted of crimes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Name them—I’ll admit to it if I know—yes—let me say this, we
knew undesirable characters that grew up in our neighborhood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You remember some of their names?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you state them, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I don’t want it to be in the public library. These fellows are
such nice fellows today, I heard. You know, if these things get out, they think
we are degrading them. We were raised with a lot of people that become undesirables.
They were people that lived in our neighborhood. Some went to
school with us. I know of a fellow getting killed—he said his name was English—he
was a bad character as far as we knew. He was 16 years old and I
think they killed him on a swing somewhere in the area. We knew the family
where they had three boys and I understand—I’m going to tell you about this
family, because I told the Secret Service, Elmer Moore. His name was Lenny
Patrick. Let me explain—we knew he existed. We never associated with
him in our home or in our business or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s what I wanted to ask you. You see, I have asked you if
these people were your friends or not.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; but they are people we know. We know their family—we
see them, “How’s your mother, how’s your sister?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But there was no close relationship between Jack and people
with criminal records, is that right? Is that a fair statement?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. If he knew any—maybe—I don’t know whoever went to jail—all
of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I’m asking you what you know about it. Let me put it this
way: Do you know of any people who were friendly with Jack, not merely knew
him, but who were friendly with Jack, who you knew and he knew had a criminal
record?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, I wouldn’t say he was unfriendly with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I didn’t ask you that—I’m asking you—was he friendly with
any of them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, he wasn’t associated socially or in business, yet you saw
them—they were around. If you went to a nightclub or if you went to a bazaar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I mean did they come to the home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they come and visit you and such as that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. May I inject something in there—Jack didn’t visit in their
home and they didn’t visit in yours and you didn’t have anything to do with
them; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Even their sisters or brothers who were nice, we didn’t have
anything to do with them, yet we knew they turned out to be some pretty rough
characters and I’m not going to deny that—Sam Yeres and Dave Yeres—let me
say this, I knew of more than he knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know of any contacts that he may have retained with any
of these people after he left the Chicago area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. We saw them—and we encountered them—we talked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did they come to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, no—nobody I know. I know one did—wait a minute—Sam
Yeres did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did he come to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I don’t know—many years ago, but he is since dead and his
brother is in Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s take the last 8 or 9 or 10 years.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He may have died 10 years ago, for all I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know of any people of the nature or character which you
have described whom Jack may have known in the Chicago district whom he
contacted or who contacted him in the past 10 years—to your knowledge—if you
don’t know, you don’t know.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. If they have, I didn’t know they were here, but I doubt if he
would be friendly with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The answer is that you really don’t know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I really don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you want to ask anything about this segment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Yes, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant, your father only had one brother, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He had a lot of brothers—they died in the old country. The only
brother that came here as far as I knew was that one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Was the one you told us about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, the juvenile court contacts that you and your brothers
and sisters had were all a result of a broken home and not as a result of any type
of misbehavior?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. There has never been any criminal action in my family as much
as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, as to Jack’s recent last 10 years, you know of no contacts
he has had either in person or by <span class="locked">telephone——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I want to correct that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. With any person of an undesirable or criminal element?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, the way you look at it—now, the AGVA is a highly recognized
organization in the world—it is the Actor’s Guild and Jack had a lot of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
trouble here with certain other nightclub owners. We had known that a certain
individual has upped himself up from racketeering to this particular organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Who is that individual, do you know that individual’s name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Now, as I know him, he used to be a cocktail lounge owner and he
is in that slip. His name is Jack Yanover. We know his parents—I’ve known
the man 40 years. He’s a man 65 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. He had some type of criminal element?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Let me tell you—to get into these union deals and everything,
Jack—by the way you know Jack was a union organizer and became an officer,
but the man he was connected with was a highly reputable lawyer. That’s why
they killed him—Leon Cook. Jack himself never had any connections with
gangsters for money, for business, for sociability. On the other hand, when we
saw them we acknowledged them. When my father <span class="locked">died——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, let me bring you up to the last 10 years—do you know of
any telephone contacts Jack has had?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. With whom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Here—I’m going to tell you—in the last year he has had so much
aggravation in the club, that he called this Lenny Patrick. That was the last
resort. He figured he might know somebody—this guy is not a holy man by far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Lenny Patrick is not a holy man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No: he’s not by far. He’s a gambler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Jack called him for what purpose?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He called him for the purpose to see if he could fix him up with
the union, so he could have amateur night the same as the other two fellows here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. It’s something to do with unions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, let me ask you this—what about this friend of Jack’s—this
Willie, do you know this man; what do you know about him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Willie—he is <span class="locked">considered——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How is it spelled?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. [Spelling] M-c-W-i-l-l-i-e.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, that’s Louis McWillie, is that who you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I met him 8 or 9 years ago in the restaurant with Jack, and Jack
told me that night or the next night that, “He’s a gambler,” in fact, I think he was
the main guy at the high class club here, Cipango’s, he ran games over there
at that club and it is highly recognized, and the town sort of overlooks him and
they admire him—truthfully, if you met this man, you would think he is a doctor
or a lawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Jack has had some contact with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; not in business. He was a nice fellow. I don’t know how
well Jack knew him—I do know this man was getting a divorce. He was married
to a much older lady and he went to Jack—he wanted Jack to talk to this
lady to be sure she files a divorce, something to that effect, because I went with
him to her home. He wasn’t there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Jack also had contact by going on vacations with him, for
instance?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well; wait a minute. Jack was broke, as you know. That’s
another thing, and he was so disgusted and so blue and it seemed it was the
year my father was very ill, I think it was 1958, and that McWillie sent him
a ticket to come to Havana, Cuba, and my sister was there—not the same time,
but the same year, but there was no commotion with Havana, Cuba, then, and
McWillie—the airlines has proved that this ticket was bought by this McWillie—that’s
as much as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. He went down there and was it for some type of business that
they had talked about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I’ll tell you—I understand—now, this was told to me recently
and I don’t even know if it’s so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. It wasn’t told to you by Jack?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I don’t even know who told me—it’s something about jeeps
and I don’t know if I’m dreaming it or thinking it. McWillie was a gambler<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
and they are running a game in the big casinos where all the bigwigs out of
Miami come over for a couple of nights, and that was as much as I knew about
it because I have never been to Florida or to that part of Florida.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, as far as you know, Jack and McWillie never had any
business relationship, McWillie was just helping Jack out on a vacation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, Jack was depressed and sick mentally then and we didn’t
realize it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Is that about the time he locked himself up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; he locked himself up before that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Do you think of any other person or any other incident or
anything else that you know concerning Jack and having any connection in
the last 10 years with any one of the so-called criminal element?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Now, I know he went to New York to talk to a guy by the name
of Glazer, but he is considered the wealthiest booking agent, and from what I
heard years ago, this guy probably could have been in rackets—I don’t know,
but he is with the AGVA. I can’t explain this—some of these boys have worked
themselves up <span class="locked">to——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. So that the only contacts that you do know about were
through AGVA, or what you have already told us?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. There was nothing—I know when Lenny—he said something
about “Maybe he knows somebody in the AGVA.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Who could help them in the trouble he was having?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right. He also called—there was a fellow in Chicago
by the name of—I have noticed all their names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. But this is all you can think about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. But if they have got names, I will answer it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right, we will get to that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I am not trying to get out of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. This is all you can think of now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Let me explain something before you even—and since this is
going in this record—I knew more racketeers than he did. My girl friends
lived in classy buildings and there were fellows that worked, they were
gambling men. The ran districts in Chicago and when I was 16 or 18, this was
the prohibition. We hear all of this stuff and we were intrigued by it, but we
didn’t know who these people were, but I knew they existed, and truthfully,
all in 1 year—in the early forties they were, as you say, bumped off, but he
didn’t know them, and please believe me I am very truthful and very honest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s go off the record now and recess until this evening.</p>

<p>(Discussion between counsel off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We will recess until 7:30 this evening.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, the proceeding was recessed.)</p>

<h3>TESTIMONY OF MRS. EVA GRANT RESUMED</h3>

<p>The proceeding was reconvened at 7:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I understand that you returned to Chicago to live some time
prior to the war, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Let’s see—every year I went home—I may have stayed a month,
3 months or 4 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I mean on a permanent basis.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I was never there permanent after I married Frank Grant. I
mean, if I was there—the longest time I was there is the year my father was
sick before he died.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right; let me put it this way—I am going to ask you if you
know some names of people and if you don’t know them, all right, but if you
do know them, tell us what you know about them. For instance, Frank Howard
and Jack Howard—do you know those people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; I don’t, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And a man by the name of Erwin Berke [spelling] B-e-r-k-e.
Do you know him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Never—just doesn’t ring a bell, I never have heard the name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Sam Jaffe [spelling]
J-a-f-f-e?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Sam Chavin [spelling]
C-h-a-v-i-n?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Perhaps you knew his wife, Charlotte Chavin, who is the daughter
of Sam Jaffe, did you ever see her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Where are they from; do you have an idea?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They were from Chicago, ma’am, and they subsequently moved to
Muncie, Ind.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I never heard of them—I never heard of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never heard of them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever know of any connection that Jack might have had
with those people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It wasn’t a close connection. We knew some Jaffes—I mean, as
kids—they were in the undertaking business, but I haven’t heard of them in
years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know a daughter of Sam Jaffe whose name was Charlotte
and she married Sam Chavin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No, sir; I can’t recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then there was another daughter who married Erwin Berke.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. What was her first name? Can I ask you a question—how far
back does the names go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This would have been around the period of the war—1942 to
1946.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I wasn’t around Chicago that much in those years—you see—I
was here and on the west coast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, these names don’t ring a bell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No, sir; I can’t place them at all unless they are mispronounced
or misspelled, but Jaffes—I did know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know any Jaffes who moved from Chicago to Muncie,
Ind.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The Jaffes you did know were in an earlier period; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And as far as you know, they didn’t move to Muncie, Ind.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. In the last 25 years—I can’t place the name close to Jack or me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about Paul Labriola [spelling] L-a-b-r-i-o-l-a?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about Hershey Colvin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I never heard those names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Jimmy Weinberg?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. We are—my mother had a niece that was married to a Weinberg,
but there is not one name like that in the family—no Jimmies.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you did, of course, move ultimately to Dallas, which has
been your home, I take it, for some period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. On and off for over 20 years—22 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you first come to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I think it was in 1942 or 1943, I was here for a little while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. For how long?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. For a few months at least it seems.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the purpose of coming here to Dallas; do you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, I came to look—Al Kamin owned the Marlene Sales
and he had costume jewelry and he wanted me to sell it, you know, in little
stores and I took a sample and I didn’t sell it. I had several samples and I
went to work selling magazines for a company, it seems, out of Los Angeles—I
don’t know what year it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This was in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes; but I mean this particular agency handles all magazines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did you stay in Dallas during that period?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It seems a couple of months—I don’t know—then, I went home.
You see, I think it was during the summer—I left my son there in the summer—I
just can’t remember—honest to God.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Weren’t you in some sort of an export-import business?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes; but that was later—I think it was in 1944, 1945, 1946,
and 1947.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, you were living in Dallas on a rather permanent basis
during those years?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. After that—yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, I gather from your testimony you would fix a time of your
permanent domicile or residence in Dallas as about 1944?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It seems to me I stayed more here—then. I was here—I would
think 3 or 4 years. Even if I went to Chicago I didn’t stay long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand, but your home in the normal sense of the word
would have been Dallas after 1944?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I would say from that time on I was just here until 1948, constantly,
well, I mean outside of every year—leaving for a few weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, now—what was the export-import business?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. We really didn’t do any exporting. That was the name of the
Berger-Grant Sales Co. Milton Berger was with me—he has since died. We
bought and sold caustic soda, soda ash, and my brother Jack made a connection
for me to sell irons—regular household irons and lamps and merchandise,
but he knew a factory in Chicago and they sent me merchandise and Milton
went on the road and through seven or eight States in the South and I handled
the business end of it—that was caustic soda, soda ash, and we had a few
accounts—the best account I remember is the Rivera people—the Rivera family.
They bought soda ash and caustic soda from us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who were they?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, Jerry Rivera, his home is in Piedras Negras—they are still
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In what State—in what country?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Isn’t that right over the border in Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t know—Piedras Negras—is that it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It’s in Mexico?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; but he lived in San Antonio a great deal and in Houston
he had an office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is he alive?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was the last contact with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I think I saw him about 4 years ago—maybe 5.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what connection, do you recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, he came through—he was at one of the motels and he called
my brother and I went out and had dinner with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He called Jack, you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes—now, there are several brothers in the family, and I even
met his parents the previous year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall any connection with that Rivera family or any
member of it in the last 4 or 5 years?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; but I do know I met his mother and father. They came to
Chicago in one of the summers—like in the middle fifties when I was up there.
They had called our home in Chicago and his parents were staying at the Palmer
House.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know of any connection whatsoever between your brother,
Jack Ruby, and any member of the Rivera family in the last 4 or 5 years?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I don’t think he had any business with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or any connection otherwise?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He only knew them through me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know of any connection in any way—business, social,
or otherwise, in the last 5 years?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Nothing—nothing. I am here now exactly a little over 4 years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
and I have not left this city for 4 years, outside of going to Hot Springs once
for 3 days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Paul Roland Jones?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you tell us what you know about him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I was going with a fellow by the name of Dr. Weldon Duncan.
This fellow was here in town, at least he was 2 weeks ago—now—he is a chiropractor
and he knew this Roland Jones and Roland told me—that’s it. He told
me he was in the export business, not in the export business exactly, wait a
minute—brokerage business—of eggs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you meet Paul Roland Jones first?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. When I knew him well was before you see, we didn’t have
enough money to open the club. Jack was still in the service and Jack says
he will sell his interest in the Earl Products—he was in business with the other
brothers, do you have it there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. OK—well, Jack says when he gets out of this he will send me some
money and that could have been the fall or summer of 1947. That seems to
be it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell me how you got to meet him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, Dr. Duncan brought him over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As a friend or in what way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. They came to the club—I mean—just came to that club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which club was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It was called the Singapore Supper Club at 1717 South Ervay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were running that club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; the club was not open—we didn’t have chairs or tables.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, they came to this place then that was called the Singapore
Club that was not yet open?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. And I used the office of the club for my other merchandise
business. In fact, the club was full with lamps and all other kinds of things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And this doctor introduced you to Roland Paul Jones?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever have any further connections with Roland Paul
Jones?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us about that, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. We were buying metals, at least we were trying to buy metals
and materials to sell to—in fact, gas companies—one is—I have the files, believe
me, and I think it’s at Jonesboro—is it in Arkansas or Oklahoma? Well, we
got the specifications and Paul Roland Jones brought me a piece of metal,
maybe 6 inches long—it’s a certain type of pipe, rather, he brought me, and this
man didn’t want it, so I sent it on to Chicago to my brother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which brother?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It seems to me I sent it to my older brother, Hyman, and he
says he knew somebody that might be able to use the amount of footage we
had at this place, and we were going to make what you call a finder’s fee or
broker’s fee, but little did we know of Paul Roland Jones’ connection, because
I’m going to tell you. This man told me several things—“I’m not fit to be in
the night club business, I’m not the caliber of a person.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was that—Jones told you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; and he seemed to be a very nice fellow and he used my
phone for a long distance call to Ardmore, Okla., and I know he paid me $2
or $3 in change when he did it, and I didn’t know a thing about this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what, ma’am?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, wait a minute, I pick up the headlines and they got Paul
Roland Jones in jail somewhere—in Fort Worth. I no sooner picked this up—this
paper, the paper of this city, my brother is calling me from Chicago that the
FBI or some organization, one of your organizations went to the Congress Hotel
where Jack was staying and they are questioning him about whether—about
what he knew about Paul Roland Jones. I don’t think Jack ever heard me
mention the name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long had you known Paul Roland Jones when this occurred?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Not too many months—if it was 6 months or 8 months—it was
the longest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you done any business with him?</p>

<p>Mrs Grant. No—never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was simply through meeting at the club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, this doctor brought him in one afternoon. He knew him
because he went to him for treatment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, that’s the first meeting, but thereafter, what was the
basis of the meeting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Nothing. I mean, he came in, and I went to dinner with him
and the doctor once, and we went for a ride, but I’ll tell you, the doctor and
I didn’t know anything about his background.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was ultimately charged, was he not, with the possession of
narcotics?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes; in fact, we read the story that night. We were shocked.
We knew he took trips, we knew he was married to a dancer in New York,
but this all came out—wait a minute, his wife came from New York that summer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, we’ll get into that later. Did Jack know Paul Roland
Jones at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. If he did—no; I doubt if he ever even heard of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Jack had not come down here yet?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. If he was, he didn’t stay long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But to your recollection he didn’t know Jones at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I don’t think he has ever seen him—well, wait a minute, he
may have seen the man or heard about him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand that, but at the time of this episode that you are
telling us about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I don’t think he ever saw him as far as I know, but I want to
tell you that Roland Jones went to Chicago during the period of those 6 months
and he did meet my brother Hyman. I don’t know what conversation my
brother had—my brother thought he was a nice guy—we didn’t know anything
about his background.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what happened to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes; he went to jail for something about narcotics from
Turkey or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have any other charges later against him? Do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Do you want to know something—I went into a hotel here, and
let me think, either the Whitmore or the Southland since he has been out, or
when he got out, and this friend of mine said, “Guess who got out of jail?”
He said “Paul Roland Jones,” and I said, “That’s nice.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long ago was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. This must be 7 years or 8 years—it seems like a long time ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you seen him since?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; he was here 2 years ago, I think. He came through and
he stopped by the Vegas Club one night. Oh, he says, he got in a cab and he
was coming through—he probably was here other times but he didn’t want
anybody to know—he said he was coming through changing planes and he
says he’s sure going to be picked up and he says to say hello to Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Maybe a year and a half or 2 years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him in November 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you talk to him on the phone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know he was in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs Grant. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is there anything you know that would indicate that your brother,
Jack, knew he was in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In November 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I don’t know. I’ll tell you how I figure this out, if I can go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
see my contract—you see, my band leader was making a record, you know,
a record of music.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But so far as your recollection is concerned, it would be over
a year from today?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Easy—easy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And by “contact with him,” of course, I mean—you know—telephone,
letters, messages?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; he came in—he told me that he knows people at Mercury
Records and that if I send in the song he was going to make it, and truthfully,
I was glad when he came in, when he left, for more reasons than one. We
don’t discuss his background or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, that’s over a year ago—certainly.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It has been so long—I say a year and a half—the airlines would
know quicker than I know because he said he just flew in and he was just
there for the evening and going back out, at least that’s what he told me. I
don’t discuss his background or anything like that—at least, that’s what he
told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Taylor Crossley?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. What is the first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Taylor [spelling] T-a-y-l-o-r.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I know a lot of Taylors here but that is the last name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; Crossley. John Melton, and Morris Melton [spelling]
M-e-l-t-o-n?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, do you know a person by the name of Elsie Johnson?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, 8 or 9 years ago she was in the building business with
my brother, Sam. Before that—she was a commercial artist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you meet her—when did you meet her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. When I first came here, and honest to God, this is one person I
can’t tell you even how I met her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you first came here—when do you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I would say 20 years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. 1944—probably?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; and let me tell you, she knew a girl, Bobby, whether I met
Bobby first—she’s a little girl that worked as a cashier at one of the theatres
and was it that she introduced me to Bobby—I knew her very well and her
sister and her mother and her brothers, and she became a preacher. She
ordained herself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is she a friend of yours?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, I don’t know if she is an enemy—I just don’t know—it has
been years since I have seen her. I spoke to her on the phone. It seemed to
me she called me November 24, that afternoon, or her sister did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is her sister?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Mary Sue Brown, and I think she worked at Green’s Department
Store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you knew Mary Sue Brown also?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes; I knew the family. I used to go out there like maybe
once a year—Elsie had a car and she would drive me to her mother’s home, which
is Mrs. Barnes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do they still live in the Dallas area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I’m sure they do—I probably have their phone number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And your thought is that the last time you heard from them
was that there was a call from Elsie?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. How sorry she was about my brother—it was on November the
24th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was the last contact you had with her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; I saw Mary, let’s see, I saw Mary Sue—I went to one of the
stores—I think it was H. L. Green’s and she was waiting on the people, I mean,
she was a saleswoman in the store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that’s since?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I haven’t seen Mary Sue for maybe a year and a half previously
or Elsie, maybe, I don’t think I have seen Elsie since I am back this time—3
or 4 years—I can’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was there any difficulty between you and Elsie concerning some
ring?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; the other sister.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mary Sue Brown?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Mary Sue Brown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, she used to come over and stay overnight and I have this
diamond ring yet, and it had a little stone in there my mother had given me.
There were many stones—from two marriage rings, and a fellow gave me a little
stone and my mother’s little—you know, a little diamond—little diamonds.
I went to take a bath and I had my money in this purse and it’s a terrible
thing—very terrible—it kills me to this day even thinking about it—she was
going to stay another day, and I knew how much money I had on me the day
before and I bought a little dress and some things I bought. I took her to
dinner and stuff like that. She managed to wiggle out of not staying any
more. She was very nervous, and that night I get to the club and I put my
ring out and you could see the prongs were bent back—the stone was missing,
the center stone, which was about, a third of a carat. I called some friends
of <span class="locked">mine——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long ago was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I think it’s a year and a half—maybe 2 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, go on.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I just don’t remember. Anyway, I called—the vice squad came
in very often to the club and I was really very friendly with a fellow by the
name of Mike, and I don’t remember who he had with him, and they took the
ring to the laboratory—they proved that someone had—I can’t explain it—they
<span class="locked">said——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They said that they had taken the stone out by force?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; something like that. Anyway, the thing is, any other thing
I wouldn’t have cared about, but that stone, my mother gave me and she swore
she didn’t do anything about it, but I’ll tell you, there was some money missing
out of my purse and I never felt right about it, and her nervousness in getting
out of the apartment and all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You made no charges?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; I just wished the whole thing hadn’t happened, but I told
her I wanted the stone back. I didn’t care about the money—I just was sick.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had you during the war done any kind of trading in sugar
stamps?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s not true?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; I never had any extra stamps outside of what my family
had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever boast to anyone or say to anyone in any way that
you had connections with the Capone gang?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Aw—let me tell you, when I came to <span class="locked">Dallas——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Just answer the question.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No, sir. And it just kills me—connections—I had no connections.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know of a Lois, or perhaps it’s Louis Green?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Now, I didn’t know him. He was in this town. The conversation
was great about him. He did not know me—he wouldn’t know me if he
saw me and I understand he’s dead. There was absolutely—the man never even
talked to me. I wouldn’t know him—short, tall, or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You never met him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; not to my knowledge—no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know the circumstances of his death?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I don’t think I was here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he die—how long ago, do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I really don’t know, but I was hurt—you know what I mean—there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
were certain individuals I read about in the papers. I know he was considered
a character.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, he was with the rough element—he never worked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In Dallas, you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. In Dallas—he was a Dallas man, as much as—-you know, when
you are in the night club business, you see a lot of undesirable people, but you
are not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Tell us how you got into the night club business yourself.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, when I was on the west coast I ran a restaurant in back
of a bar and it seemed to be quite a lucrative business. That was Frankie
Nolan’s place on Sunset Boulevard. Now, whether that was the second place or
the first place—I don’t know, but then I once went with a fellow, Harvey
Brooker, and his mother had a restaurant and I learned to manage that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was in San Francisco?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; it was in Los Angeles—both these places were in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I was thinking particularly about the Dallas area.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Then, when I came here and I worked for Harvey Phillips, the
Southwest Tool &amp; Die Co., some real estate man who he was acquainted with,
Fred Shinskey, said, “You know, I know a good spot where the landlord wants to
build a restaurant and night club,” and Jack got money from the Earl Products—and
sent me $1,100 and I think that was the amount, to put the money
down on the lease—the first and the last months of a 10-year lease. Mr. Waddlington,
who owned the ground, had built the inside of the building—no; the
outside of the building, and part of the inside to my specifications and the idea
was that Jack—Jack was in the service but he was very unhappy in being in
business with my two brothers, and they sent me some money. I think they
sent me—one brother sent me $1,500 and my older brother—with the things he
bought and paid for ran about $2,500—like dishes and intercom system and a
grand piano—ran to about $2,500—and this is <span class="locked">Hyman——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And <span class="locked">so——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Wait a minute, and I went into business then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That became known as what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That became known as the Singapore Supper Club for a little
over a year, and it was a very sad—it was too nice a club for that part of town
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, did Jack join you in that venture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes; he was a partner in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he actually helped operate it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; listen, I want to tell you, he did all the operating, and the
truth of the matter is, had he not known how bad that neighborhood was—you
see, I didn’t know, because I didn’t mingle with anybody and I didn’t
understand about certain—what they call the tenderloin district, I never heard
the word. He was mad that I got involved in that with so much money and then
all this work—this struggle for 2 years—It took 2 and 2½ years or 3 years
until they built the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He came in what year—Jack did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He came right after he got out of service and it seems to me
it was in 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he stayed with you running this club for some time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I left shortly. I went on the road—I went on the west coast
and I was selling fishing tackle for Harvey Phillips, and then I got another
line—of radios.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, is it fair to say then that when Jack came, you left—just
about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, shortly after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You sold out to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; I just gave him power of attorney. It’s my brother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he invested $1,100?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, he invested a lot more—he got more money out of what
he sold out of his business in Chicago and I don’t know how much his end of
the Earl Products came to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He sold or closed the Singapore Supper Club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He changed the name to the Silver Spur because that name would
fit better in that area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And did you have an interest in the Silver Spur?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He sent me some money when I was broke or sick or I didn’t work
or the weather was too hot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you didn’t have any financial interest in the Singapore Club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, I put in money because I made money in the brokerage
business. Every time I made money, I would throw it back in—I put it back in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, what was the arrangement between you and Jack as to
the ownership of the Silver Spur?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. We were partners.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Half and half?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; but there was never any half and half. I can’t explain it.
He was there and things were so bad, we were lucky we were eating. That’s
one of the reasons I left and went out to the west coast on the road with the
fishing tackle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you stayed away from Dallas as I understand it, until
approximately 1959, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, no; I was here lots of times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I understand that, but I mean—you didn’t come back
here to live on a permanent basis?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I was here—I was here the next year—the year after that, and
I stayed 2 years and he got involved with another club that a fellow was
wanting to sell it and it was called Hernando’s Hideaway and I think that
was in 1952 or 1953, and by then—Jack always had his hands in two or three
places—whether they are making money or not, and I ran this other club, if I
remember, and then I ran the Vegas Club for a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you came back to Dallas, so that it was on a permanent
basis, in what year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I don’t know how long I was here then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But I think you mentioned a little while ago that you haven’t
been out of town—out of this town for 4 or 5 years?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Now, I am here 4 years constantly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s what I am talking about.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. But this time I was gone about a year and a half or 2, but I
have been back here, but I didn’t come to stay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s what I understand, so that during the period from 1948
to roughly 1958, a period of 10 years, you were in and out of Dallas, of course?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, you didn’t have any connection with any of Jack’s operations
here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, in the early fifties when I came, I worked at the Vegas
Club and as I said, I ran this Hernando’s Hideaway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know the circumstances of Jack’s acquisition of the Vegas
Club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Could you tell us briefly how that came about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I know this, that he sold the other club—I may be wrong—for
$4,500. I don’t know the exact amount—but I have an idea it was around $4,500
and he bought this club with a couple other fellows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I never met them—I know I heard the name Joe Bonds—I never
saw him in my life. Maybe if I saw him I didn’t know it was him. When I came
he was in jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about Martin Gimpel or Marty Gimpel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, Marty, may he rest in peace, is a real nice guy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He’s dead now, isn’t he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes—he worked for the Post Office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He has been dead some time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Not over 2½ years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he in the Vegas Club?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It seems to me he may have been in with Jack and maybe
even—you see, there was a time he may have even taken over—Jack let him
take over the Silver Spur and Jack went into a business called—the club—does
it say Bob Wills’ Ranch House there, something like that, anything about
Bob Wills’ Ranch House?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No, ma’am. Did he have some interest in that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes, and it’s here in town—it’s not that name any more. Jack,
I think, leased or sold the Silver Spur to Marty and it was Marty that was
running the club and Jack was running the Bob Wills’ Ranch House with
somebody else—oh, yes, I know the guy—Hyman Fader, or something like
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Isn’t it a fact that for the last 2 or 3 years you have operated
the Vegas Club for Jack?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes, three and a half years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you have been I take it, on a salaried basis?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have no ownership in the club, though, I take it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But did you have complete management and control?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, let me put it this way—every week I would give him—like
if I would have $800 and he said he needed $600 to pay bills or $400, he
would take it. I make the payroll, I pay the bills and I didn’t go to the Federal
to pay the taxes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, let me put it this way—you used your gross receipts, I
suppose, to pay the running expenses?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right, and when he would take any money, he would take
a lump; you know what I mean, 400 or 500, not if he made 2¼, did he take 2¼.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you keep any books on the transactions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes—what is his name—Abe Kleinman—of course, I don’t
have them—I have some of the things, but Abe Kleinman was the accountant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You didn’t own the land or the building of the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, no—no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much rent was paid; do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. 500—since I’m there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. $500 a month?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. $500 a month, but I think the first year that I was there, I think
it was only 400 and something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All of the help, I take it, was paid in cash?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes, but everyone who signed checks. You know—I would make
out a check—I would take out their withholding and social security and put it
right on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You used a bank then for the operation of the Vegas Club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. We had a bank account.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But did you pay salaries and other expenses?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I paid the band and I paid the bartender and I paid a floorman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What bank was that with?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. The Merchants’ State Bank.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had a checking account there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No, I didn’t. He did. But what I mean is, the checks didn’t
go through the bank. We just let them sign a check like a receipt, but everything
was on it—their names, their withholding and their social security.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s what I was trying to get at—the Vegas Club or Jack
Ruby or you, yourself, for the operation of the Vegas Club, did not have an
active checking account in which money received was deposited and expenses
paid out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He deposited the money every week, but it was like a round
figure, like 200. I paid for the gas, I paid the telephone and lights and water
bill on checks. I bought all the merchandise on cash and we have receipts.
He paid the rent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you paid the employees by cash, too?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. The bartender, and the band and the floorman. The waitresses
worked on tips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All the employees were paid by cash?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes, but they signed receipts for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand. Who was Pauline Hall in that operation, what
did she have to do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, sometimes she helped on the floor as a hostess and, of
course, while I was ill, she took over the management for 2 weeks in 1963 in
November. She has been a waitress in our club on and off. She has known
us about 8 years. She has been a bartender when we needed one—she is a very
nice person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand you had some trouble with your band at the Vegas
in the fall—did they quit or something of that sort?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, we had the same band leader—yes—almost 8 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Joe Johnson.</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, he was unhappy because someone offered him more money.
We weren’t getting along, he and I, and there was always a dissension. First
of all, he wouldn’t stay on the bandstand—I had to humor him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, did he quit or did you fire him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No, we didn’t fire him. He made arrangements with another
night club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was when?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He made arrangements unbeknownst to us, but he gave us
notice and he left, I think, the first week of November, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about Raymond Jones, do you know him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He worked at the Vegas, didn’t he?</p>

<p>Mrs <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He worked on and off—he was a porter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was a handyman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I beg your pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He was a handyman or a porter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He was a porter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He quit the Vegas, didn’t he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; he has always had another job and he worked for me and
he came back—he wasn’t a very good porter. Truthfully, where he worked the
last job for 19 years, he didn’t do actually any porter work—he was like the
foreman over porters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, did he stop working for the Vegas at any particular date
so that you didn’t see him thereafter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, he came back a couple of times—Jack knew him from the
Dallas Athletic Club. That’s how I got him in the first place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, did he quit working for you back last fall sometime?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, call it quits—he quit a few times, I called him and he
came; he is not the most intellectual man; he can’t read or write; he can’t
sign his own name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, in any case, he stopped working for you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, I fired him a couple of times and he came back. I don’t
know how you would—it isn’t any quitting—he never showed up. In fact,
he worked for me right around New Year’s again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had nothing to do, as I understand, with the operation
of the Sovereign Club or the Carousel, but perhaps you can tell us something
about how those two clubs came into existence and what you know about them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, first, I wasn’t in town to begin with, and when I did
arrive here, that club was in existence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Which one was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That was the Sovereign Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s on Commerce Street, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. 1312½ Commerce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It’s an upstairs location?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. And I understand Jack has taken money from Earl and probably
from my sister Mary and God knows who else in the family—there was none of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
his money in there—if he had a thousand dollars of his money, it was a lot of
money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that a corporation, to your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who are the owners of the stock?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, from what I knew—Ralph Paul put in some money and
that was another thing. He is quite a well-to-do man and I think he wanted
Jack to be a success, whether he loaned or gave him money—I don’t know, but
I know he was connected with the club, and Leo Torti, I think Jack owed him a
little. Jack promised or owed him some money, made him part of the corporation
and the first that started out it was with Earl being in it, but the State
doesn’t allow an outsider to be in a corporation of that type when you carry a
liquor license and I think they rehashed it later on and it went over a few
times—it started out with the people I didn’t know, but ones I got to know later
on was Joe Slayton and another fellow who I still don’t know who he is. There
was three partners—Jack represented Earl, Earl gave him the money. Jack
encouraged Earl to give him the money to go into this thing and to this day,
and this is truthfully, I think he owes Earl $8,500 on that deal alone, and I’m
making it low. I don’t know all the money Earl had given him from time to time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know of the existence of a corporation called Sovereign,
Incorporated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; it’s called S &amp; R Corp. or R &amp; S. Yes; I know it now and
I knew it when I came to town. He told me about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But did you ever hear of a corporation called Sovereign Club,
Incorporated, or Inc.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It could be the same club if it is. Now, since then Ralph was so
disgusted when Jack got in all this trouble, he gave me the stock—his stock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he own that stock that you’ve got—do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I guess so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He gave you the certificates, you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; there’s no name on them—I have it at home—I think it says
500 shares.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The name was just in blank?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, he didn’t have to endorse it over to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I told him we were going to sell it and he said, “You endorse it
over to the other person.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But he did not endorse it over, he just gave you the certificates?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, he had a letter with the attorney—they went up to an attorney
called Graham Koch [spelling] K-o-c-h. Anyway, he would know more
about it than I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whether Ralph Paul was holding that stock as
owner or as security for money owed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Who knows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But do you know that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I know Ralph must have given Jack a lot of money that he never
got back; believe me, let me tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Had Jack talked to you at all about any nightclubs that he proposed
to open?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did he first talk to you about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Listen, now, he didn’t say he was going to open it, he says,
“This would be a good private club,” and I think he took me then on a street
here to Maple or Cedar Springs, and I guess he was going to ask Ralph Paul
for money, to be honest, they were very close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you to be a part of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, he didn’t tell me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How far had those plans gone, do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I looked at the outside of the building with him late at night—3
o’clock in the morning. Now, wait a minute, he had seen it—he had been in it—whatever
this building is, and to this day I’d like to find it because someone else
told me that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know when that was that he showed that building to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It seemed to me that it was in the summer and once early in the
fall, or it could have been in October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say what he was going to do with the Vegas and
the Carousel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He didn’t say anything about the Vegas or the Carousel, but
I’ll tell you, the Carousel in my estimation wasn’t making any money and it
made him sick, and one of the reasons was he said that all the other clubs that
sell liquor over the bar—you see, this State has very peculiar liquor laws and
he said with a downtown club he could get a lot of members to go into this
private club, but he did look at this building a few times because he talked about
it and he is the biggest planner you’ve ever seen about something that don’t
develop in his mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, does the name Gene Schriver [spelling] S-c-h-r-i-v-e-r,
mean anything to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Is that a girl or a fellow; do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, we knew a Jean that worked for him as a waitress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is the last name Schriver?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Not that I know of. I knew a lot of girls that worked for
them but I didn’t know their last names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of work did she do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. She was a waitress up there—a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did she stay?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, she was there two or three times. She got mad at Jack
and went over and worked for the Colony Club, if it’s the same little girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was she working with Jack at the time of the death of the
President?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Gee, I don’t know; I don’t remember who was working there.
I know one cute little girl and I couldn’t think of her name unless it came up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about Frank Goldstein?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, he used to work with him selling subscriptions in San
Francisco and when Jack was having trouble with the union—he hasn’t spoken
to that fellow in 26 years and I believe it, because I’ve been on the west coast
off and on, and Frank often asks, “Why don’t you write to me or call?” Last
fall, in fact, in November—as late as November, I think Jack made the first call
to Frank Goldstein because things were getting very bad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In your opinion, that phone call made to Goldstein was the first
connection between Jack and <span class="locked">Goldstein——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Wait a minute, let me finish my question—in some considerable
number of years?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I know that for a fact because I used to go to the west coast and
see Frank every 5 years—5 or 7 years and we talked about him and I don’t remember
Jack or him ever saying they talked or wrote and Frank, I don’t think,
could write.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But as far as you know, he had no connection with him; is that
right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; but I do know he is a gambler and it is very well emphasized
in San Francisco that he is a gambler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about Benny Barrish?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Benny—I heard he is a liquor salesman. I knew him when we
were on the west coast. He’s a Chicagoan. He came out there in 1935 and as
far as I know he’s a liquor salesman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was the last connection you had with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I saw him about 8 or 9 or 10 years ago when I went to San
Francisco.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You haven’t seen him or corresponded with him in any way by
telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know if Jack ever knew him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, sure. We knew him from Chicago as kids, but I’m sure Jack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
hasn’t—now, I won’t say positive I know Jack hasn’t for any reason, unless
during this month—this particular month where he was having trouble early
in the fall of 1963 with regard to amateur auditions at his club. He had contacted
people all over the country trying to find out who knew the bigwigs in
the union where the AGVA, you know, the big shots—who they were that run
the union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would Benny Barrish be the sort of person who might know
something or be able to do something about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, he gets around—he knew and knows people in the liquor
business that have entertainments in San Francisco—it might be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As far as you know, Jack has made no connections out there
in anyway for some time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. In over 12 years—I would swear to this that he has had no
connection out there since before the war and he has never been west of 100
miles of this area in that time. I have many, many times heard where people
said he went to Las Vegas. He hasn’t been there only once with me and I think
that was when we went to—from Los Angeles back and, of course, that must
have been in 1937 or 1938, and he has not been back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see Jack Ruby, your brother, or communicate with him
every day, would you say, for a period of 60 to 90 days prior to November 24?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Every day? I don’t say I saw him every day, but I would say I
heard him on the phone three to five times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you be willing to say then that to the best of your knowledge
he was not out of the city of Dallas during that period, that is to <span class="locked">say——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, wait a minute, didn’t he go to New York in August?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, I was going to except August at that point—that’s why I
put it at 90 days.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Didn’t he go to see a fellow, Joe Glazer, who was the head of a
certain union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. We have evidence that he did go to New York in August, but after
that trip—let’s put it this way, from September 25 until November 25 just a
period of 2 months, can you state to us now that to the best of your knowledge,
Jack was not out of the Dallas area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I don’t remember him going out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Specifically, do you have any indication whatsoever of any kind
that he might have gone to Las Vegas during this period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That—I swear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you certainly would have known it if he had been gone,
say 3 or 4 days, wouldn’t you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, for one more reason, he would advise me to keep it quiet
and to collect the money to see that Andy does this or that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And there is nothing to indicate to you whatsoever that he was in
Las Vegas during September or October or November of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. But I know he has made many calls to the same fellow, McWillie.
I would say he made at least 10 calls in those 3 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what would be the reason for those calls?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. The same thing—Willie might know somebody in Las Vegas,
since there is that type of entertainment, with these amateurs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack tell you he was calling these various people because of
this trouble with the union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It seemed to me—well, he was so bitter against Barney—I
shouldn’t say this because—it’s just sickening—because they didn’t mean to hurt
him—Barney and Abe Weinstein and he felt—the union sent him a telegram to
quit these amateur auditions and they sent it to Abe and Barney, but they
wouldn’t quit, but Jack figured they had an “in” with the big guys, you know,
and Jack couldn’t get to this fellow, and he told me that he called McWillie. In
fact, he may have called him even 3 days before that—he was just sick about
this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, was McWillie, and I think you mentioned another person
earlier, Lenny Patrick he called?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, Lenny Patrick he called in Chicago—one time, and he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
not there, and until he got his number—he called 15 different people from what I
understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I was getting at is this—your explanation that if he called
Goldstein and Barrish and McWillie and so forth, your explanation that those
calls were made in connection with this difficulty about the amateur night
thing—was that information obtained by you from Ruby, or are you just giving us
your opinion of what those calls were about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, he has discussed this with me many times and I didn’t go
to the downtown club too often, but when I did go there, it so happened either
September or October on a particular Sunday night, whichever Sunday night it
was—there are five Sundays and whichever Sunday it would be, and the Vegas
Club would be closed on Sunday, he told me he had just gotten through talking
to somebody and I’ll be honest about it, it just went in one ear and out the other,
because I figured <span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you see what I am trying to get at and that is whether
or not your statements that those calls were made in connection with this
AGVA business derives from him directly or whether it is merely your opinion
that those calls were about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It is not only my opinion, we talked about it. We had discussed
it and he had told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that that does come—that information, then does come directly
from Jack?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, and one other thing, when I called home, I spoke to my
older brother and he knows Jack Yanover. My brother Jack did not know
Jack Yanover like my older brother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s who?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Hyman; he’s a friend of his and my older brother in this conversation
said to me, “I told him to call Jack Yanover. Maybe he knows somebody
because Yanover has some kind of saloon in Chicago,” that’s in my estimation
because of the way it looks, and this all went on and Jack used to rehash it
with me until it—well, I know that’s what that call was for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was all during the period then of September and October?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. In the summer—last summer and he also told me, you know,
he told me during one of those months he said, “I tried to call Lenny Patrick,”
and he said, “I got his number,” he got it from somebody and I don’t know
who, what and I didn’t give a darn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack tell you all of this prior to November 24?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, sure. To tell you the truth, the way I see Jack through
this little glass, he has very little to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know a man by the name of Robert McKeown [spelling]
M-c-K-e-o-w-n, or have you ever heard of him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Is it a Dallas man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I believe not.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Would it be my friend or Jack’s friend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, it would probably be Jack’s friend. Did Jack ever tell you
of contacting him by telephone and going to see him in the Galveston area concerning
the selling of jeeps to Castro?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Now, I know Jack was in Cuba 6 or 7 years ago or one of those
years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Oh, yes; you told us about that—that was when he went to join
McWillie for a little while?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; and I also know that I did hear the story about jeeps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you hear that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, let me say this—I don’t know whether I heard it last year
or the year before, but I do remember something in a conversation—some guy
told him he knew where there were 400 or 800 jeeps or 80 jeeps and whether
Jack went down—Jack went to Houston first of all—he did go to Houston last
year to see a man from a night club. They were going to exchange acts or work
in a deal, but I don’t remember who the man was, and this all came about, but
Jack, I’ll tell you, he isn’t that kind of a promoter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did Jack tell you about the jeeps?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. This was the deal with McWillie at the time and we were on
friendly terms, as much as I remember about it, and I think he shoved it off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it the jeep proposition that had something to do with Jack’s
visit to McWillie in Havana in 1959?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Jack was very depressed, he was having a lot of trouble, that
McWillie sent him as much as I know, a ticket to come to Havana to have a
week or 10 days vacation. That’s as much as I know of the whole darn thing
and deal outside of the talking about jeeps at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did that visit have anything to do with the jeeps in addition to
the rest and vacation that you know of? Now, don’t guess about it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; but I heard “Jeeps” but I didn’t pay too much attention to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, then, the real fact is you don’t know much about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I really don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You heard something about jeeps about that time, but you are
not in a position really to say that you know yea or nay—yes or no—whether
Jack’s visit to Havana with McWillie had to do with jeeps or not; isn’t that
right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Do you know that I didn’t know at the time he was in Havana.
I knew this a few years later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I mean is—the real fact is you don’t have any knowledge
of it—of the real facts?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I have no specific knowledge of it, but I do know that my sister
told me he was down in Havana. He called Chicago from there and he said
he’s in Havana and I think he spoke to Marion Carroll—that sister.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know a man by the name of Lawrence Meyers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I knew a Meyers but I can’t think of his first name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him or meet him during the first 3 weeks of November
1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Not that I know—I can’t think of it—no; this fellow I knew years
ago, but I can’t think of his first name—gee, that isn’t his first name. He used
to live here in town on Lemmon Avenue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know a man by the name of Alex Gruber?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. You mean Al Gruber on the West Coast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you known him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I heard his name around the house 30 years—Jack knew him
when they were young.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know that Jack had called him on the night of the
President’s death?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us how you knew it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Either late that evening or the next day he talked to Al and there
was something in the conversation—Al was here early in the fall and in fact
coming through—I was in the hospital and he promised Al a dog and it seems
to me I called him—I must have called him later on; anyway, when I did call
him a week or so later or whenever I did, I don’t know, but it was after this
incident, Al said, “You know, Jack was crying when he called me on the day
of the assassination?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack himself tell you he had called?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; Al told me. I had called Al myself. I had called Al within
10 days of the President’s assassination, something regarding to the dog.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, ma’am; I understand that—you mean before the President’s
assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. But Jack has talked to him before too—some weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But did Jack tell you that or did Gruber tell you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; Al told me this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not know that Jack had called Gruber on the night of the
President’s assassination until Gruber himself told you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; it seems to me that Jack even may have mentioned it, but still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
I made a call myself to Al in regards to the dog. Jack said he promised him a
certain dog.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you say Gruber had been through Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. While I was in the hospital in November—in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you see him then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; I did. He visited me at the Gaston Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You were hospitalized for how long?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. For about a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the nature of your illness; do you recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Tumor and hysterectomy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you were in there about a week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your relationship with Jack from the standpoint of,
say, personal relationship as brother and sister and, of course, as comanager—were
you on a friendly basis?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Most of the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Any difficulties between you sometimes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; lots of times. We got along a lot of times like a disagreeable
man and wife. If my band leader complained it was no good. If I complained
it was no good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was Jack’s attitude generally toward politics; do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He didn’t have any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. To your knowledge did he belong to any kind of organizations
whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Not one that I could put my—outside of the YW—YMCA or
something to that effect or the union connected with the musicians’ union or
AGVA, and maybe three or four private clubs around—entertainment clubs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he have any sort of attitudes toward conservatism or liberalism
or any kind of “ism”?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. All I know—he’s a good American and he is far better than a
lot of people are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, did you ever notice any interest that he had in pro-Cuban
affairs or anti-Cuban affairs or pro-Castro or anti-Castro or anything of that sort?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. This is the exact words when they spit on Stevenson last fall—Jack
and I were going to dinner or coming to dinner and someway or somehow
we were sitting in the car—his car—and he looked at me and he says,
“Isn’t that awful?” He says, “They ought to knock their heads together.”
Now, we were told two young fellows out of college or in college did that and
he says, “To think—a man devotes his time” and he went on for a couple of
minutes, and that was it, and I remember the incident of—I’ll tell you—he
respects high people and he admires highly educated, cultured people—good family
men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well the answer to my question, I gather, from what you have
said, then, is that Jack did not have any ideas that were pro-Cuba or anti-Cuba
or pro-Castro or anti-Castro?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He was against communism from the beginning of when it even
entered his mind. I don’t know what year—maybe 35 years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did he express himself on that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He didn’t have to—from the things he done—was too American—too
much American.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But my point is—I gather from that that he never discussed
with you his feelings about communism or anything—it’s just that you observed
that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, I’m not an intellectual on those subjects, to be honest
about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was he the type of man that would be interested in these subjects
himself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; not to express it openly or fight with it—in this manner, if
you said anything against anybody or anything big of our country that is
Americanism—you might as well—he would knock the hell out of you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, what you are saying to me is that if he has any
kind of “ism” at all, it would be Americanism?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right—he has that—he does have that—that’s his greatest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Jack never married, did he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; he was engaged to a young lady here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What generally was his attitude toward women; do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, in his late life I think he was sort of a playboy myself,
but in his early life he wanted to get married. There were several individuals
he had a great love for and the trouble is, he picked on women who were of
means and he couldn’t give them what they wanted. He could tell from the
way they were reared or their attitude, and how they expressed themselves when
they get married—what they wanted, and I think it sort of cooled him toward
making it. He liked women. He was a real man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understood he took good care of himself physically?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In the sense that he took physical exercise regularly?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. And the truth is, he has a great sympathy for women who are
left with hardships and maybe it started with me or my mother—if they have
to work and do a lot of things—it was in the back of his mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Jack didn’t drink very much, did he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He didn’t drink a fifth of liquor a year. When we went out,
we ordered two drinks, I would drink mine and have to drink two-thirds of
his. Then, we were ashamed to sit there and he would order it again—not
that I’m such a big drinker, but that’s what he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about smoking—he didn’t smoke either, did he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I don’t remember but once he had a cigar in his mouth, a couple
of years ago at a party and maybe he had three or four cigarettes in his life,
that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you and he have any difficulties about the girl that he was
going out with one time and I think Rabbi Silverman had to kind of intervene?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That he was going with? That wasn’t it—it wasn’t about a
girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you did have a disagreement?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. A very big disagreement—early this summer of 1963—it was in
the early part of the summer. It was over money. He had $800 or $900 and
he wanted to pay bills and somebody encountered him who needed their car
fixed or something and I think he paid for the car and he didn’t pay the electric
bills, and when he went to jail in November—3 months of the Carousel’s bill
on the electric company wasn’t paid and it ran almost $800 or $900 for 3 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the particular argument about then—that he had
loaned some money to someone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; it was not the first occasion only—this one—that’s the time
that I blew my top and I had been sick—I have been in very bad physical
condition and he wanted me to get out of the club, and Leo Torti who worked
for us on weekends told him that I was having a difficult time and I should be
in the hospital and he said, “I gave you money to go to the hospital,” and he
gave me a push and I had just got some new high heeled shoes and I went back
about 8 feet and I hurt my arm and my shoulder and he wanted me out of the
Vegas Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whose car did he have repaired with the money you thought he
should have used for the lights?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Some family man—he does that—I haven’t the least idea and
I don’t think he did either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you find out it was used to repair someone’s car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Some man come in my club weeks later and says, “Your brother
was in,” and I didn’t even know this man’s business, and he said he works
there as a car mechanic and he says, “He got someone’s car out of hock,” so I
figured maybe it was his car—I didn’t think of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was that man, do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Some customer at the Vegas Club—if I saw him, I would know
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t remember his name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; but I knew his appearances. He was one like the regulars
who come about every month one time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know what kind of car he drove?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; I was in the club—I wouldn’t know what the patrons were
driving, but he did repair someone’s car and it was a family man that was
supposed to go on the road or some darn thing and if I’m not mistaken, as far
as I know, my brother never got the money back. It wasn’t $800 worth of repairs,
but these are the things that he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the twistboard deal, can you tell us about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; he met a man—I think this man lives in Fort Worth and
I think his name is out there somewhere and it says a plastic company on that
thing—I’m almost sure it is the same man, and this man was manufacturing
them and Jack had a deal with him to cover Texas, and if it went good, Jack
would get the whole United States. In fact, I think somewhere in my apartment
there might be a twistboard. I don’t know if I ever saw the man or not, but
I believe he is in either Arlington or Fort Worth, lived there, and there is a
twistboard that Jack—he sold quite a number—he sent some out to different
people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was Earl interested in that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I don’t know. Earl’s partner, I think, is a friend that he knows—we
call him George—in a laundry in Detroit. Whether he was or has been—I
don’t think Earl wanted—in Earl’s business with this man, I think the contract
reads he cannot go into another business. I may be wrong, but I’m almost
sure that’s what I remember Earl saying at one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whether Earl had any interest in the twistboard
operations at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I doubt it, unless he advanced Jack some money, but I don’t think
there was that much money put into it. The man let Jack have, say, a hundred
twistboards and he paid for them and I don’t know too much about it, but I did
have them in the club and we gave them away as prizes and I know Jack
contacted weight salons where women go to reduce about them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember having any contact whatsoever with Ralph
Paul?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. During the period from November 22 through November 24, up
until the time Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I don’t think I even talked to him during those days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s what I mean.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. You know, I assume him and Jack were very good friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I’m not suggesting to the contrary.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He never did call me and I never called him—I don’t remember
calling him. I have called him many times since then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; I know, but I’m talking about during this particular period
of 3 days.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I don’t think he has ever called me—I have called him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I mean—let’s restrict ourselves for the moment to the three
days of November 22, 23, and 24.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He may have called me on the 24th of November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, there was at least 20 calls when I did not pick up the
phone—people in my home did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No, ma’am; that’s not what I’m talking about but let me get
at it this way—was there any contact between you and Ralph Paul from the
time the President was shot until the time Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; definitely not. Can I go back with something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes, ma’am.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Let me explain about this Raymond Jones. He worked for 19
years at the Dallas Athletic Club and when Jack got in trouble, the very next
week he had made a remark to his boss, whoever he is, “I’m going to see my
friend,” they said, “Where are you going?” And he said, “I’m going to see my
friend,” and they said, “Who is your friend?” And he said, “Jack Ruby.”
They told him that if he went to see Jack that he didn’t have a job. He says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>
“Well,”—he came back and he went to see Jack and he couldn’t get in and
he came to see me at the Club and he says he just quit. I said, “After 19
years?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The Vegas was closed too, was it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It was closed on and off a few times after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I mean, the Vegas was closed on November 22, November 23,
and November 24?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, 2 days after that—it was closed for 5 days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then ultimately it was sold?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Then, I opened it again and I closed it and I opened it for New
Year’s and I closed it permanently January 4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Until when?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Until someone else bought it—it wasn’t in operation until this
woman got her license, which was about the 1st of March.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And of course the Carousel closed too because of the license lapsing—the
liquor license?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; they closed February the 12th, from what I understand— their
liquor license was revoked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, let’s take a break for a few minutes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. You mentioned a man’s name McKeown or something like that;
may I ask you what he does?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Let’s take a break now, Eva.</p>

<p>(The deposition proceedings were recessed as heretofore stated and continued
as hereinafter shown.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let the record show that the deposition is continuing after the
recess at 9:10 p.m. and that Mr. Burleson will ask some questions with respect
to the block of questions and the areas covered by those questions before I go on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Mrs. Grant, you were saying out at the Vegas Club that the
employees were paid in cash, and you mentioned something about giving them
some type of check with their name on it. Would the transaction be such that
you would give them a check and then cash the check for them in effect?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s exactly it, but the check never went through the bank
procedure. It was like a voucher that they had received that money on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Was it on a regular bank draft that it was made out on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Most of the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And the net effect would be that you would give them a check
and then cash it for them and take the check back and give them cash?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, I put the check in an envelope and I would have—like your
salary is $65, withholding and social security, and write on the back of the envelope
that, and a lot of them kept their envelopes and a lot of them threw it out
and they had signed the check and returned it and the balance of what money
they should receive was in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, you were in the hospital the first part of November 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I was sick for a solid week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, you had been having some trouble for quite some time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And as a matter of fact, Jack had been trying to get you to go
into the hospital because the doctors had advised him and you that you needed
this operation immediately? And you had been prepared on at least one,
or maybe more than one occasion, to go to the hospital and everything had been
arranged for the operation and you backed out at the last moment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And Jack knew that you were having this trouble and knew
that the doctors recommended that, and you talked with your doctors about
this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. All through the whole week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And finally he was able to get you in the hospital there the
first part of November 1963; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And you then had what—a partial or complete hysterectomy, or
do you know?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I know they took out a tremendous tumor and a lot of things—I
didn’t ask because I don’t know what parts it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Who was the doctor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Bill Aranov.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Then you got out of the hospital 7 days after the 6th, which
would have been about the 13th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And that was in the middle of a week—about a Wednesday,
wasn’t it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; Wednesday—that’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, were you given some medication after you left the hospital?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, not for a few days, I would say, but about the third or
fourth day I got pretty bad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. You started what—hurting and being in pain?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Tremendous pain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And did this doctor that had operated on you prescribe some
pills?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. His coworker or assistant—I think his name is Dr. Bookatz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. But, at any rate, a doctor did prescribe some pills. What
type of pills were they, do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I believe that they have codeine in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. What would be the effect on you that these pills would have?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, they put me into a trance and made my body stiff and I
didn’t have any more pain but I wasn’t as alert as I usually was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did it affect your thinking?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did Jack visit you in the hospital?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes; two or three times a day—mostly two times anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And called on the phone sometimes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes; and sent me three bouquets of flowers and everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And how long did you take this medicine after you started
taking it—2 or 3 days after you got out of the hospital?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, I really didn’t start to take it until the weekend after I
was home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. That would have been the weekend about the 16th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And how long did you take it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, there was 1 or 2 days I cut down and then I—about the
21st, which was a Thursday, I had an unusual severe pain and I started all over
again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Taking heavy doses of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, they are tablets and I called his nurse and she suggested
to take them but not as often as I did when I complained it threw me into a
trance but it still did, because I am not a pill taker and I guess pills work a little
better on me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Were you taking pills on the day of the 22d of November?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I already had two pills by the time the President was assassinated—these
pills are prescribed one every 4 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Do you subscribe to the Dallas Morning News or did you back
on November 22?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No, no; but my manager was very sympathetic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Your manager?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. My manager brought it up every day she came to the apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. That’s your manager at the apartment house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And she brought it up—the paper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. About what time of the morning on November 22 did she
bring it up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It may have been around 11 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Had you heard from Jack before that concerning the ad?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; shortly—it seemed within the next 20 minutes I would think
that he may have called.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Had you seen the ads by Bernard Weissman by the time
Jack called?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, I had seen it, but I’ll be honest—I <span class="locked">didn’t——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did you see it after you got the paper on the morning of the
22d before Jack called on the 22d?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And Jack was talking about it at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And would you relate at this time some of the things you
recall he said at that time about the Bernard Weissman ad.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, the first thing he asked was if Pauline is going to take
over—she was the manager, and do this and do that and get the napkins and
all of this stuff connected with the club and then he said, “Did you see the ad?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. This was before the President was shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes. It so happened that that whole page was like on the back
of a section—it seemed to me anyway that it was that way and it was open
right on my bed—that section, anyway, was opened at that time for some reason
or other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. What did Jack say when he called you about the ad?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. At that time he said, “Did you see the ad?” And I said, “What
ad?” He said, “About the President?” And I said, “Yes.” It said, “Welcome,
Mr. Kennedy,” and he didn’t say too much then. He said some words in regard—like
what do you think of it, so I said, “Oh”——He said, “Did you read
it?” And I says, “Yes, yes.” You know, I wanted to get away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Had you really read it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Even if I did, I’ll be honest about it, it didn’t appear to me to
be bad or good because I didn’t read all the way down and think about it and I
didn’t study it like maybe I did later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Anyway, go back to what he said then.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, he said, “Read it.” He says, “I’ll call you later.” And he
was in the Dallas Morning News, I think, at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. He said something to lead you to believe that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; well, he said—it seems to me, “I’m in the News, and I’m
going to Toni Zoppi’s office,” which was somewhere in the building, and “I’ve
got to pick up a pamphlet.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Toni Zoppi being the entertainment editor or amusement
editor of the Dallas Morning News?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right; and Jack had given him an ad a week before on
a certain entertainer and that’s the fellow that made the remark, but that was
Del Mar—Bill DelMar or DeMar or something like that, and Jack wanted it
because, I guess, the entertainer wanted all this stuff back—that’s what we call
writeups.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. When was the next time, then, that you heard from Jack;
was that after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And at that time what was Jack’s state as you recall it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, I was hysterical myself. He must have been crying, from
his voice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. At the time that he called, did you know that President Kennedy
had been assassinated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes; because Pauline had called me and on my clock it was
about 25 to 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. What was Jack doing—saying—or was he crying?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, when Jack called it was after 1 again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. How was he—was he upset or normal?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, he was upset.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He says, “I’m in the Dallas Morning News,” and I could hear—it
wasn’t distinct, but he says, “The people are all around here, the phones are
ringing like hell and everyone is canceling their subscriptions and their ads—big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
ads from all over the State,” and he said, “Did you read it?” And so I read
it again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. While he was waiting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; but I mean since then—I looked at it—I’ll be honest about
it, I didn’t comprehend it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. You see, I didn’t comprehend it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Tell us what else he said.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, Jack said something about John Newman, the fellow that
takes the ads there and he says, “You know, Jack, I have to take orders from my
superiors,” and Jack, whether he told me that night or later on in the afternoon— he
said, “What are you—so money hungry? That you have to take $1,500 for
an ad?” Jack knew a full page cost approximately that—I mean, he is well
aware of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Let me bring you forward a little bit on these occasions that
you told the FBI about in these statements where Jack spent this time with you
at your house—would you watch television during this period of time or some of
the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, he didn’t. I had watched it a great deal that afternoon on a
Friday, and he came over—it seems to me when he left the News he came over
and came back later on with a lot of groceries and by that time either I saw
Curry or somebody else on the television and he was saying, “We got the right
man.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did Jack see that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I don’t know—I really don’t know. I tell you—usually under
those pills, I thought I heard it plenty that day, and we got sick when we were
talking about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did you and Jack talk about Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He had made very few remarks— he says, “He’s a creep.” You
see, “a creep” is a real low life to Jack and “what a creep he is,” he says, and he
was sick—he went in the bathroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did he actually vomit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He did not—he was sick to his stomach and he cried, he looked
terrible—he just wasn’t himself, and truthfully, so help me, I remember even my
mother’s funeral—it just killed him. He said this, “Someone tore my heart out,”
and he says, “I didn’t even feel so bad when pops died because pappa was an
old man. He was close to 90.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. What did Jack have to say about President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, all I know is that it just killed him. I’ll tell you the truth—he
sat there like it wasn’t worth life—like he thought they were out to get the
world, the whole world, and this was part of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right. He was very respectful of President Kennedy as a
man and as a President?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, he admired him—he thought this man was a great man of
courage. If I said anything like I said there—something about his brother and
integration, he said, “This man is greater, than Lincoln”—the same night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did Jack ever have an occasion to say anything to you about
a letter that was in the newspaper that was written by some man, purportedly
to President Kennedy’s daughter, Caroline?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I don’t know about that, but the week—the same week of the
assassination—I think it was Monday or Tuesday—it was that week, there was
a picture of the President sitting behind the desk just like you are and John-John
was sitting at the front and you could see him playing around, I think it
was his father’s feet, and he called it his house—I think, let me put it this way:
My brother says, “This kid don’t know his father is the President and the father
don’t act like a President.” He meant that he was just like a good guy—like
acting ordinarily, like he wasn’t of wealth or power—he was just like the average
young man and Jack looked at him as even being much younger than he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. But you don’t know anything about such a letter being in the
paper that Jack saw?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I don’t know—if he did, I don’t know it. I’ll tell you, I don’t
know about that picture—it was the first week that I was home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. On Saturday, the times that Jack was in your house, do you
recall if he watched any television?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No—very little. Saturday he came in with three pictures, and at
the left hand corner, they were postal card pictures and he told me what he did.
He went home and he couldn’t sleep—he got Larry out of bed and George
Senator, and I thought he was nuts, I’ll be honest with you about it, so help me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I thought my brother Jack was plain nuts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Is that when he went out in the middle of the morning and took
the pictures?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right; and he didn’t know exactly where he saw it—that
was the worst part of it and Larry told me that later on when they found him,
he came back to it and they drove around and waited for daylight and he showed
Larry how to take the pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. You are talking about the “Impeach Earl Warren” sign?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right—all of this got in Jack’s mind that some Communist—no,
no—he didn’t use the word “Communist”. I think he said “Some outfit
or some lousy guy,” or something was putting up signs like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did Jack tell you what he was going to do with this picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. First, he showed it to me—three little pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. You actually saw the pictures?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes—I saw them—they are postal cards—laying out on my white
table. They were this big (indicating).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. These are pictures of “Impeach Earl Warren” signs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; and they looked like the American flag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And it was on this Polaroid film?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. The camera is still at my house, so that’s the same camera,
I’m sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It was like a postal card picture. It seems to me in the left
hand corner was that, and at the bottom it said, “Belmont—Impeach Earl Warren,”
and a box number and it said, “Belmont, Massachusetts.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. What did Jack tell you as he showed you those pictures?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He called Stanley because he had a lot of faith in him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Stanley who?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Stanley Kaufman; an attorney. This is another wonderful
American, and he said, “Stanley,” and he told him about the pictures and then
he talked to me, he says, “You know what, I went down to the post office and
the newspaper box—the post office box——”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. The newspaper box of Bernard Weissman’s ad?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes—“It’s so stuffed with mail,” he said to the clerk, and you
can find out now which clerk this is, and on the 23d he was there at 6 or 7
o’clock in the morning and Larry and Senator should know the time—I really
don’t know that—but it seems to me that’s what he said.</p>

<p>First of all, he figured that a gentile is using that name to blame all this on
a Jew—about that ad, and then he analyzed the ad on Saturday and he saw
the black border.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Will you tell me what Jack said he was going to do with these
pictures?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He talked to Stanley and he was going to take them to the
FBI—Monday, the first thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Was he also going to take them to Mr. Gordon McLendon
who was the operator of KLIF?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; he said he was going up there that night. Whether he did
or was there or not, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did he mention at that time—did he mention Mr. McLendon’s
name, that Mr. McLendon does these editorials on radio station KLIF?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes—he was very close to Gordon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. In fact, I think he called Gordon from my house. He was there—and
on Saturday he spent a long time with me and he called many people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And he was quite upset over these pictures and signs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, let’s come forward to where we were talking about this
Al Gruber.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes—Al.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Or it’s possibly Alex Gruber.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; it’s Al Gruber—his nickname is Musty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And there was something about a dog?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, is this the dog that Jack was having someone build a
crate for?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right; or buy a crate or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And that he could ship this dog to Al Gruber in a crate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It seems to me when Al was here when I was in the hospital,
Jack had promised him a certain dog, I don’t know which one it is, and not a
dog, but a certain dog, because Jack had a lot of dogs. His dogs just had
puppies, I think, in the last month and Al had talked to—Jack had talked to
Andy Armstrong—Andrew—and said something about getting a crate and Al
wanted this dog.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now bringing you forward a little bit to this episode that you
and Jack had the trouble over that ended up in going to Rabbi Silverman and
that you touched upon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, he went to Rabbi Silverman because we weren’t talking for
about 2 weeks. This was previous to the operation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right; and did Rabbi Silverman talk to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Had Jack complained to him that he couldn’t get along with
you or something?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well. I don’t know exactly what Jack said—the rabbi, you see,
didn’t tell me, but I told the rabbi about this money deal. Of course, I didn’t
tell him that I didn’t go to the hospital on all these times that I had made arrangements
with the doctors and backed out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, you were asked some questions concerning Jack’s political
beliefs or political leanings or political philosophies or political—anything that
had to do with politics, did you ever hear Jack saying anything about being a
Democrat or a Republican or being a right wing or left wing—he didn’t get
involved in politics?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Now, this is it—my older brother knew a lot of Democrats and it
seemed that we followed in their footsteps, because this is what I heard as a
child—that the Democrats are for the poor people, so we as poor people went
along with them, but we were never the kind that I was to go out and get votes
or boast about a fellow—me and Jack—never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. You don’t know if Jack worked in any type of political movement?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Not to my knowledge. My older brother did—he was a Democrat
and he worked for Governor Horner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is the older brother?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Hyman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, I think you also told me that Earl Ruby’s wife had a great
admiration for President Kennedy also?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Truthfully, Earl couldn’t get out of her sight unless she OK’d
it, but she was such a great admirer, and you know how much time he spent
down here and money and Earl said she never said a word—she just loved him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. You mean loved the President?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. The President—the late President. They’ve got pictures—little
pictures before the assassination—they had all of those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. That’s enough on that. Now, one last <span class="locked">area—</span></p>

<p>Since, and limit this to strictly since the conviction, you have visited Jack
nearly daily in the jail?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, I would say at least six times out of the week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. What is, in your opinion, Jack’s present condition?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I believe he is mentally deranged, inasmuch as I’m not a doctor,
but from what he says to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. You have now, as of this moment, been informed by a newspaper
and also by me about what Jack attempted to do today?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And you were informed and knew of what Jack had attempted
to do about a month ago when he rammed his head up against the wall, were you
not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. What has Jack told you as to what you should do with and to
yourself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He wants me to do away with myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Does he give you a reason why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He thinks they are going to kill out all the Jews and he has
made remarks that 25 million Jews have been slaughtered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Already?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. On the floor below.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And they are being slaughtered where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. In the jail and sometimes it’s planes going over and they are
dropping bombs on the Jews.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Has he told you about hearing or seeing Jews boiled in oil?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And has he told you about seeing or hearing his brother, Earl,
being dismembered?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; and his children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And Earl’s children, and by dismembered, he has seen them
cut off?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Arms and legs—they are cut off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Does he, nearly every time you talk to him, ask you to check
on them, when is the last time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I have to sort of tell real lies, that I just got through talking
with Sam and Earl and with Eileen and with Sam and everything is OK.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Because he says that they have been doing this to them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He says many times he has seen Sam on the second floor and
the rabbi was going—yesterday, they took the rabbi, sometimes they take
Stanley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. That’s Stanley Kaufman you are talking about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Stanley Kaufman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. In other words. Jack just doesn’t make sense when you talk
to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, no; then sometimes he will say one thing that will be all
right and then he goes off into this stuff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Has Jack told you that he was actually tried for the killing of
President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; but he thinks that they think that he killed the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did he tell you that what he went through with was not really
a trial, but a farce?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And part of a play?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. In fact; his verdict is on the 14th and the next day he says to me
in front of Eileen, “When will the trial be?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did he say it wasn’t really Judge Brown that was up there
but somebody else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s exactly what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did he tell you anything about their introducing evidence in
his absence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And that evidence that they were supposed to have introduced
is the fact that he killed President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, he just thinks they are blaming him for it and they think
he did it and they are going to take it out on all the Jews.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Does he tell you many times that you will never see him again
because he will be killed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Every time he kisses me goodby that day, he says, “You will
never see me again. Do away with yourself.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. To save yourself this punishment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. What is your opinion as to his present condition mentally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I have seen him just 24 hours ago and he was in a very bad state
of mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. He was in a very bad state of mind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. How about physically?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He has lost between 35 and 40 pounds to my knowledge. He
looks like he has been in a concentration camp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. What is his greatest desire as you know it right now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He wants to tell the Warren Commission the truth—he wants
truth serum and a lie detector test.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. The truth being not going into the psychomotor variant
epilepsy.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He don’t know much about that—he doesn’t even know what they
are talking about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. He just wants to tell how he felt and how these things affected
him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. I believe that’s all on those.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When he tells you these various things, do you try to straighten
him out and say to him that it is not so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. When it first started—I didn’t realize this—I hadn’t said things—I
said, “Don’t be crazy,” just words like that—“what are you talking crazy,”
and then when we got to—this Dr. Beavers into the case and I talked to him and
he read something of his report and, of course, my sister was here at that time.
Every day he would say to her, “You’ll never see me again. Kiss me goodby
through the glass.” You know, if it wasn’t so serious it would be funny in a
way, because it don’t seem like him. It seems that if I agree with him it’s no
good and I have tried—I realize Dr. Beavers said if you’d try agreeing with
him then he says, “You don’t believe me, do you?” He says, “They are playing
a game with you, don’t believe Phil, don’t believe him.” And I said, “What
about the rabbi?” And he says, “The rabbi don’t listen to me.” And truthfully,
every time the rabbi went up there he came down sick and disgusted with himself—he’s
trying to knock some sense into Jack and it don’t work—it doesn’t register
with the rabbi, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I wanted to get at—you all are trying to discourage him
from having these views?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, after talking to the psychiatrist, I said I don’t know what
to do. If I tell you, you will agree with him it is no good, and if I don’t—I stay
there and listen through this glass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. I might be able to help with that—help clarify that—when he
says that they have just killed Earl or Sam or their children, you say, “No,
that’s not true because I just talked to them?”</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I say, “I just talked to them,” and then we’ll get onto something
and I will try to talk about a friend who wrote a letter or someone came to see
him and he goes right back, he says, “There’s no more Earl. They have dismantled
him.” That’s the words he uses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And do you come back and say, “Well, it’s not true because
I just talked to him 30 minutes ago or 2 hours ago?”</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Or, he makes me promise, “Will you call them tonight to be sure
it’s not so—to be sure it wasn’t him,” and I’ll be sure that it is somebody else
on the phone. They can check with the calls last Saturday—he made seven calls
to Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who did?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Jack; he don’t know that he made them, he don’t know that he
made that many. I got the letter that he made them from Eileen at home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He is allowed to make phone calls though?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, sometimes—I think he annoys them a little bit—those who
sympathize with him and they figure he’s pretty screwy, you know he is really
gone—he makes these collect calls to Chicago and they let him and there are
one or two guards that aren’t as nice—I think they are not as tolerant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Let’s go off the record just a second, so that I can give Mr.
Hubert some information.</p>

<p>(Discussion between counsel and the witness off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. They have a pay phone out there in the jail, do they not?</p>

<p>Let’s go off the record just a second to give Mr. Hubert some information.</p>

<p>(Discussion between counsel off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I have to explain what went on while we were off the record.</p>

<p>Let the record show that while we were off the record Mr. Burleson was
explaining to me the circumstances used in the jail for allowing prisoners,
especially those who are under a death sentence to use the pay phone in the jail,
and that was the substance of the conversation off the record.</p>

<p>Now, do you have any more questions, Mr. Burleson? Are you through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I wanted to get into the matter of the financing of the defense
of your brother, Jack—I suppose we should start with the selection of the
attorneys originally in this case. Now, we know that Mr. Tom Howard apparently
took the first affirmative action on behalf of Jack Ruby in the afternoon
of November 24.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. On the 24th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I want to ask you if you know by whose authority he took
this action?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Ralph Paul, who knows nothing about lawyers—only knew
Howard and they called them thinking they could get back on bond. Now, I
didn’t know Oswald died until later in the afternoon. I was hysterical over
this shooting and being sick and the President’s assassination—in fact, my
television was on but it was turned down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, it was Ralph Paul that called Mr. Howard for
the initial step?</p>

<p>When it came to the charge of the matter which ultimately followed, did you
have anything to do with the selection of the attorneys who would defend your
brother Jack?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Let me put it this way—there was Daugherty and Sullivan and
Jim Martin, and one guy was threatened and one fellow’s wife didn’t want
him in. Tom Howard pushed Jim Martin out of the case. I was panicky here.
I had asked Tom to call Fred Brunner, Charles Tessmer—what is the name of
this Erisman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Fred Erisman.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Erisman or something like that and also Percy Foreman to get
another lawyer—you know, a super lawyer that I felt—I didn’t know too much
about Tom, but talking to Chicago and people telling me here and everything,
anyway, Tom remained in the case and I understand he didn’t contact these
people as quickly as he should and Earl was panicky up in Detroit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Didn’t Earl come down here as a result of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Not that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Not that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I don’t know how many days later he did come, but we were
on the phone constantly. He went to the west coast and he went to see one of
the names there, Mike Shore who knows Frank Sinatra there and we figured
that they would know somebody and that’s how Belli came into the picture.
Now, that is that part of the picture. Now, we didn’t have any money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about Tonahill, how did he get in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh: he was a friend of Belli’s—Belli invited him in—as much
as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, Tonahill came in after Belli did; is that correct?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Or maybe together—they were together I think on insurance
cases previously—I assume this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, Belli chose a local lawyer, as it were, to go along with him;
is that the idea?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, Tom was still in the case. Tom called him right away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Called who?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. You know more about that—Tom got us an investigator, Bob
Dennison.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. You made the statement that Tom called you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Tom called you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean Phil Burleson?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Phil Burleson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And ultimately, in any case, Mr. Belli was retained to handle
the defense?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was a fee arrangement made with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Let me explain that part—this is what I know. I was not in
San Francisco or Los Angeles. Earl told me this—he says, “You’re looking at
Belli—$75,000,” and Earl thought you might as well have said $75 million, but
he says, “I will want about $25,000 to pay my expenses and I think I could
write a book and make $50,000.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Earl was telling you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Earl told me words <span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That Belli had told him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; and this is what took place in their conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you were quoting some sentences there a moment ago,
I understood you to mean, and see if I am correct, that Earl was telling you
what Belli had told him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes, and I don’t know if there was a contract—I assumed it was
agreeable with Earl. Earl already had talked to a fellow by the name of Billy
Woodfield, the writer. Billy Woodfield, and don’t ask me how they got connected—I
know little about these things—he’s going to write a short story for
Europe, and he probably could help us raise this initial $25,000 cash. Well, no;
he didn’t say that—that was for his expenses—he didn’t get any money down
that day as far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, the fee was $75,000, of which he <span class="locked">thought——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He could write a book and retain $50,000 out of the book, but
he would like $25,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As soon as possible?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That I don’t know—he says for expenses on the case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much was actually paid to him; do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Let me tell you this—the short stories were sold in Europe and
some in America through newspapers. Each paper paid separately—$400, $300,
$600, and the story said, “My story—Jack Ruby.” I gave most of the story, Jack
gave some of it, but I knew this story—what would you call it—little incidents
that happened in his life, some of it, and some part of the story was right on
Friday and Saturday the 22d. I gave the whole story, you know, I have newspaper
stories of it, and I gave it to Belli, and all these little stories, we were
supposed to get $50,000 from all the different agencies that bought this to put
it in their papers—that’s how it’s done, but we received, I would say to my
knowledge, $23,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How was it handled?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Earl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Earl controlled the funds at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. At that time, yes. It came to the writer and the agent, Larry
Schiller and Billy Woodfield. Larry sells the story, Billy wrote the story. You
know, you need a writer even though you write.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I’m talking about the money that came to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, they received some money on the west coast but they
deposited it in a bank with an escrow deal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In what bank and under what name was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Earl will tell you—Earl has papers from the bank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I know it’s in Hollywood and I know Earl says he received about
$23,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was not handled in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Not to my knowledge—1 cent of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you say that Earl is the one who is handling the money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. At that time, Earl had power of attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He had a power of attorney from Jack?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, this contract was made for the benefit of Jack,
as it were, and the money that came in was put into some escrow agreement
and then Earl was able to withdraw from that and sign checks against it by
virtue of the power of attorney; is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right, that’s right; these people received, I would say,
35 percent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that correct—the way I put it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; but we received ourselves, I think, $23,000—there may
have been $30,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened to the money you did receive?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Earl has checks that were made out directly to Belli, which I
think he himself cashed about $13,200.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who is “he”?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Mr. Melvin Belli. I do know that the doctors were paid and
that may have run to $3,500, and we do know that Bob Dennison received $4,000.
I cannot give you step by step because I do not have it, but Earl has an accounting
of all the money received through the efforts of that story; however, Earl
has spent—I don’t know how many thousands. In the first place, I think Earl
put in $7,000 right away for things, but he took it out later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know how much has been received all told—you say
about $23,000 as a result of the story?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s as much as I know. This is what I know. There may
have been some money—we were supposed to get money in later, but I don’t know
if we got it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were there any other people or organizations that contributed
any money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; <span class="locked">well——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or, do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; I know. But I’m trying to think how to tell it to you.
Recently we received $100 from Walter Winchell in the last 10 days. We received
$250 a month ago from friends back in Chicago. Then there is a lot of
5’s and 10’s—I guess I, myself, could not go into that account, by the way.
In the city of Dallas, I received $245 that I had given to Eileen to reimburse
Earl. We put that in a Jack’s defense fund. I received that amount, then that
was December and January—those months, and then in March or April, I
think I also took $110—let me tell you, the money comes into the county building,
you know, the checks, and when I say I received it, it doesn’t come directly to me.</p>

<p>I typed up all the money on a list and I sent it on to Eileen with a check
for deposit of $110. That’s the money that I know, but if we will stop for a
minute, I know the hundred, the 250, the 245 and the hundred—those were plus
that $23,000. Now, if there is any other money—did I tell you any other money?
I told you everything there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. There are no substantial amounts?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, no; listen, don’t listen to those reports.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Except from the result of the selling?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. The big fee was $250 and the story was sold, and we received—I
would say Larry Schiller and Billy Woodfield took 35 percent of the money—the
writer and the agent that sells it of the story. I know there was $23,000
came in and there may have been more since then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In any case, Earl would have more accurate figures?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As far as you know, in the handling of the money, it is less
than a thousand dollars that came through you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I think there is a thousand in all of this money and a few hopes.
The New York Times was very sympathetic and they put an ad in their paper.
Most papers will not take an ad for what you call “Jack Ruby’s Defense Fund.”
The ad cost $150—I think they took it less than the ad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You paid $150?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I didn’t—someone in Chicago or Earl must have paid it, but I do
know that, that ad went in. Now, if any other little moneys come in, I don’t have
any accounting of it. I know it came in here—this is the money that I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And to your knowledge, then, what has come through your hands
is less than a thousand dollars?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, let’s see—$245, $110, $250, and $100—I think that’s about
it, unless I have forgotten some, but that’s all I know myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All the rest has been handled by Earl?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That was for the sale of the short story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, at the present time who are the attorneys for Jack Ruby?
That he still has? Mr. Tonahill is apparently still in the case?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, we retained Mr. Tonahill and Burleson from the very first
minute and they are still in. Shall I tell him about Belli?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. The day of the verdict I got a telephone call that if Belli don’t
get out of town they are going to kill him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know who the phone call was from?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; but on the other hand, I <span class="locked">think——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you convey that information to Mr. Belli?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from him Saturday. He had
a heart attack while he was here, I think, during the trial—he was deathly sick.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Belli was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. There were a few days he went to get a cardiograph and all that.
One of the days, 1 of the 2 days—well, it wasn’t 1 day, it was 3 days, really,
but he went to court anyway, and I remember on the Saturday he went to some
clinic here and got all kinds of tests, but the day before he was almost a goner.</p>

<p>After I heard the news of the verdict and what came over radio or television,
I thought he would die. He couldn’t talk on the phone—he mumbled Saturday to
some member of my family who called him. I didn’t hear anything until later
on—late Sunday afternoon, and Monday I went to visit him at his suite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right; at the Statler-Hilton. He answered the phone and,
of course, I heard mumbling and there were newspapermen and Life magazine
men—I don’t remember everyone that was there, but there were 10 or 12, maybe
about 10 people, my sister and myself. His wife was leaving one direction and he
was leaving the other. She was white as a ghost and he was white as a ghost
and I just didn’t say anything because they were packed up to leave and I didn’t
want it to get out because he said he was going to San Antonio, but I don’t think
he went there at all. I think he went another direction because he just wanted
to sort of fool who was after him, but it was a very bad day for him and myself
and my sister. I didn’t even tell her that. You see, they were downtown and I
was home in my apartment the day of the verdict. I was glad when he left.
That, and adding up a few other things—people said, “You are lucky to get him
out because you didn’t know the things.” They said, “They were trying Melvin
Belli and they weren’t trying Jack Ruby.”</p>

<p>Of course, between that telephone call and <span class="locked">everything——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that a local call?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or, was it a long distance call?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; it was a local call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it a man or a woman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. A man, and another thing, I know my phone was tapped and
I know—it’s a terrible thing to say, but I have all reasons to believe that the
district attorney has been on it and is still on it. The only time they got off is
when I went to the FBI and complained about it; that I thought my brother
wasn’t protected in the city jail, and somebody knows every move I was making.
It seems my phone was clearer after that, and truthfully, if the district attorney<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
has any tapes on me, it should be in on the tape of the day of the verdict, and I
was so sick over the verdict and having this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You did not recognize the voice that made the threat against
Belli?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you asked to convey that information to Belli?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did that conversation last; do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Not over 3 or 4 minutes. It was the other party speaking. This
happened the afternoon—the day my brother got his horrible verdict.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was Saturday afternoon, March 14?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right; March 14.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what time of the afternoon was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I would say after 2:30—sometime between 2:30 and 4, it seems.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It was a one-sided conversation, I take it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Practically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the essence and the gist of the conversation was that if
Mr. Belli did not leave town he would be injured?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. The voice said something like this, “Mrs. Grant?” I says, “Yes.”
He said, “If Melvin Belli knows what’s good for him, he had better leave town.
They are going to kill him.” Now, I don’t know—this man didn’t sound like a
child and he didn’t sound like an imbecile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ask him who he meant by “they”?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I’ll tell you the truth, I was so shocked at the verdict, and before
I knew it he was off—I was hanging on the phone there by myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he indicate to you in any way who “they” were?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Or who was going to kill him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No. Oh, now I want to tell you about—going back to Monday,
which would be the 16th, there was conversation and, of course, I think I heard
this Sunday too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s March 16?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I think March 16 was on a Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. But I may have heard this Sunday, that the sheriff—and there
has been threats against Belli—and this is another thing I know, whether someone
is on my phone and leaked it out—it wasn’t me, that the sheriff is going to
give Belli a guard out of town, that he has been threatened, but I already knew
that. Then, I got to thinking about all of this and I says, “I hope he leaves,
I don’t want to have this on my mind,” but, I knew when I was in his suite
of rooms—somebody called there Monday afternoon sometime and he went to the
phone for a minute; as a rule someone else was answering the phone, and then
he went in the bedroom there and he answered the phone. He had quite a suite
of rooms—three rooms, I think, and the remark among the people there—they
said the sheriff is going to give him a guard, you know, escort him out of town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You mean you heard that that afternoon.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Too, but it wasn’t—I already had known that from the conversation
Saturday afternoon, it didn’t look good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he comment upon this telephone call that he answered
himself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; he hardly did any talking that afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, you mentioned the telephone call, I wonder why you did so,
that is to say, what import you had put on it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. You want to know the truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; I want to know the truth.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I was not thinking anything about it but he is coming back for a
trial and I told Phil recently, I thought he was going to get his trial transferred
from the Texas Bar Association and I guess he can’t. I wasn’t going to say
anything about it—I figured—he’s never coming back, but now I am a little
scared. I wouldn’t like anything—look, you don’t want a lawyer in a case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me finish about this phone call—is there any other significance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
to that phone call that you heard him answer? You mentioned it in
connection with this.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It didn’t look right when he left—left the phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That’s just an impression, though, he didn’t say anything to indicate
the nature of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You indicated that perhaps, I say—you indicated—the way you
brought it up—it could be inferred perhaps that it was also a threatening
phone call?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No, no; I didn’t mean that at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But, do you know that to be a fact?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No, no; this was merely that the sheriff said he was going to
escort him out of town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you think it was the sheriff on the phone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It could be—that’s what I felt, and shortly after this there was
another phone call came in and he went in and he took the call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you said the rumor or talk was that the sheriff was going
to escort him out of town, I assumed you meant he was going to give him protection,
is that what you meant?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s what I mean, so he doesn’t get hurt. Maybe the sheriff
knows something about this, although he does know—I don’t know. I only
know I was too sick after the verdict to even think about anything, but now that
I know he’s coming back, I asked Phil, I said, “Do you think he’s coming back?”
And he says, “Yes; he’s coming back.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mrs. Grant or Mr. Burleson, do you have any other matter I have
touched upon that you would like to bring up at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. I would like to go into some of these things you have just
questioned her about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Right at first, Mr. Tom Howard did go down and talk to Jack
on Sunday the 24th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And did get a writ of habeas corpus, I believe?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I know nothing of the court procedures of that date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. You don’t know that Judge Brown did set a bond on assault
with intent to commit murder upon Lee Harvey Oswald before this hearing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I understand it was filed in Richardson. I may be wrong. Someone
told me that, that they did file a murder charge against Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Before Oswald was pronounced dead, did you know anything
about Judge Joe B. Brown setting bond and granting a writ to let Jack out on
assault with intent to commit murder?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I <span class="locked">honestly——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Do you or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Then, subsequently, Mr. Howard had myself go up and talk
to Jack—you learned that, did you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I learned there were about three or four or five attorneys that
went up and talked to Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Then, Mr. Belli came in town and at the time, did you hear from
Mr. Tonahill?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. He called you in the middle of the night, I believe?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And did he tell you that he and Mr. Belli were together?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did he just mention himself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He asked me if I had hired an attorney and I said, “I think Earl
got somebody.” And they were discussing it with Percy Foreman, but I was
wrong. They never got to Percy Foreman because Tom Howard never called him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Then Melvin Belli did come in town and met with Mr. Tom
Howard and Mr. Tonahill?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And stayed out at the Cabana Hotel, I believe, the motel out
on Stemmons Freeway?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, I was never at that hotel to visit them—I can’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Earl was in town at the same time Mr. Belli was in town?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I think you are right there—that they were all over there—Earl
was there for a couple of days but I didn’t go there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Then Mr. Belli went down and talked with Jack prior to the
time and he said that he would accept the case, do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I’m sure he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And after talking to Jack, do you remember he said he would
accept the case at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Burleson, may I make this suggestion—of course, this is
not a court hearing, on the other hand, for the sake of the value of the testimony,
I think if you wouldn’t lead her so much that the testimony might have more
weight.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, I’ll tell you, my mind—I’m just about out of my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Yes. Do you know if that is when I became active in the
case—at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I think you came in about—it seems to me—about a week after
this incident—it seems to me that’s when I first met you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And do you know if Mr. Belli brought any attorneys with him
from California?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Do you know who that was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I know he brought Samuel Brody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, after this, there was a bond hearing, I believe; is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And who sat at the counsel table with Mr. Ruby, your brother?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I know you were there and I know Mr. Brody and Tonahill,
Mr. Belli—I think Tom Howard was there right along then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And then, that actually was on one occasion or on two occasions
that that bond hearing was held; or do you recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It seems to me a couple of times—maybe more than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Then bond was denied?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Then, at the time of the change of venue, do you know who
the attorneys were at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It seems to me the same group were still there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Do you recall about that time if anything occurred in connection
with Tom Howard and his connection with the case?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. About the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. No; just about whether or not he continued in the case or did
he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It seems to me at that time—he was leaking information to the
district attorney’s office, he was in the way of Mr. Belli and Mr. Tonahill—at
least they felt that or they told me that. We had found a mistrust in him,
which is close to that time as I can remember, where information has come to us
that Tom Howard is trying to sell a picture of the late President Kennedy
being shot and half of his skull is in the air, to Life magazine, and I think
Billy Woodfield had told that to Earl and Earl told me to get ahold of the
Secret Service, they came out to see me and Elmer Moore, and another gentleman—I
cannot think of the other gentleman’s name—he probably could recall—and
we went in the alley because I don’t know if my place is bugged or not,
and the Secret Service stepped in to either squash the sale of this particular
picture or got ahold of it—the films and everything, and, of course, when Belli
found out, he was sick because he said it don’t look right for an attorney representing
a person to do something like this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right. Anyway—somewhere around <span class="locked">there——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. May I examine her just a little on that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Yes; go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever find out whether it was true that Mr. Howard was
doing this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, since then I heard it was true, but doubly true there’s some
girl that works for one of your departments who heard and who told another
person that there is evidence there is a picture of that kind in existence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have never seen the picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; I haven’t. I also heard several days before the assassination
there was a pamphlet put in all the drugstores where you sell magazines
and was distributed all through the city of Dallas with the late President’s
picture, and the top of its says, “Wanted” and the bottom had a number like
a jailman, you know, a convict, and the day of the assassination, early that
afternoon these distributors had a devil of a time trying to remember all the
places they placed that particular pamphlet, that was for sale for 10 cents or
15 cents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Come back up to his question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I just wanted to explore whether or not it had come to your
knowledge whether the story was the truth or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. This all came to me—call me back on the word “communism”
that I said later on, if you want?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Do you know anything else about this alleged sale of the
picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Nothing, but Earl told me to get ahold of the men here and I
did and I called the office and Elmer Moore came out and I told him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right. Coming back—along about this time—did you,
Earl, and Stanley Kaufman and so forth enter into some kind of a contract with
Mr. Howard where he would withdraw from the case?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did you pay him some money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; the first week he was in, I had a little money and I think
it was when I sold the Vegas Club and I think I had $1,600 and I had bills to
pay but I didn’t pay them and I gave him $200.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. At the time that you terminated his services in the case, did you
pay him some money then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. We gave him a check for $2,000—we gave him $2,700 altogether,
but I gave him $2,000 when he signed the contract to step out of the case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, when the change of venue hearing <span class="locked">started——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. By the way, when I say “I gave him”—that money came also
out of the $23,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, when the change of venue started and the picking of the
jury followed, who were the attorneys then that were sitting there at the counsel
table?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, Belli, Tonahill and yourself—I don’t remember—I think
Sam Brody was sick and went home. However, Mr. Belli brought in a young
gentleman who came and sat for a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Could that have been Mr. Bill Choulous?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And that was out of Mr. Belli’s office?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Then, when it got into the actual trial of the case after the
change of venue lasted about a week, who were the attorneys then during the
picking of the jury?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, Mr. Burleson, Mr. Joe Tonahill, and Mr. Belli did all the
work from picking the jury and through the trial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. The three of them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. The three of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And they continued on through the trial?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And they were the only ones sitting with Jack Ruby at the time
of the verdict?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. You know, I was not in the courtroom all during the trial. They
kept me out in the lobby, but I do know—that is what I heard or saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, within a week after the verdict came in, did you write a
letter to Mr. Belli dismissing him from the case or asking him to withdraw, one
or the other?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. You told him in the letter—what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, I couldn’t reach him by telephone and since he’s traveling
around, and <span class="locked">I’m——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. What did you tell him in the letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Say it again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did you tell him in effect if he didn’t resign you would fire him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, yes; words to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. In other words, he did resign?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think that letter was published in the press, was it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No—I never gave it to them. If it was, it shouldn’t be, because
we only made three copies, the original went to him and one to Mr. Burleson and
one to Tonahill. I didn’t want any more copies around—I didn’t want that—that
was one of the things that bothered me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t know, ma’am, I had the impression that I had seen that
letter through seeing a copy of it in the press.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. If you did—I didn’t see it here, or we didn’t, and we would have
known it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t know—I may be mistaken.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That is one thing—that’s the whole thing—the whole case was
tried in the papers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, after that you were feeling pretty low and sick at that
time, weren’t you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did your family—Earl and Sam and sisters go down to Houston
and talk to Mr. Percy Foreman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. They did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Was a contract drawn up at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did Mr. Foreman know you had Jack Ruby’s power of attorney?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I don’t know what they told him but it was well indicated that I
was now controlling. I took over Earl Ruby’s power.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. What did Mr. Foreman do as to whether or not he made any
announcements as to whether he was the attorney?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, he immediately called in the press. He immediately stated
what he wanted, he took pictures of my family and he said he wanted $5,000
within 10 days and another $5,000 30 days following the 10 days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did he come to Dallas shortly thereafter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. The following week, I think, he came to Dallas—it wasn’t that
weekend, it was the following weekend—am I right—or was it that week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. That week—I think they went down there, if I might help you
a little bit, about Monday.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He came down on a Saturday—I did not see him, but I spoke
with him over the phone. I thought he asked too much money. He wanted
power of attorney and I wasn’t happy about the contract, because these contracts
have <span class="locked">a——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. You had not signed a contract?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Anyway, he went and visited Jack?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. And he wanted Jack to come downstairs to take pictures with him
and our civil attorney, Stanley <span class="locked">Marcus——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Do you mean Stanley Kaufman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Stanley Kaufman, pardon me, wouldn’t permit it. He said “This
is one of the reasons Mrs. Grant and her family didn’t want Belli in the picture.
There has been too much newspaper publicity, radio, and television. He couldn’t
be hurt any worse and there is no sense of you getting into this widespread<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>
publicity,” and Mr. Foreman and Mr. Kaufman got into some squabble there and
Mr. Kaufman left heated, I understand, and Mr. Percy Foreman called me later
that afternoon that he was coming out to see me in the evening. He heard I
had a doctor and I was sick. He didn’t show up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did he make arrangements to meet you the next morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Monday morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. At 9:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. In the lobby of his hotel—the Statler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did you come down?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I came down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. With whom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. With my sister Eileen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did you meet him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I met Mr. Burleson and Mr. Tonahill and we waited, and we went
upstairs and waited—we ordered some coffee and a roll and we waited there
about an hour and 40 minutes. The telephone rang and a news commentator
was on the phone and Mr. Burleson answered it and Mr. Burleson was shocked
from what he heard on the phone, that Mr. Percy Foreman, instead of coming
down to his own room to see us, he went to the newspaper office somewhere or
television or radio—I have no idea, and made a public display of himself, that
he is withdrawing from the case. He indicated that he didn’t get along with the
family and he didn’t like our attorney—our civil attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did you at any time see him personally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I never met him personally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. He then got out of the case and hasn’t had anything to do with
it since?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Then, shortly thereafter, did you have an opportunity to
have a conference with Dr. Hubert Winston Smith?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And did you, Jack, and everybody sign a contract with Dr.
Hubert Smith?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Employing him as chief counsel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes—as chief counsel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And keeping Mr. Tonahill and myself on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Subsequent to that time, did your brother up in Chicago talk
to a Mr. Charles Bellows?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, Mr. Bellows knew about this case right along because
members of the family have known him for 20 or 30 years. I have never known
him—I have heard of him—they went to him, and it’s got so sick and sickening
here that Earl decided, as a friend, he could help us and he is in the background.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Would you say he is in more an advisory capacity?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Just as a good family friend, and he is, I understand, a very
fine great criminal lawyer and he wants to help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you are speaking of the present as well as the past?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. In the past he didn’t intercede because he figured Belli would
be capable. Not that—now, wait a minute—I don’t mean to say that they are
not—it’s just after there is so much to it and he has heard how the case was
handled, and since Earl went to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And Mr. Bellows did make one trip down to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And stayed a matter of hours and then flew on back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. So that to get back to what we wanted to answer the question
he asked you earlier—who are the present attorneys now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Phil Burleson, who is doing most of the work, Mr. Joe Tonahill,
Mr. Hubert Winston Smith, and Mr. Charles Bellows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And Bellows is in an advisory capacity to help any way he can?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right. I’m sorry I forgot about some of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, going to this money situation—as far as you know, recognizing
that you are under oath—as far as you know, there were no contributions
of any large sum other than the one $250 that you have talked about.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That was the largest and the one and only of that kind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Have you heard rumors that the Ruby defense fund received
large sums?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I have heard they got—I think they’ve got close to a thousand
dollars—I may be wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. I mean, have you heard rumors for instance, not too long
ago I heard a rumor that Stanley Marcus gave $25,000; have you heard rumors
similar to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I have heard many of those kind by different people but we
haven’t received it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. You know nothing about any such large sum?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. (Shaking head so as to indicate a negative reply.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. She is shaking her head—the answer is “no”.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh. I’m sorry; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Mainly, the only things you know about personally or have
heard about from other members of the family are the sale to the magazine
of the story, which you have told us about, and the small amount you have told
us about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And you know of no organization that has given any sum?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Not that I know—they may be now—Earl is trying to talk to
some organizations that he belongs to like B’nai B’rith, that he used to belong
to—I don’t know. This is what I know—what I told you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right, but you don’t know of any—say—labor unions or
civic clubs or anything like that that have given any money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I’m sure—I’m sure they haven’t. In fact, wait a minute—Michael
Levin, another good friend of the family—we know him only for 45
years and he’s my older brother’s friend since they were 14 years old and he
has compiled a letter and is asking certain individuals that he knows—doctors,
lawyers, big business people—to contribute, and when I talked to Eileen last,
which was Saturday, she said, “We didn’t receive one—” some of them don’t
even answer the letters and some say they haven’t got it or something else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, there were some reports in the newspapers concerning
the fact that Dr. Hubert Winston Smith was going to raise a lot of money.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, we hope he’s going to raise a lot of money—we hope he
can raise sufficient money to cover legal fees. He’s interested in an academy
institute of law and science.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Have you received any money from Dr. Winston Smith?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No; and I don’t think he’s gotten anything or even worked on
it yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, to clarify my position in the thing—you have paid me,
the family has paid me a total for everything, somewhere in the neighborhood
of $700 or $800 or $900?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. At the most—that’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. You are trying to get more together, though, aren’t you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Well, now, wait a minute—Belli was supposed to pay out of that
$13,000—$2,000—I asked him what he was going to pay you. He didn’t pay
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. As he told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. And I know he didn’t pay you—that was up until the time he
didn’t pay you at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. But I have entered into a verbal contract with you and the
other members of the family for you to compensate me on the appeal and things
of that nature—right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. I’m through, as far as I am concerned, on that point. Now,
is there anything other than what we have talked about here that you want to
clarify <span class="locked">further——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; I want to <span class="locked">clarify——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Wait, let me finish—or do you think that we haven’t talked
about anything that you feel like is important that you would like to state at this
time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. We have never received money from any unethical organization,
labor work, gratis, friends, or relatives such as gangsters or unions or Jack
has gotten one dime out of anybody of that kind, or racketeer money, bookies
or any type of, you know, discriminating businesses of any kind. I know his
finances, I know where he has gotten 99 percent of his money and that is from
members of the family. In fact, they can ask Marian and Earl a good deal
about that.</p>

<p>I also know the night of November 22 when Jack was with me the evening
before—7:15—during that short time he was with me and they were talking
about Oswald, I had made the statement and this is what I said. “Don’t worry,”
and I told it to the FBI and I didn’t see it in the report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. “Don’t worry”—what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. “That lousy Communist”—I’m referring to, and I mean, I assumed
this myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And you said it in Jack’s presence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right. “Don’t worry, that some lousy Communist will get
him before anybody else does.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. The Communist will get him before anybody else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s just what I said and I did not see it in this report—I don’t
think I saw it. I did say it because I already talked to four or five people on
the phone and I’m going to tell you why I said that—everyone on television
and it seems it was Curry, which is our chief of police—says he’s someone
that’s come out with three draft cards, he has been in Cuba and he defected to
Russia and I think my mind is like 40 million other grownups, decided that he
was a Communist sent here for this kind of a thing and the people that I knew
that I speak to on the phone at that time or had been friends with all felt the
same way or talked about it in that way. He couldn’t help but think that. It’s
because what television has presented to the public, and then this thing in the
paper and this was only Friday evening, and I have made that remark—I made
it not only to him, to Pauline Hall, and to Madeline Blainey and to Emma and
to Leo and whoever called I kept talking about that and made that remark, and
I made it not only to him but to these others, and I kept talking about it
because I was imbedded with that in my mind from television. They kept
talking about it—they indicated he had three draft cards, he went to Russia
and they threw him out and they planted him here and he went to Cuba and
he had money and he was going to hire a plane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Okay—anything else you want to go into this to clarify this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Jack has always been a fighter for the Jews. Any—in the Army,
if they look back, he didn’t mind—if you fought and if you cussed and they said
words like sheeny or kike or Jew—he belted it out to them. I know my brother
Jack. He told me of different incidents. One of the things that he loved about
this President—he didn’t care what you were, you were a human being and Jack
felt that this was one time in history that Jews are getting the break. He put
in great Jewish men in office, they were fit to hold the office, and, of course, we
are not Catholics and we never discuss religion in that effect, but my brother
had such a great admiration for this man. It’s unbelievable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack ever tell you why he shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. The truth is this—here recently with his head out—he said he did
it for Jackie and the kids, but I think he’s just looking for a reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No; I’m talking about the first few days?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He didn’t talk—for 10 days he never mentioned it and I never
mentioned it, but in this white overall he had a little picture and on one side is
the late President’s picture in color. It is the most beautiful picture of him
that I have seen. On the other side is a prayer of the Catholics. I have never
seen my brother carry anything like that. He is definitely a good Jew no matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
what people think. He had kissed the President’s picture in front of me—right
in front of me like a baby, and he held that card prayer and his lawyers
have seen him, and I don’t know what denomination they all are—we don’t go
that way. He just held that card there, there’s a little pocket in there—all he
knows—let me put it this way—it maybe was in back of his mind something
that I don’t know or nobody knows, but he loved the President, but he had no
idea of doing this. In the first <span class="locked">place——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. It wouldn’t do any good, I don’t believe, for you to give your
opinions.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. If you know from what he told you, that’s another matter, but
you say he has not told you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. This was a shock out of my wits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Let me ask you this—he didn’t tell you that, then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, something we haven’t gone into and might be relevant
to this—Jack had a great acquaintance with the police, didn’t he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Far greater than the average citizen of this city, unless they were
a wife of a man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Could you tell us what Jack’s attitude was toward the police?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. They were very friendly, he admired them, he thought they were
good people. On many occasions some policeman would have a night off and he
would want to take his wife out on his anniversary and it’s in between paydays,
Jack would let him have $10 and he would say, “I’ll write a check” and so Jack
didn’t want to take the check and sometimes he would hold it 6 years and this
check was still in there which they can see among his possessions. He admired
the police department. He was very close. In fact, he entertained them in the
club on their nights off and I’m positive some have been out to his apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Do you know whether or not Jack knew Officer J. D. Tippit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He said he knew a Tippit but it’s like me—there was a Tipton, a
Tippit, and a Tipin (spelling) p-i-n, and a Tipton, and as far as I was concerned,
even when Payton was talking to me, they were all the same man, until much
later I found out there are three Tippits, there is a Tipton and a Tipin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did Jack, during the period November 22 through the last time
you talked to him on the 23d or the 24th of November, say anything to you about
the fact that Officer Tippit was killed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; on Saturday evening, during this 4-hour period I was very
sick and I, of course—I was physically sick besides mentally sick now over the
assassination of the President, and we talked about the Governor being shot
and different things and he says, “You think you will be all right to go to the
funeral,” but I was so sick.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did he say what funeral?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Oh, yes; he meant the policeman’s funeral—Tippit’s. Of course, a
lot of people don’t know—he went to all of the policemen’s funerals and, of
course, there has been a few funerals—if it was a member of their families and
if he knew the fellows he would go. He was that kind. He tried to pay his
respects to people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. But he did have a conversation about Tippit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. What did he say about Tippit being killed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He said, “You think you will be all right”—and this was Saturday,
and I said, “Yes,” and he said, “Well, do you think you will be all right?” And
I hollered back like—I said, “Yes—yes,” and not to bother me. I was too
sick—I didn’t even want to think of it, but I’ll be honest, all the time he’s talking
to me I had it in my mind—“I’m not going, I’m too sick and I know I ain’t going
to feel good Monday,” see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. In other words, he told you he had planned to go to Tippit’s
funeral on Monday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right—no; he didn’t say “Monday”, he did not say Monday—he
didn’t say the date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Whenever it was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. He said to the funeral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Tippit’s funeral?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Yes; but he says—he saw I was sick and he figured maybe I don’t
want to get out and he says, “Do you think you can go to dinner tomorrow?”
And he does take me to dinner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. But anyway, he had made arrangements or was telling you
that he and you were going to the funeral of Tippit, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s correct—that’s what he thought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. But you didn’t feel up to it physically?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That Saturday I couldn’t see myself going, I’ll tell you, I just
wanted to quiet him down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And as far as you know. Jack did not know Tippit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I don’t—I don’t know, all I could tell you is that Jack lived in
Oak Cliff for a couple of years or maybe a year and a half and Tippit, being of
that area, he could have run into him and known of him slightly. He didn’t
know him as well as other policemen that I know he knows. I know of policemen
much closer than him, but since this all happened, one of my coworkers,
Leo Torti, showed me a magazine and Tippit was in our club sometime—a month
previous to this—previous to his killing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it a picture of Tippit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. It was a picture of Tippit, and he said, “Do you remember he
talked to you up at the front, he was in in September or October or November
sometime.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Was that the Carousel or the Vegas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. The Vegas, and while I looked at him then I remembered that
he looked familiar, but truthfully, you know, after the President’s assassination
and this incident of my brother I didn’t see any newspaper. I didn’t look for
anything to read. I had no television or radio on—I couldn’t take it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Mr. Hubert, I think that is all I have along that line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mrs. Grant, earlier today, as a matter of fact, at the very beginning
or prior to the beginning of the deposition, I showed you a list of names
and telephone numbers and addresses on a document consisting of 37 pages,
marked with a large “E”, and asked you to go through that list and make a check
mark as to every name and number that had any significance to you at all.</p>

<p>Now, you have done so and I am going to ask, if I may, with the consent of
your attorney, that I now read off that list of names as to those names that
you have checked off, and I am going to request the reporter to make a special
list of those that you have checked off and hand it to you so that you may make
comments of your own, and then after consultation with your attorney, draft up
an affidavit as to what comments you have to make with respect to each one
of these people. In other words, you have indicated that the names that have
been checked off have a significance to you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I would like you to prepare notes and with the assistance of your
attorney, draft an affidavit as to what significance each one of these names has.
I understand that it will be perhaps a matter of 2 weeks or so before you can
get that because there are quite a number of names.</p>

<p>Now, I will read those names so that the record will show which of the names
you have marked off. I understand that as to those you have not marked off,
those names have no significance to you; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right—I can’t relate them to anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. May I make a suggestion—it may be a little time consuming,
but if she could look back through that now that she has had an opportunity
to testify and recall many, many things that she probably hasn’t thought of in
some time—she could very quickly look at the ones she didn’t check?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. Is it possible that some of those are license plate numbers—could
you tell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They seem to be mostly telephone numbers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Yes; ma’am—that’s right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. May I explain something to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes; please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. All right. Jack would be driving along in his car and there
would be a young lady drive up to the right of him. If she didn’t have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
marriage ring and she looked cute and he thought she might like to see a little
night life he would let her pass—he would look at her license number and copy
the number and find out in the city hall where to send her—her name and address
and the telephone—a complimentary card to come to the Vegas Club—he as a
host.</p>

<p>Now, I told this to Payton and the other people and he would send these
people cards because girls would come to the club and ask me, “Where is Mr.
Ruby?” And I would say, “He’s not here.” And they said, “Well, he sent
me this complimentary card.” Once I said something to him about it and he
said “Oh, I sent this to a girl,” and I never thought anything about it. Finally,
when he was arrested and I knew they found a lot of numbers, I said to him,
“What are these numbers for?” And he said, “You know they are license plate
numbers.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I see your point—it might be better if we gave her the whole
list.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I’m not going to steal it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I can’t give you this list but I can get these names run off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Suppose we do it that way and it may be that in time she can
reflect better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Suppose we do it that way, then, and instead of doing it the
way we have agreed, I will supply you with a list of all of these names and ask
that you look at all of them and possibly you will see some that you have overlooked?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That’s right—there may be one or two that I have overlooked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And I will ask you, then, to give us an affidavit as to the significance
of any of these.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I will be happy to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I would ask that you give us the affidavit only upon your own knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Not as to what she has heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, if she indicates it is what she knows from her own knowledge
as apart from what she has heard.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. These are mostly strippers and waitresses that I know or have
known, or comedians. Listen, what happened to the two boxes of names and
addresses that they took out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t know, ma’am. It may well be that these are they.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. That isn’t enough.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion between counsel and the witness as to the names shown on the
list heretofore referred to.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. May I ask you—do you want this in one single affidavit, paragraph
by paragraph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I don’t think so. I think that the affidavit could be in the usual
form.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. What I am asking is, do you want a single affidavit as to each
one of the names here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think not, I think the usual affidavit form—one that says that—having
been handed a list and so forth, that she has the following comment to
make on each and then in numerical sequence, and as to the rest of them there
is no significance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And one notary signature will be sufficient?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And then there will be just one instrument?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. I do want to say this: Do you know Jack in his early teens and
in the early thirties—he and these bad boys he later on disassociated himself
with, they were people in the neighborhood—broke up Bund meetings in Chicago—do
you know Chicago at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. For the record, I have no other questions to ask.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I haven’t either. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>. All right.</p>

<h2 id="SAM_RUBY">TESTIMONY OF SAM RUBY</h2>
</div>

<p>The testimony of Sam Ruby was taken at 10:55 a.m., on May 29, 1964, in the
office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Leon D. Hubert, Jr., assistant counsel of the President’s
Commission. Sam Ruby was accompanied by his attorney, Phil Burleson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This is the deposition of Sam Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruby, my name is Leon D. Hubert. I am a member of the advisory staff
of the General Counsel of the President’s Commission on the Assassination of
President Kennedy. Under the provisions of Executive Order 11130, dated
November 29, 1963, the joint resolution of Congress No. 137, and the rules of
procedure adopted by the President’s Commission in conformance with the executive
order and the joint resolution, I have been authorized to take a sworn
deposition from you. I state to you now that the general nature of the Commission’s
inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate and report upon the facts relevant to
the assassination of President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of Lee
Harvey Oswald. In particular, as to you, Mr. Ruby, the nature of the inquiry
today is to determine what facts you know about the death of Oswald and of the
life of your brother, Jack Ruby, and any other pertinent facts you may know
about the general inquiry.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruby, I believe that you appear here today by virtue of a letter addressed
to you by Mr. J. Lee Rankin, general counsel of the staff of the President’s
Commission. Did you receive that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you remember the day that you did receive it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I believe it was Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Under the rules of the Commission you are entitled to a 3-day
written notice prior to the taking of your deposition, but the rules also provide
that you may waive that notice if you wish and testify right now. Do you wish
to do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I do—I wish to testify.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I would like the record to show also that Mr. Phil Burleson,
attorney at law, is present and representing Mr. Sam Ruby; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, will you stand and take the oath, please? And raise your
right hand.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Will you state your full name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Samuel David Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How old are you. Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. 51.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where do you reside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. At 11616 Jamestown Road, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I am a washing machine repairman at washaterias.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Ruby, you have heretofore been interviewed by the FBI on
four different occasions and I would like you to tell me about those. In order
that we may proceed in that way, I wish to identify an interview of you on
November 24, 1963, by FBI Agents Sayres [spelling] S-a-y-r-e-s, and Eckenrode.
That interview consists of six pages—on the first page I have marked on the
right margin the following: “Dallas, Texas, May 29, 1964, Exhibit No. 1, deposition
of Sam Ruby,” and I have placed my name beneath that and on the right-hand
lower corner of each of the succeeding five pages I have placed my initials
for the purpose of identification.</p>

<p>Now, I ask you if you have had occasion to read this document which I have
identified as Exhibit No. 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I would like you to express your opinion as to the correctness
of that report of the interview?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. They are correct as far as that is concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any changes or any suggestions or modifications in
any way that you wish to make with respect to that statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I think he has them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. On page 6; in previously going over this, Mr. Hubert, I think
there are some things he would like to comment on and I will ask him about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. On page 6, the first paragraph—there is a statement that “This
man’s name was Leo, last name unknown. Jack fired this man because he said
he was stealing from him.”</p>

<p>I’ll ask you whether or not you now have found out or since that time, have
found out Leo’s last name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I found out his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Torti [spelling] T-o-r-t-i; I believe is the way he spells it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And as to the second statement there about Jack firing this
man, do you now know that that was not the situation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes: I found out that he was not quite competent as Jack would
have him and there were a few things that he didn’t take care of, in other words,
when my brother told him to do it and he neglected to do a few things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And that was the reason for the firing of Torti rather than
stealing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And subject to that correction you told Mr. Hubert, everything
else appeared to be correct, as I understand it now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is it correct to state that when you made the statement that you
have just modified on page 6 of Exhibit No. 1 that you had the impression that
the man had been fired because he had been stealing from Jack and that impression
has been clarified since that; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How was it clarified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, since talking to Jack and at the time—Jack mentioned a
few things that—when I come to the club, which I did a few times to visit him
and see the show and to watch the admission being taken and put in the register
properly, and that gave me the impression that maybe he just wanted to see
that maybe Leo didn’t forget to do those things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have since talked to your brother Jack and he has clarified
this matter, so that you are now able to state that your present understanding
is that it was not because of an allegation of stealing, but rather because he
was incompetent; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right; and Jack’s idea about managing the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I show you another report of an interview of you by FBI
Agent Alfred Sayres on November 27, 1963, which I have marked for identification
as follows: “Dallas, Texas, May 29, 1963, Exhibit No. 2, deposition of Sam
Ruby,” and I have signed my name and all of which appears in the right margin
of this one page document and I ask you the same question with respect to that,
that is, if it is correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Which paragraph is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. The entire document—I am speaking of the entire document—I
think you have just read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. That’s the one you said was all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span> (reading instrument referred to). I think I recall when Jack was
hospitalized, I think it was in Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right, let me ask you a question—in regard to the second
paragraph which says—“He said he knows of no time when Jack Ruby has ever
been hospitalized for any reason.” Does something come to your mind in reference
to the hospitalization of Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; he was struck in back of the head, I think he was scalping
tickets at one of the sporting events—at football or one of those events in
Chicago—and the police officer told him not to scalp, told him to leave the
premises where the sporting event was being held, and Jack refused to do so,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span>
and anyway—I don’t know what the deal was, but Jack was hit on the back of
the head with a club or something like that, and he had a big bandage on the
back of his head, and he was hospitalized then, but I don’t remember what year
it was—I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, with that amplification or correction of Exhibit No. 2,
is the exhibit otherwise correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, they tell me—I talked to the family and they say that my
mother was hospitalized in Elgin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right; let me ask you—you are now referring to the third
paragraph and a sentence in there that says, “This was the Dunning Hospital
on Irving Boulevard in Chicago?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. You have subsequently found out that it may have been a
different hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right; after I talked to some members of the family and they say
it was in Elgin, Ill., which is a mental hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And are there any other corrections or additions you want to
make to that statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I found out since, that my sister, Eileen, had somewhat of a
nervous breakdown since she came here to visit during the trial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Let me ask you—you are now referring to the last paragraph
that says, “He knows of no other indications of any mental illnesses in his
family.” What have you found out since you made that statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. My sister Eileen was treated by a doctor during—following a
nervous breakdown some years ago—we found out during the course of the
trial when she was here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did you find out anything about Earl having any type of
mental disorder, either in the service or subsequent thereto?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, here it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. You have that in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know where your sister was hospitalized or treated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. My sister Eileen Kaminsky—no; I don’t, but she did mention she
was having some difficulty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you got that information from her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you didn’t know it at the time of the interview covered by
Exhibit No. 2, to wit: November 27, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Other than that, this document is correct, that is Exhibit No. 2,
is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I show you Exhibit No. 3, which you have already read,
and that Exhibit No. 3 is an interview of you by Alfred Sayres, having been
dated November 29. I have marked it for identification as follows: “Dallas,
Tex., May 29, 1964, as Exhibit No. 3 to the deposition of Sam Ruby,” and I have
signed my name below it and I ask you if that document is correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span> (reading instrument referred to). Well, the first paragraph there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Let me ask you—in reference to the first paragraph starting
with “Samuel David Ruby, 11616 Jamestown Road, Dallas, Tex., advised that
he has no interest financial or administrative in the S &amp; R Corp. He further
advised that he has no interest financial or administrative in the Carousel Club
or in the Club Vegas in Dallas, Tex., which clubs are operated by his brother,
Jack Ruby. He further advised that he is not aware that his name has ever
appeared on any document as an officer in the S &amp; R Corp., or in any way in
the operation of the Carousel Club or the Club Vegas.”</p>

<p>Have you, since you made that statement back on the 29th of November 1963,
been informed of some facts that are contrary to what you stated at that time,
and do you wish to explain to Mr. Hubert what that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I found out from Ralph Paul, who was also a stockholder, that
I was a member of the corporation and that I was issued shares of stock in the
S &amp; R Corp., but I have never seen them, I have never received them or have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>
never seen any of the corporation papers, so I am just taking his word for it,
and I still don’t know, but they say it and also in the Vegas Club, I hold a
chattel mortgage on that, which has not fully been paid off. I don’t know
whether you would consider that a financial interest in that or not. Jack never
paid me off the full amount.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does that have to do with reference to a loan that had been made
by you to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And at an earlier date upon which you got a judgment in your
favor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, we will touch upon that a little later, and I think that
will be clarified. It is a fact, I take it, until you were advised by Mr. Paul
that your name appeared on the corporate papers, you didn’t know anything
about it until then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; this last, this third paragraph, I think I found out from my
brother Earl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. All right, let me make reference to a particular sentence in
there. In the third paragraph of the statement, “He further advised that
sometime during the fall or early winter of 1960, his sister, Marion Caroll,
visited in Dallas and while here loaned Jack Ruby a fairly large sum of money.
He said she later regretted making this loan and his brother Earl came to
Dallas sometime in the spring of 1961 for the purpose of recovering the amount
of this loan for Marion. He said he does not know if Earl was successful in
this attempt or if Earl paid Marion the amount of the loan and thereby became
a creditor of Jack Ruby.”</p>

<p>What have you found out since making that statement that might make some
difference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, part of that I believe is true—Earl did come down here to
try to get some of that money back, but I also found out that he let Jack have
some money of his own because Jack was having some financial difficulties with
the Carousel Club. It was changed then and I think it was the Sovereign Club
or the Carousel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who did you find that out from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. From Earl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he say how much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; he didn’t say—he may have said, but I don’t recall, but I know
he says he let him have some money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, are there any other changes or corrections to Exhibit
No. 3?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; if he has an interest—I don’t know whether he has an interest—if
it’s in writing—he may have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Let me ask you—are you referring to the fourth paragraph
that says, “He says he does not know whether or not Earl Ruby has a financial
interest in the Carousel Club or the Club Vegas at Dallas, but if he does have,
this interest may have arisen out of the above-mentioned loan.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; that’s right—that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That is correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; that is correct, but I don’t know about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. That’s what you have heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that all as to Exhibit No. 3, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s right—well, <span class="locked">now——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Let me ask you this—you are now referring to the last paragraph.
“He concluded by stating that he has no knowledge of the financial or
corporate structures of the S &amp; R Corporation or of the Carousel Club or Club
Vegas in Dallas, Tex.” Do you want to change that in the light of what you
have heard since that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let’s put it this way—when that statement was given, that was
true, you did not have that knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What you want to say now is that you have found out something
since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Will you tell us what it is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I found out that a certain amount of shares were issued to me in
the S &amp; R Corp. and that I was a vice president in the corporation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you did not know that at the time you made this statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whom did you find out those facts from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. From Ralph Paul.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that is the only source of your information, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever seen the shares?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I never have seen them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever seen any of the books or papers of the corporation
that would indicate it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But your sole source of information as to your present statement
is the information obtained from Ralph Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you made any other inquiry about the matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, we tried looking through the Carousel Club files up there—they
had these metal files. We went through those and we couldn’t find any
papers, any corporation papers and no one of the attorneys seemed to have them
at the time and Stanley Kaufman, who was a personal friend of his, and he is an
attorney here in town, he didn’t have them and he didn’t know where they were,
and we couldn’t locate them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you invest any money for the purchase of the shares of stock
which apparently might have been issued to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I didn’t invest any. Jack may have transferred some of the
money that he owed me as a financial transaction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What you mean is that he owed you some money and he may have
issued the stock to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. To cover that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. As a way of paying the loan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But in any case he didn’t tell you he was doing so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you any further comments as to Exhibit No. 3?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I show you a document which purports to be a report of an
interview of you by Alfred Sayres, FBI agent, on December 5, 1963, and for the
purpose of identification I have marked that document, “Dallas, Tex., May 29,
1964, Exhibit No. 4 of the deposition of Sam Ruby,” and I have signed my name
below that, and it consists of one page, and I ask you the same question with
respect to that document?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, this first paragraph—I found out that he had—that he did
make a trip to Cuba.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Let me ask you—you are referring to the first paragraph which
starts off: “Samuel David Ruby, 11616 Jamestown Road, Dallas, Tex., advised
telephonically that he knows of no trip to Cuba made by Jack Ruby at any time.
It was explained to Mr. Ruby that if such a trip were made it had been alleged
Jack Ruby made the trip with a gambler from Fort Worth, Texas. He suggested
that such a person may have been a man by the name of McWillie whom he has
heard mentioned as a gambler and a friend of Jack Ruby.” What do you now
know in reference to that, that you have found out since that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, from Jack himself—this was in the Dallas County Courthouse
in jail, that Mr. McWillie sent him the airplane tickets for him to go
to Cuba and to be his guest while he was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you get that information from Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know—sometime ago—I believe it was during the trial—during
the course of the trial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You visited him at the Dallas County Jail, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And during the course of that conversation he told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ask him about it or did he volunteer the information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I asked him about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you think that was during the trial but before the verdict?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. About what part of the trial—do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It was more or less during the beginning of it—most likely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In February?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Probably was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you anything else to say about Exhibit No. 4?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Everything is all right on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I understand that your name and Jack’s—the family name
was Rubenstein.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that you changed your name to Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was that change made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In Chicago, Ill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was by a regular court proceeding in the courts of
Illinois?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And did you know that Jack had also changed his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I didn’t know definitely whether he changed it legally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you know that your brother Earl had changed his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. We changed ours at the same time. We were in business together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What I wanted to ask you is whether or not the change of name
of you and Earl and Jack was by a common understanding, that you all would
change your name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; just Earl and I had a common understanding. We were in
business together at the same time and we used the same attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What business was that that you were in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. We were in the advertising specialty manufacturing business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the name of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Earl Products Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it a corporation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; just a company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A trade name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. A trade name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was Jack in that company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He was. He was in the company for about 2 years, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was during what years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. 1946 and 1947.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, how did he come to leave it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. We had a little difference as to the policies of the company and
Earl and I more or less agreed on the way it should be run and Jack had other
ideas, and, of course, when we couldn’t agree, we bought him out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What did you pay him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I believe it was about $14,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, was that paid in cash?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; it was cash.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After you bought him out and you paid him in cash, did he come
to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Would you say he came almost immediately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; in fact I think he may have made some trips here before
we sold out, before he sold out to us—I’m not sure about that, but it seems like
he had come down here to visit my sister Eva—Eva L. Grant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know of your own knowledge whether or not when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
got here he had approximately $14,000 in cash, that is to say, when he came to
Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. <span class="locked">Well——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Let me put it this way—you knew he had the $14,000—you don’t
know whether he had any debts or anything that would have consumed that
$14,000, is that what you are saying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, when did you move to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In 1955—I moved here in July 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And what was the occasion for your coming here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I sold out to my brother Earl in March of 1955 and at that time my
youngest boy, Brion, had a little asthma difficulty and my sister Eva, who was
residing in Chicago at the time, suggested that I come to Dallas and look into
the building of homes in Dallas. She had some friends who were in the business
of building homes, and I did build one residence in Oak Cliff, that is part of
Dallas, in association with this lady friend of hers, and subsequently this
woman I built the home with, she liked the home so well she bought it from
me and I realized at the time that these building tradesmen here were kind of
hard to get along with. In other words, they—some of them would drink on the
job and material would be missing from the job and I thought I would rather get
into something else that I was more familiar with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, as I understand it, then, after you sold your interest to
Earl, you made the decision to move to Dallas on a permanent basis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I came down here for a visit first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you decide to make this your home—to make Dallas
your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. After I sold out the company to Earl in March, I came down here
in April.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is that what you considered to be your permanent move to
Dallas—in April?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I came down here for a visit and I decided I liked Dallas very
much and I went back up north and, of course, at that time I was in the business
of building this home and I told my wife—I called her on the phone and told her
that we are going to move to Dallas and I went up there in the latter part of
June and helped pack our furnishings and belongings and had them moved down
here by truck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You had already finished building the home here you were talking
about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I was in the process of building it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After you moved down here and that was in the summer of 1955,
as I understand you, and after you had finished this building venture which
you decided you didn’t want to continue in, what business did you go into by
way of making a living?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I went into—it was also the advertising specialty business—then
with two fellows who were at that time engaged in it. They had a company under
the trade name of Atlas American Specialties Co., I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the name of the two men you are speaking of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. One was Sam Lasser (spelling) L-a-s-s-e-r, and the other fellow
was named Norman Weisbrod.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you have covered those transactions in your statements.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I believe I have—I don’t think they asked me those questions, although
I did mention that they were friends of Jack’s.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But you actually were business partners with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did that last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That lasted until June 1956.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, what was the occasion of breaking that up, or what
happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. We manufactured a product that wasn’t engineered or designed
properly and we had a lot of rejects and we were having to pay freight both ways
and——<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the product?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It was this plastic spinner that you see on these wires in front of
service stations and used car lots and the weather—when they are spinning
around would force them to crack in half and they would fall on the cars and
maybe damage them and they weren’t satisfied with them and we found out
later that this man who made our mould for us didn’t design it properly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where are Lasser and Weisbrod now, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. They are partners in the wholesale distributing business of sunglasses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In what city?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In Dallas—I believe the name is Mode (spelling) M-o-d-e, Imports.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you have occasion to see those people frequently?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I haven’t seen those people in maybe—maybe for about 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. They were friends of Jack’s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did Jack get you interested in this venture with these two men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, he introduced me to them and he did say that they had a
very good business and that they were hard working fellows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you invest any money with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. $3,500.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you dissolved, did they buy you out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No: the whole company was dissolved. We just liquidated it. We
paid all of our debts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any part of the investment returned to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, you lost the $3,500 in that venture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. After that was completed, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In the latter part of 1956, I investigated this coin-operated washateria
business and I succeeded in purchasing and in installing a new coin-operated
washateria at 3608 Oak Lawn in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the name of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It was Speedy Wash, I believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was just a trade name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you borrowed some money from some banks to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I borrowed some money from some banks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have any other ventures since that, or is that still in
existence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I lost my lease—my lease was up and Ward’s Drug Store next
door somehow managed to get the lease on the store and, of course, I had to
vacate and discontinue that place, but while I had that place of business I purchased
the Bonnie Washateria at 2002 East 11th Street in Dallas and I also
purchased another washateria at 2524 North Fitzhugh in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you still operate those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I sold both of those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, this one at 2425 North Fitzhugh was the Ruby Washateria
and I sold that 2 years ago last March—let me see—that would be 1962, wouldn’t
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In March 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was the last one you sold?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; that was the Ruby Washateria. Then, the Bonnie Washateria,
which was at 2002 East 11th Street, I sold just last December, I believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whom did you sell that to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. To a Mr. George Cernorsky.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the purpose of your selling it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I had a lot of competition—there was a new washateria
opened up there on the street from me about a block away next to a supermarket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>
and I was sort of in an isolated corner myself and also I was at that
time engaged in extensive repair work and I tried to go more into the repair
of washing machines and I thought it was taking a lot of my time and I wasn’t
making any money there and in fact I was losing money, and I thought—why
have something like that on your hands and I would rather devote my time to repair
work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that’s what you have done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that’s what you are doing now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; but I also since that time—I also purchased a little manufacturing
business in Coppell, Tex., which of all days, I purchased it on November
20, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What kind of business is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It was a little stuffed animal business and the name of the company
was the Autographic Mascots that they use around these colleges and universities
and high schools—all of these schools have little mascots, you know, and the
purpose was to have these kids—these various classes—have their classmates
autograph them as sort of a remembrance or souvenir of their school days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Are you still operating that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; we sold that—we just sold that recently—April the 15th this
party took over complete possession of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Whom did you sell it to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. To Mrs. M. Frances Cole, I believe her name is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. C-o-l-e (spelling)?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is she operating it now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, I understand that you loaned some money to Jack in 1955;
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much and under what circumstances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, he said he was having difficulty in paying his Federal excise
taxes and I let him have $1,000, and then sometime later—that was probably
in May or June of 1955 when I let him have the $1,000, and then sometime
later—that was probably May or June when I let him have the $1,000 and later
that summer, it may have been in July or August, I let him have $4,500, and
he had some more difficulty with the Government on his Federal excise tax
and he had to pay off these taxes or they would have padlocked his club—it
was the Vegas Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When you made these loans to Jack, did you receive any evidence
of the loan, such as a note?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir; I had him make out a bill of sale to me for the Vegas
Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that recorded in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I think I still have it at home—I think I still have it at home.
I don’t remember whether it was recorded or not—the attorney made it out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I understand that you had to file a legal proceeding against
Jack in order to recover your money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. A judgment for it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that a contested suit—did you file suit against him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. This bill of sale, was that sort of a security device or actual
transaction of sale?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It was an actual transaction of sale and also a security.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What you did—you sued on the note, I assume, that was involved;
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; we sued that I was the legal owner of the business and that
he told me he would—in December he said he would purchase the club from me.
He wasn’t satisfied with me as a partner and he said he was going to buy me
out, but he failed to meet his financial promises and so I kept calling him and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span>
so I wasn’t getting any satisfaction and I hired an attorney. Mr. Harold I.
Berman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then he filed suit on your behalf?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he obtained a judgment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that a contested suit or did it go by default?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It was contested—he had his attorney there, Mr. Klepak.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He actually went to trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you won the case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the result of the judgment was that you were declared to be
the owner of the Vegas; is that it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, that Jack should—he agreed to pay me the amount of money
he owed me, which at that time amounted to about $4,500. He had paid me
some money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was that after you obtained the judgment that he agreed to pay
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, it was during the judgment—that’s the way we settled it
in court.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, the case was compromised, was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And the compromise was that he agreed to pay you—what sum
of money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. $4,500—that was the balance that he owed me at the time—at that
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then didn’t he then execute a note to you or was that just
simply part of the judgment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That was part of the judgment and we have a legal document
showing that the judgment was entered and agreed upon and I think was signed
by the judge, and I have that document at home. It’s still on file in the records
building—it has never been removed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Has the $4,500 been paid off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How much is yet due upon it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, about $1,300 or so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Was it to be paid off in installments or any period of time or
just what was the arrangement or compromise made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I believe he gave me a thousand dollars in the Court that day
and they had to take a hundred dollars off for his attorney—his attorney wanted
a hundred dollars from that thousand dollars, and so I only received $900 and
the rest was, I believe, to be paid off in $200 monthly installments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So, that in any case there now remains a balance of $1,300 due
on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you ever live in Youngstown, Ohio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. During what period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. From 1939 to 1941. I registered there for the draft.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was your occupation there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I was what they call a siding applicator—you know—these siding
manufacturers like Johns-Manville and Ruberoid and these various other siding
manufacturers. I worked for a construction company and we secured contracts
and I was one of their—what they call—shingle applicator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the name of the company? Do you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The National Improvement Company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you work with it only?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And that was for a period of 2 years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I think it was 3 years—1939, inclusive—1939 to 1941.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then you went into the draft?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. And then I worked in Chicago for a few months and then I went
and enlisted in the Navy in February 1942, and they turned me down because
of my eyes, and I went to the draft board and tried to find out how soon my
number was coming up and they took my name and address and it was within
the next few days that they let me know that they wanted me to come down
for an examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know Ralph Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long have you known him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, practically since I have been in Dallas—since 1955, I would
say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How did you meet him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Through Jack at the Vegas Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you ever in partnerships with him yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir—I forgot to mention that. I just recall that now. We
were in an ice cream business venture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the name of that; do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I think it was the Rainbow Ice Cream Palace.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Where was it located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In Wynnewood Shopping Center.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What happened to that venture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It just wasn’t successful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did it last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, let’s see—about 4 months I believe—March, April, May, and
June—I think it only lasted 4 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you had any other business arrangements or enterprises
with Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No—but I was in another business with a fellow named Robert
Eisman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I-s-m-a-n [spelling]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No—[spelling] E-i-s-m-a-n.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was that business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Washateria—we were partners in a coin-operated business—washateria
at the time—two of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the name of this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. One was the—what was the name on it—it was on 1713 South
Ervay Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was different from the other two you have mentioned here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How long did that arrangement last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, about 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was it dissolved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. This is 1964—that must have been in March 1960, or 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Is this man Eisman still in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; he’s living in Fort Worth at the present time—he is in the
washateria—not washateria, but coin-operated washing machines at the present
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What caused you to dissolve that arrangement with Mr. Eisman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. We had an awful lot of vandalism there in that neighborhood.
They cut down water hoses and they would break into the machines and there
was just too much vandalism to be profitable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Have you ever been charged or convicted of any felonies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What has been your relationship with Jack since you came to live
in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. How do you mean that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Well, as brothers—do you visit socially often—you have told us
about some of the financial matters between you and I was wondering what was
the personal relationship between you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, outside of that difference we had about the club, he used
to come over and visit us for the Jewish holidays and sometimes we would
invite him over for an evening to dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. On the average, how often did you see him a year, for instance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I would see him, oh, maybe anywhere from three to six times
a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have other contacts with him by phone or otherwise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; we talked to him on the phone on different occasions. There
was nothing important—I mean—just about maybe something about his family
or how he was doing or inquire about the children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What about your relationship with his sister, Mrs. Eva Grant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I have seen her more often and we are off and on like
brothers and sisters and we argue at different times and maybe in a week or
so we’ll forget about it and make up. She has her own views on things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you have occasion to see Jack during the period September
25 through November 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. September—you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes—September 25, yes, I believe I did. I may have seen him at
the club one night and then on one occasion, I remember it was the week of
Halloween, because the man I was working for went out of town and Jack
called me—he called me—I don’t know whether he called me or my wife called
me, and wanted me to go to Fort Worth with him to look at this twistboard
factory which he was handling as a distributor at that time and I wasn’t too
anxious to go, but he insisted and he said maybe if that distributing business
went all right, he would like me to become interested in that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go with him then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I did. I had some work but I thought I could make it up
either later in the day or the following day—just repairing washing machines.
I was working for a man that had three washaterias at the time and I took a
ride with him to Fort Worth to see this manufacturing plant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you enter into the venture with Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know to what extent he did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; he told me that he was a distributor for these boards and he
was thinking maybe of going into the manufacture of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did he tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. At that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know whether your brother Earl had any interest in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, sir; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You don’t know to this moment whether he does?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Jack never mentioned that Earl might be interested?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No—no; he never mentioned one way or the other whether Earl
would be interested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you recall whether you had any contact whatsoever with
Jack during the periods, say, from the 16th of November through the 24th of
November—that would be about the week before the President died until Oswald
was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I think he called me on the phone a few times and wanted
me to go visit my sister Eva in the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, sir; I didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Now, do you remember any other contacts between you and
Jack other than the one you just mentioned concerning visiting your sister in
the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, he may have called me twice on the phone—I didn’t see him
during that period. The last time I saw him was the week of Halloween—it
was on a Wednesday, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, then, the last time you saw him was before
Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was approximately a month or 4 weeks before Oswald was
shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s right; before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you recall at least one telephone conversation which you
have just made reference to about visiting your sister in the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes—he was very upset about me not going. I promised him I
would go and then I happened to be very busy working for this washateria
owner and I thought it was more important I stay at my job and maybe go at
night, but he became very upset about me not going and sort of became abusive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. That was all over the phone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he contact you after the President was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, sir—no, he didn’t contact me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did your sister do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. In other words, between November 22d and the time Oswald
was shot, you had no communication of any sort whatsoever with either your
sister, Eva Grant, or your brother, Jack Ruby; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were you aware of his reaction to the President’s death during
the period November 22 through November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, sir; I had no idea. I was busy at the time—I was working for
this man, Mr. Dean, and I also was doing repair work at night and I was working
pretty late at night and I would get home late and get up early in the
morning and had to be at the job at 8 and so my days and nights were fully
occupied at that time and previous to that, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. I think you have stated in one of these statements that Mr. Paul
said he was going to give you 50 percent of the stock of the S &amp; R Corp.; did
he say why he was going to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir; that was after Judge Sterrett denied an application for a
new license and he wanted to turn his 50 percent over to me so that I should
have the obligations of the club, which I wasn’t in favor of because I didn’t
have the financial backing to take it over. I have never received that 50 percent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Why did he want to give it to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. So that he wouldn’t have to assume any financial responsibilities
incurred by the corporation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And you refused it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I didn’t refuse him at the time, but I didn’t agree one way or the
other, but I suggested my sister Eva take over the 50 percent of the corporation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Were any shares of stock ever delivered to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, sir; not any shares.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Mr. Burleson, do you have any questions you would like to ask
of Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Yes. First, Sam, have you, since this incident occurred back
on November 24, 1963, had an occasion to have any threats on your life, your
well-being, your future or that of your children, or your family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, there was one man that called and said he was a friend of
Jack’s and he wanted to come over and he said that he was from up North—I
believe he was from Minnesota and he had come down here to look for a job—he
wanted to get a job and he was a friend of Jack’s and it didn’t sound sensible
or logical and he had talked to my wife, and we didn’t give him our address or
any other information and he said he wanted to talk to Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. But you have had no direct threats?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was this occurrence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The conversation—well, my wife would know more about that, I
believe, since she talked to him—I believe it was in December.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have never heard any more from this individual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, you have been visiting Jack recently, have you not, in jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Can you tell us what you found Jack’s condition to be since the
verdict and at the present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, to be frank with you, I always thought there was something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">501</span>
odd about Jack, but I thought he was just the type of a person that’s hard to
get along with and that was before—years ago—but since I have been visiting
him lately, his mental condition has deteriorated very rapidly. He keeps saying
that people are being killed in the streets and he hears screams in the building
of people being slaughtered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Are these just people or are these Jewish people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, he says, “People,” and then he says “Jewish people” and he
always imagines that Earl is killed and his children’s bodies are being dismembered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does he say anything about Eva?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; he tells me to leave and sell my home and get out of Dallas.
He says that the police hate him here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does he tell you to do anything as far as self-destruction is
concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; he has done that quite a few times. He says he is going to
take his life and I’ve tried to talk him out of it, and tell him everything will be
all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. He said he was going to take his own life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; and I have never heard him talk like that before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Does he appear to be normal to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; he has that—I don’t know how to describe his look, but he
has sort of a look of a person that is being tortured or tormented by something
and I don’t know what you would call it, but it is sort of a—he has that look
in his face of not seeing you, like he is looking—staring at you but not seeing
you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Does he recognize you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; he does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When did you last see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Last Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How many times since his conviction have you seen him prior to
last Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I have seen him at least once a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And this condition that you have described that he has, did it
exist right after the conviction or was it a progressive matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, it has been progressive and during the course of the bond
hearing and the change of venue and the jurors and the trial itself—he didn’t
seem to communicate with me very much. He didn’t have anything to say to
me, so to speak, like he didn’t have all of his faculties, you might say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Now, let me ask you—do you know anything about the financial
situation of the so-called defense fund—the money that has come in for the
defense of Jack Ruby, have you had anything to do with it yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I had nothing to do with it, but I understand they sold a story.
Do you want to know about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Well, we know about that. That’s the newspaper story that
this Woodfield fellow bought?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Have you personally received any money from any source
from persons who have contributed it to you to use in the defense fund?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. You have not received even any money in the mail; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Not one penny.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And no one has given you any to be utilized for the defense?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Have you contributed any of your own, other than the expense
that you have been out personally during the trial and things of that
nature, have you contributed any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. And have you heard from any members of the family who are
maybe more aware of it than you are that many large sums have come in,
other than this one for the sale of the news story?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes: I heard that one come in from one of Jack’s friends in
Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Is that the $250?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who was the friend, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Kelman, I think his name is Joe Kelman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know that man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Not personally; I met his brother years ago. His brother was a
personal friend of Jack’s, Morris Kelman, and they are, I believe, in the auto
windshield glass manufacturing business in Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Then, I believe there was another check of some sum from
Walter Winchell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Do you know how much that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. My sister Eva said it was for $100.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. You were reported as saying to some news media that there
was several thousand dollars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I didn’t say that. I said it was very generous—I didn’t give any
amount. I didn’t even say whether it was a dollar or what amount it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Do you know of any other sums of money that may have come
in, of any substantial sum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. That’s all I have. I need to go off the record for a moment. I
need to talk to Mr. Ruby on a matter that we had not completely discussed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right. Would you like to leave the room for your conference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Yes; please.</p>

<p>(At this point counsel Burleson and the witness, Sam Ruby, left the conference
room for approximately 10 minutes, returned thereto, and the proceedings of
Mr. Ruby’s deposition continued as follows.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. I would like to go back on the record and ask you, Mr. Ruby,
is there anything you would like to bring out—anything that you would like to
tell Mr. Hubert here on any version of the case, either something we have already
talked about, to amplify, explain that, or either something new—some new area
that you feel like that he would be interested in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I don’t know, except that I talked to some of the people from
the Liquor Commission, the Texas State Liquor Commission, and they think
that he may have felt sorry for the Tippit family as well as the Kennedy family,
and he always took it personally when a police officer was killed. I mean, he
made it his business to contribute something financially when an officer was
killed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Who told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, they are up at the Liquor Commission in Oak Cliff—I don’t
think I know that just now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. That would be the Liquor Control Board—some of the personnel
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I believe that’s it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Do you know their names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I believe one was Johnny Cranks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. When was this told to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, they called me up there to inquire whether I was a member of
the corporation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And then they volunteered their opinion as to what his motivation
was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; that was what they thought and I talked to Jack a few times
at the county jail and he says he felt very sorry for the Kennedy family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Did Jack ever tell you why he shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; he never mentioned his name to me. He never mentioned his
name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. You were in the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. I know one of Jack’s brothers was in the intelligence?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I was in the Army intelligence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. You were in the Army intelligence—for how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, we were stationed at Langley Field in 1942 and 1943 and a
Captain Southern swore me in as an agent, to keep an eye on Communists and
Nazi saboteurs and to see whether anybody was leaving subversive literature
around for the boys to read, and if I did see anybody acting suspicious to write
a letter into a certain box number in Newport News, Va., which was about 20
miles away from Langley Field, and have a general theme, in fact, he says
he checked up on my family history and all of the members of the family, and
to write just like I am writing to my family, in fact he mentioned my brother
Jack and write a letter like you are writing, “Dear Brother Jack: Last night
we went to town and we had a few beers and we went to a movie and had a
few dances and Pvt. John Smith has been acting kind of queer lately,” and he
said somewhere in the letter mention that and they would take care of it from
then on, and I had to sign my name Johnny Newman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. What was the captain’s first name; do you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t recall his first name, but his name was Southern.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you spell it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. S-o-u-t-h-e-r-n [spelling].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. And he was part of what organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The Army Air Force—it was the Third Army Air Force based at
Langley Field, Va.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. But what was the specific organization in which he was in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, our outfit was called the Tenth Tow Target. They used to
tow targets and train pilots at the same time for these anti-aircraft guns, to fire
these guns behind the planes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Do you have anything else you want to bring out on any subject
or matter of any nature that you think either the Commission or Mr. Hubert
would be interested in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, all I know is that Jack had a very deep feeling about this
anti-Semitism in this country and, of course, with the massacre of the 6 million
Jews in Germany, and he had that on his mind quite a bit, and he was the most
religious of the boys in the family. The brothers went to say prayers for my dad
after he passed away for a full year, which is customary, of course, we went for
a few months—the other brothers, but Jack is the one that went for a full year,
and he observed going to the synagogue more regularly than the other brothers
did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Did he, in fact, go to the synagogue regularly, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, all I can say is that he went more regularly than the other
brothers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, he used to call from there or when he would be talking, he
would say he was going to the synagogue and he was coming from there, and in
the conversation he would say he talked to the rabbi and he would call and say
he was going there and we would invite him over for dinner or he would go
early in the morning and we would invite him over for a late breakfast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Do you think of anything else you want to develop or bring out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. All right, sir. Now, there has never been, Mr. Ruby, any interview
between you and me other than what took place in this room since this
deposition began, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. So that all that has ever passed between you and me has been
recorded in this room—right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>. Thank you very much. I’m glad to see you, Mr. Ruby, and I’m
glad you came down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Burleson</span>. Thank you, Mr. Ruby, and I will see you outside in just a
second.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="JACK_L_RUBY">TESTIMONY OF JACK L. RUBY</h2>
</div>

<p>The testimony of Jack L. Ruby was taken at 11 a.m., on July 18, 1964, at the
Dallas County Jail, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter, assistant counsel of
the President’s Commission. Present were: Bell P. Herndon and W. James
Wood, special agents of the FBI; Clayton Fowler and Joe H. Tonahill, counsel
for Jack Ruby; William F. Alexander, assistant district attorney for Dallas
County, Tex.; Allan L. Sweatt, chief criminal deputy for Dallas County, Tex.;
E. L. Holman, chief jailer; and Dr. William Robert Beavers, observer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that present at this time are Mr. Clayton
Fowler, chief counsel for Jack Ruby; Mr. Joe H. Tonahill, cocounsel for Jack
Ruby; Mr. William F. Alexander, assistant district attorney for Dallas County,
Tex.; Mr. Allan L. Sweatt, chief criminal deputy and polygraph operator for
Dallas County, Tex.; Mr. Bell P. Herndon, the polygraph operator and special
agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; Mr. W. James Wood, special
agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; Odell Oliver, court reporter;
and Arlen Specter, assistant counsel of the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>We have discussed preliminarily the procedure to be followed on the polygraph
examination, where those currently present may remain while
the polygraph operators, Mr. Herndon and Mr. Wood, explain the questions to
Mr. Ruby, and then everyone would leave except the operators, Messrs. Herndon
and Wood, the court reporter and I, and the question now subject to being
resolved is the issue of whether anyone will be present from the sheriff’s office.</p>

<p>As you know, the President’s Commission is trying to bring its work to a close
and the Chief Justice promised a polygraph test and that was 6 weeks ago
tomorrow. There have been a lot of things we have had to work out, and I
think it all ought to be on the record. I would want to give everyone an
opportunity to put any request right on the record in any way you want; and,
of course, I think that all your objections and comments about this proceeding
should go on the record. After you have so stated, I will state responsively
the Commission’s position on these proceedings.</p>

<p>I will say further that there is no closed mind on these issues and that they
will have to be weighed and evaluated by the members of the Commission
themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Let me first suggest then—why don’t I discuss this with Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That’s fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. And then Jack may say whether he wants to go ahead with this
and how I have advised him, and that he has on numerous occasions requested
it, and I will tell him that the Chief Justice promised to give it to him and they
are here ready to do it, which I am going to tell him, and if he insists on it,
I can’t and won’t try to hold him back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. That’s a good suggestion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Fine; and if he has changed his mind for any reason, I will
just want to have it on the record, and that will conclude the issue, so far as
the Commission is concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Let’s see—he’s on what floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. 6-M.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Let me step down and chat with him for just a few minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Do you want me to go with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. I may need you later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let the record show that Mr. Fowler left the room, and in
approximately 5 minutes thereafter, returned to the room from his conference
with Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. He says he’s going to take this test regardless of his lawyers,
and he says, “By God, I’m going to take the test.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Well, you know the law is in his favor and that he is presumed
to be sane, and there can’t be anybody speak for him but himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. I have advised him, and I have read this letter to him, and I
have explained all of this to him when I talked to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. If he wouldn’t take it now——<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Well, I won’t want to go back there then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. If he ever gets his hands on you, they’ll let him have it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span> (addressing the court reporter). I hope you have had a chance
to put these observations on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. I also want this further put into the record as to how many
requests, in addition to this one, that were made for this test.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We would be willing to accede to that request, and as you
know, we have been trying to set this up for a long while. The circumstances
of the Commission’s timetable require us to proceed today; that is, either proceed
or find out from Mr. Ruby that we would not ever proceed along this line.
I have requested Sheriff Decker to have a physician standing by so that he
may protect, to the fullest extent possible, Mr. Ruby’s physical condition if he
needs medical attention. As to your first request for Dr. Tanay of Detroit
to be present, the Commission would permit that. But since Dr. Tanay is not
now present, there is no way to implement that. We have no objection to
having any other doctor here who can be present here today.</p>

<p>With respect to request No. 2 made during our preliminary discussion, that
the results of the tests be held confidential, the Commission has heretofore on
other questions refused to make any advance commitment because of the nature
of its responsibility to make the final decision on disclosing or not disclosing
what it concludes is in the public interest. Or stated differently, the Commission
just won’t be committed. The results of this examination will not be
disclosed to anyone until the Commission itself has reviewed the results
and makes a decision, bearing many factors in mind, including your request, to
have the information remain confidential.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. All right; now in the past, of course we feel this—that as to
the other information that we assumed would be confidential and would not
be released to the press, this of course has been done, and we strenuously request
that this matter not be released to the press.</p>

<p>(At this point Sheriff Decker entered the room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Decker</span> (addressing Mr. Fowler). Jim Kerr caught you making a 50-yard
dash and they are circling around downstairs and Jim Kerr is just going
in circles wanting to know what Clayton Fowler is doing up in the jail.</p>

<p>(At this point Sheriff Decker left the room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Fowler, as to your last statement, I don’t know what you
are referring to specifically, and without taking it up in terms of specific
items, I couldn’t comment about it, and I don’t know that it would be really
useful to go into it at this time. The material given to the Commission,
where the Commission says it will be kept confidential, to the best of my knowledge,
has always been honored. There are in these proceedings many chains
and it is not possible in some cases to pinpoint responsibility, but the Chief
Justice and the Commission have honored every commitment they have made
heretofore. If they feel in their judgment—of course they have the paramount
responsibility for the entire investigation—that the results of this proceeding
ought to be kept secret, you may be assured that it will be implemented
to the fullest extent possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Well, of course, our request is that this matter be held strictly
confidential because it is being given at the request of the Commission and for
the benefit of the Commission, and we feel that the Commission and only the
Commission should have this information, and before any of it is released for
public consumption or private consumption, No. 1, the sheriff’s office, the district
attorney’s office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or any other agency
of the Government outside the Warren Commission—that we be told that this
is going to be done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That request, I think, can be honored in that you will be notified
in advance of any publication, that the Commission will make a publication if
in fact it ultimately decides to make such a publication. Now, there is one facet
of this matter which is difficult to control and that is the fact itself that a
polygraph examination is being administered. I do not know at this time what
circulation has been given to this fact, if any, by any of the people who are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>
involved, since it has touched many bases among many parties in this proceeding.
That fact itself may have already been disclosed, but with respect to the
results of this examination, I propose to keep those within the custody of the
Commission through the Federal Bureau of Investigation and its operators, who
are conducting this test, and their report will be made available only to the
Commission until the Commission decides whether it should be made public.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. All right. Now then, I would like for this record to also show
that this letter from Mr. Gordon Shanklin has been handed to you and that you
are fully appraised of what this letter contains, and I want the record to
further show that on this date (1:05 p.m.), not later than 10 minutes ago, I
talked with Jack Ruby. I read the letter to him. I explained it to him to the
best of my ability. I also advised him that the family legal advisor, Mr. Sol
Dann, an attorney of Detroit, had made these requests, and that following these
requests that I as Jack Ruby’s attorney advised him not to take the test, and
that if he did so he would be doing it against the advice of his attorney, against
the advice of his family advisor’s attorney, and against the advice of the family,
and that notwithstanding this, Jack said that he had requested this before
either Mr. Sol Dann or myself came into this case as attorneys, and that Chief
Justice Warren had promised that he would give him this test, and that regardless
of what Mr. Dann’s wishes would be, together with his entire family
and together with his attorneys of record, that he insisted on this test, but that
a further proceeding of it would be against the advice of his lawyers, and at
this time we do respectfully request that the Commission not disclose any of the
questions that will be submitted to Jack Ruby to any other person other than
the operators, the investigator for the Warren Commission, and his attorneys
present, Mr. Joe Tonahill and Clayton Fowler; and that more specifically that
these questions not be given to anyone connected with the Dallas Sheriff’s Office,
the Dallas Agency of the Bureau of Investigation, the Dallas District Attorney’s
Office, and more specifically, Mr. Bill Alexander, who is present in the room at
this time and representing the district attorney’s office, and Mr. Allan Sweatt,
who is present in the room and representing the Dallas Sheriff’s Office. Anything
else, Joe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. I might go back on a little background whenever you finish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. I wish you would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. With respect to the notation for the record concerning the contents
of the letter from Mr. Gordon Shanklin, special agent in charge of the
FBI office here in Dallas, that identical information has been conveyed through
the Federal Bureau of Investigation to Mr. J. Lee Rankin, general counsel of
the Commission. Having considered those requests and those factors, the general
counsel has instructed me to proceed to have this polygraph taken today
if Mr. Jack Ruby wants to have this polygraph taken in accordance with his
prior request to the Commission on June 7, 1964, and the commitment given by
the Commission through the Chief Justice that such a polygraph examination
would be given. With respect to the request that none of the questions be made
available to anybody from the Dallas Police Department or the Dallas District
Attorney’s Office or the Dallas Sheriff’s Office, the Commission’s position on that
is that if the questions are to be submitted in advance to the counsel for the
defendant, that there is equal standing on the part of the State to have similar
treatment.</p>

<p>Previously, I outlined for you the procedure that we proposed to adopt during
the course of this polygraph examination, to wit; having the people present in
the room who are here at the present time, which includes Mr. Clayton Fowler
and Mr. Joe Tonahill, representing Mr. Ruby; Mr. William F. Alexander, representing
the Dallas District Attorney’s office; Mr. Allan L. Sweatt, chief criminal
deputy of the Dallas Sheriff’s office; Mr. Bell P. Herndon, special agent of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Mr. W. James Wood, special agent of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, who are going to administer the polygraph
examination.</p>

<p>The questions to be asked of Mr. Ruby at the time of administration of the
examination would be set forth to Mr. Ruby so that he would understand them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span>
fully; and with the other people present, it would be known what questions were
going to be asked of Mr. Ruby in advance of the actual asking.</p>

<p>Then, it was the Commission’s view that everybody should leave the room
except for the two special agents of the FBI who would be administering the
test, the court reporter and me, so that the minimum number of people would
be present.</p>

<p>I have conveyed that request to Sheriff Decker and he has insisted that a
member of his staff be present as custodian of the body of Jack Ruby, since he has
that responsibility. It is not yet determined who that will be, but the Commission
proposes to proceed on the administration of the polygraph test under
those circumstances, with the only open question being the identity, if anyone,
of the representative of the sheriff who has charge of the custody of the body
of the defendant here or Jack Ruby, since he is not a defendant in this proceeding,
actually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. I should like to say as one of Jack Ruby’s defense counsel
along with Chief Defense Counsel Clayton Fowler, that when I entered the
defense of Jack Ruby back in December of 1963, with Mr. Belli, at that time
we insisted before undertaking his defense that he agree to a polygraph test
and truth serum test or any other scientific test that would reflect whether or
not there was a connection between him and Lee Harvey Oswald or in any
respect a conspiracy. He agreed and insisted at that time that there was no
such conspiracy. He did not know Lee Harvey Oswald and there was no connection
between them and that he would undertake any type of a scientific
test that we could have made available for him. Jack Ruby has insisted on
those tests ever since.</p>

<p>We have from time to time proposed to the FBI through Mr. Gordon Shanklin
and others, that a lie detector test be given Mr. Ruby. We have filed motions
to obtain scientific tests. Mr. Ruby has insisted on these tests very strenuously
and has felt that I have stood in the way of him obtaining them.</p>

<p>I was present during the Warren Commission deposition of Jack Ruby along
with Mr. Jim Bowie of the district attorney’s office some 6 weeks ago when
Chief Justice Earl Warren on numerous occasions responded to Jack Ruby
that he had it in his power to make available to him some day in the future a
polygraph test and would do so at Mr. Ruby’s request.</p>

<p>Now it has come down that Chief Justice Earl Warren and the Warren
Commission are now in the process of keeping faith with their promise to Mr.
Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. Fowler and I have talked with the various psychiatrists, Drs. Tanay,
West, and Beavers, each of whom feels that because Jack Ruby is of unsound
mind and mentally ill, this polygraph test is a mistake and would produce
nothing by way of an accurate result of deception, truth, or conclusiveness in
any regard and feel that it should not be made.</p>

<p>As cocounsel with Mr. Fowler. I yield to his position here and concur with
him, but as a personal individual, very close and very knowledgeable of the
entire history of this polygraph demand on the part of Ruby, it is my personal
view that even though he is of unsound mind, does not know right from wrong,
is mentally ill, and his psychiatrists are opposed to it, unless he is given the
polygraph test there will never be any satisfaction in any respect. His condition
might even grow worse without it, and in the interest of satisfying everyone
concerned, the State, the Nation, and the world—that in all probability
if this polygraph test is not given, there will be left hanging in the clouds certain
doubts as to whether there was a conspiracy between Ruby and others or
Oswald, or whether they knew each other, despite the fact that his mental
condition may be such that it will not demonstrate any effective results.</p>

<p>Nevertheless my personal view is that it might be well to go forward with
it, and certainly if all appellate efforts are exhausted on behalf of Jack Ruby
and his case is affirmed all the way up, which I feel that it won’t be; if his
family and Jack Ruby should refuse to undergo a polygraph test, certainly the
Board of Pardons and Parole may look with disfavor upon that fact and infer possible
premeditation on his part in the shooting of Oswald or a possible conspiracy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span>
and might rule against him in granting clemency, in the event it ever
reached that stage. And, irrespective of whether an effective polygraph test can
be run of this man at this time in his present mental state or not, I personally
feel that an effort should be made to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. For the record I want to add that requests have been received
by the Commission, requests made on behalf of Mr. Ruby, to have a polygraph
test, prior to the time the Commission heard his testimony on June 7 of this
year, and that the Commission has not initiated any effort whatsoever to have a
polygraph test taken but is only conducting these proceedings today to make
available to Mr. Ruby this examination if he wishes to have it at this time, in
accordance with the promise made by the Commission through the Chief Justice
on June 7.</p>

<p>I want to be emphatic and clear on this question that we do not now and
have never asked for or insisted on a polygraph examination. If Mr. Ruby
does not want to have such an examination taken, that is acceptable to the
President’s Commission on the Assassination. As we discussed informally
before we started a record proceeding, in this event we are willing to have anything
put on the record that Mr. Fowler or Mr. Tonahill wish to place on the
record as his attorneys; and of course, we do not wish to, have not, and will not
interfere in any way with your representation of Mr. Ruby, as his counsel, so
that he may take your advice and proceed in accordance with your advice.</p>

<p>If you wish to put on the record any medical evidence, I am authorized to
have that done here today or at a later date. Mr. Tonahill and I discussed this
matter by telephone last Wednesday and I indicated to him at that time that
the Commission was willing to have such evidence placed on the record as an
aid to their evaluation of whether to place any credence in the tests which are
going to be administered.</p>

<p>It has been somewhat uncertain as to whether this proceeding would go forward
today, so that counsel for Mr. Ruby may wish to provide supplemental
data by way of testimony, letter, affidavit or in whatever form you choose.
The Commission will be glad to receive it and to weigh it in evaluating whatever
these tests may disclose.</p>

<p>May the record further show that arrangements have been made to have Dr.
Norman Beavers available, adjacent to the room where these proceedings will
take place, in the event that there is any medical attention required for Mr.
Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Sheriff Decker gave me this phone number and said he would
be standing by.</p>

<p>I would like to add to Mr. Specter’s comments that it is correct that numerous
letters have been written by me to the Warren Commission requesting the
polygraph test prior to the intervention of the psychiatrist, who felt that it would
be a mistake.</p>

<p>At no time has the Warren Commission agreed and stated that they desired
the polygraph test. The test, as I understand, has grown out of the agreement
between Mr. Ruby and Mr. Chief Justice Earl Warren at the hearing that
occurred here about 6 weeks ago.</p>

<p>I should like to say that I asked Sheriff Bill Decker to get in touch with Dr.
William Beavers, and this was as a result of the conversation with Mr. Specter,
and have Dr. William Beavers available so that he could be interrogated subsequent
to the running of the polygraph test. Is that agreeable?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; that is agreeable, if you desire to do just that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Further, let’s add this, Joe, that in whatever capacity or degree
it would help to substantiate that in our opinion we believe that Jack Ruby is
of unsound mind.</p>

<p>We would like to submit at a later date a report by Dr. Emanuel Tanay, a
practicing psychiatrist in Detroit, Mich., a report by him based upon the examination
of Jack Ruby, together with the report of Dr. West, and we would
respectfully request that this matter be furnished to you at a later date. We
have it available but not for today, and we would like to make it a part of this
record, as suggested by counsel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Fowler, the Commission will be glad to receive any evidence
that you may wish to submit on all the questions which you have raised during
the course of this proceeding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Whoever is in charge of his body ought not to be an expert on
this thing [referring and indicating the polygraph machine].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. You and I have done all we can do on it. I am not going to
physically manhandle Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. No; Jack Ruby is going to insist on doing it, and until he is
declared a ward through an insanity proceedings, he is presumed to be able to
exercise his own consent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let us discuss this off the record a moment.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Mr. Specter and Messrs. Tonahill and Fowler off the
record regarding presence in the room of anyone able to operate a polygraph
machine other than the FBI operator, Mr. Herndon.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Let us put this into the record, that we would further object to
anyone in the sheriff’s office being present. If the only valid reason is one of
security, and I would like the record to reflect that we are within the confines
of the Dallas County Jail, namely, on 7-M, which is a part of the Dallas
County Jail, and that it would appear to me to be virtually escape proof, and as
I understand previously when Mr. Warren was here, that he was allowed to talk
with Jack Ruby by himself and without the presence of anyone from the sheriff’s
department, which further leads me to believe that this is not for security purposes
only, and we will object to the presence of anyone from the Dallas County
Sheriff’s office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In response to your objection. Mr. Fowler, for the record I
will state that the Commission has requested that its preference be honored
to have no one other than the FBI personnel administering the test, the court
reporter, and me present, but that Sheriff Decker has taken the position that
the prisoner, Jack Ruby, is his responsibility and that he must have someone
on his staff present. Sheriff Decker did agree to substitute as that person the
chief jailer, who has no knowledge of or experience with polygraph operation,
so that the confidentiality of these proceedings is secure in my view.</p>

<p>Sheriff Decker’s position is not that Mr. Ruby may escape, but there may be
an incident which would require having someone present, and the sheriff feels
that someone from his staff ought to be present. In view of his position
on that, it is my conclusion that such a proviso is justifiable under all the
circumstances.</p>

<p>With respect to the conversations between the Chief Justice and Mr. Ruby, I
was present at the time those conversations were held and they were held
in the corner of the room in which we are now sitting, following the formal
testimony of Mr. Ruby at a time when there were numerous people in another
portion of this room in which we now sit, so that at no time was the Chief
Justice alone with Mr. Ruby in any separate room. Mr. Tonahill was present
at that time and I think can confirm my version.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. We were all present and the sheriff’s department men did
leave, the personnel there—the sheriff and his deputies. He left him in the
custody—we left Ruby’s body in charge of a Secret Service man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Elmer Moore.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And at that time there were also present Mr. Tonahill, Mr.
Rankin, Congressman Ford, Mr. Ball of the Commission’s staff, and I was present.
At no time did the Chief Justice have any conversations privately with Mr.
Ruby except that, at the very end, Mr. Ruby, the Chief Justice, and I were in
a corner of the room conversing, and there were many others present at that
time, and I think Mr. Tonahill can verify that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. I was present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, for the record, I want to state that Mr. Fowler has previously
gone to discuss the matter with Mr. Ruby to determine what are Mr.
Ruby’s desires in terms of having a polygraph examination, in view of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span>
stated position of the Commission that it does not request such an examination,
but has made such an examination available to Mr. Ruby if he wants one,
pursuant to his request to have such an examination, made during the course
of Commission proceedings on June 7, 1964, and the response by Chief Justice
Warren that the Commission would offer him such a polygraph examination in
response to his repeated requests.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Now, I would like to answer regarding the presence of a deputy
sheriff here. I believe you advanced the theory that it was thought by Mr.
Decker that there might be something that might occur during the giving of
the polygraph tests that perhaps might disrupt things.</p>

<p>We further feel and respectfully request that if there is this feeling by the
polygraph operator himself, that he will be conducting this test some 10 or
12 feet from a door, and if the sheriff is allowed at all, that he be allowed
to stand at the door and any other exit that might be in the building, to not be
able to view the chart or any part of it. This would be our request to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The conditions set forth in your request will be granted and the
sheriff’s custodian will be present at the door so that he may not have access
to the chart, to insure the confidential nature of these proceedings.</p>

<p>I think we are now ready to have Mr. Ruby come in, but before he comes
in, let’s take a 5-minute recess.</p>

<p>Let the record show we are taking a 5-minute recess.</p>

<p>(Proceedings recessed and resumed as stated.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. I assume that once Jack is brought in, there will be complete
silence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes. Mr. Alexander, do you want to make your request for the
record?</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Yes; please. At this time for and on behalf of the Dallas
County, Tex., district attorney’s office, a request is made that the Warren
Commission furnish the district attorney’s office a list of the questions asked
Jack Ruby in this polygraph examination, and that a copy of the recording
made by the polygraph machine be furnished the Dallas County district attorney’s
office. We would also like a copy of the interpretation of the test,
but whether or not we are given an interpretation of the test, we do want
the aforementioned questions and actual tape of the polygraph machine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Fowler, you may want to make a similar request as to
the results.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. In behalf of Jack Ruby and as attorney for Jack Ruby, I
respectfully request that the Warren Commission deny the request of the Dallas
district attorney’s office for the following reasons: Number One—that this is
a matter of request that has been made by Mr. Ruby to the Warren Commission
only, that if the district attorney’s office were furnished with these questions
and answers and any other matters pertaining to the giving of this polygraph
test, it might and could and very well effect the outcome of his case that is
now on appeal before the court of criminal appeals here in the State of Texas,
and we respectfully request that the request by the district attorney’s office be
denied by the Warren Commission in all of their requests for this information.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we who represent Jack Ruby, respectfully request that we
be furnished a copy of the questions that will be asked and that if some determination
is made as to the answers and the outcome is ever made public, that
we be furnished the information of the outcome of the tests.</p>

<p>Now, this is off the record.</p>

<p>(Statement by Mr. Fowler to Mr. Specter, off the record, requesting that
Mr. Ruby be advised again when brought into the room for the test, the requests
of his attorneys and family with respect to taking the test.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In response to those two statements, no commitment can be
made on behalf of the Commission anticipating the action of the Commission
in advance of knowledge by the Commission of the results of the tests, and any
additional evidence which may be submitted on the competency of Mr. Ruby
which may aid the Commission in the evaluation of the results of the polygraph
examination. The requests of Mr. Alexander and Mr. Fowler will be transmitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span>
to the Commission and will be carefully studied by the Commission before any
final decision is reached.</p>

<p>With respect to a list of questions, the procedure as previously outlined will
permit all parties to be present when the questions are enumerated, so that the
questions asked of Mr. Ruby will be a surprise to no one, but will be discussed
in his presence and in the presence of representatives of both the district attorney’s
office and Mr. Ruby’s defense counsel, so that there is no limitation to
the taking of notes on the questions that may be asked.</p>

<p>With respect to the results, including a copy of the results themselves and
a copy of the interpretation, no commitment can be made until the Commission
has examined the results in this matter fully.</p>

<p>With respect to affecting the outcome of any subsequent proceedings, the
Commission has exercised the greatest possible care in avoiding the influencing
of the State court proceedings.</p>

<p>The action taken by the Commission has been designed to fulfill its function,
while at the same time not interfering, or interfering to the minimal possible
extent, with the State court proceedings. Now, before we get Mr. Ruby in,
do you want to make a request for his doctor; and when we get Mr. Ruby in,
we will make the other statement and then we will be able to go ahead, but
I don’t think we want to go through any more with him present than we have to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Yes; it is requested that Dr. William Beavers, who has been
retained by Jack Ruby’s family to observe and treat Jack Ruby, be present
during the examination in order that he may observe and render any expression
that he may have to offer that will be of benefit to the Commission as well
as to Jack Ruby’s mental health condition, with special reference to interpreting
the results of the polygraph tests, and as an aid and guide to the Commission
in its interpretation of it as to what weight and value to give to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Does that request, Mr. Tonahill, go only for the time that everyone
is present, or do you want him present, while the examination itself is
going on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. While the examination itself is going on—before and during
the examinations—before the examination and during the actual examination,
so that he can actually observe the actual examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In view of the expression of concern that has been made by
Dr. Tanay, that request will be granted, since it is made by counsel for Mr.
Ruby at this time.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Jailer</span> (on entering the room). He will be right up.</p>

<p>(Mr. Ruby entered the hearing room at 2:23 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record now show that Mr. Ruby is present. Mr. Ruby,
I am Arlen Specter. How are you today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Fine; how are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Jack, that’s Mr. Specter of the Warren Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Ruby, why don’t you have a chair over here—we’ve been
getting things set up, and let me introduce you to everybody so you will know
who everybody is.</p>

<p>This is Miss Odell Oliver, who is the court reporter, and she will take your
testimony just like we did before.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Oliver</span>. How do you do, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And I guess you know Dr. Beavers, and this is Mr. Wood. He
is one of the polygraph operators with the FBI, and this is Mr. Herndon, one of
the operators and with the FBI also. This is Mr. Alexander, and your name, sir?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Jailer</span>. Mr. Holman, E. L.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. This is Mr. Holman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Can Fowler remain here after I start with the interrogation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; Mr. Ruby. The procedure which we’ve discussed is this and
this is subject to agreement of all sides, and we’ve been through it, but let me
go through it with you. We are going to conduct the polygraph examination in
a standard way, which involves a series of questions, about eight or nine in
duration. Before we start with the series, the questions will be explained to you
in advance so that you will know exactly what the questions are to be and you
will know what the operator means by the questions. He will explain them so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span>
that there is no possibility of any confusion in terms of what the questions
mean so they won’t surprise you. You will have full awareness of what is going
to be asked.</p>

<p>At that time, everybody who is present in this room will be present when the
questions are discussed in a general way. So that the record may be complete,
let it show that Mr. Fowler is here and Mr. Tonahill is here, and Mr. Alexander
is here, and Mr. Herndon and Mr. Wood are here. Dr. Beavers is here, and Chief
Jailer E. L. Holman is here, Odell Oliver is here, and of course, I am here.
Those are the only people who are here now and they are the only people who
will be present when we explain each series of questions to you, so that you
understand what is happening and what questions are going to be asked.</p>

<p>Now, scientifically, it’s preferable to have as few people possible at the time
the examination is administered as we can, so for that purpose, we are trying to
cut down the number as much as we can. We had originally thought that the
only people present would be the two operators, the court reporter and I.
Now we have Mr. Holman here on the custody question, and then your counsel
requested especially that Dr. Beavers be present at the time of the administration
of the tests. It is our desire to have only those people present, which
would mean Mr. Alexander wouldn’t be here and Mr. Tonahill wouldn’t be here
and Mr. Fowler wouldn’t be here at the time the test is administered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I would like to have Mr. Fowler here in preference of Dr. Beavers.
May I request that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; you may request that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. And how soon will the answers be released, as soon as possible?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, the answers are going to be compiled by the FBI and then
they’re going to go to the Commission, to Chief Justice Warren of the Commission,
and I am not in a position to say to you when the answers will be released.
That will be up to the Commission. They will have to study the results of the
tests and make a decision on the time of release of the tests. Everything is up
to them as to whether they will be released, what the release will be, and when
it will be made.</p>

<p>I want to say preliminarily before we start, that the Commission has not
requested the test, but it is responding to the request which was made on your
behalf by letter, before the Chief Justice questioned you on June 7.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You requested then that a test be given.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We want it to be perfectly plain for the record that the Commission
isn’t pushing this matter, but it’s only in response to your request, and
that you have learned counsel here who are representing you, and you are
aware of that. We want to make it pointed and clear that anything you say
could be used against you, and it is possible for adverse or unfavorable inferences
to be drawn. Whenever a defendant who is involved in a criminal proceeding
says anything, anything he says could be held against him.</p>

<p>I know Mr. Fowler and Mr. Tonahill have advised you of that and that has
been brought to your attention, but this record should show that we called it to
your attention as forcefully and as clearly as we could, so that you would
understand what we are doing here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Mr. Specter; let me explain one thing. Under Texas law,
nothing that Jack says here could be used against him in Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Bill, I’m not quarreling with that, and I know you certainly are
not going to help me, I know that, but I want to get a copy to the chief as soon
as I can, Chief Holman over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You would like to do what, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. To have the report as soon as the results are analyzed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That, as I say, is up to the Commission, but you understand what
I have said to you here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And under those circumstances do you continue to request that
such an examination be given you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes: any questions you want to ask, anything pertaining to this—I
will answer anything without reluctance. There’s no punches to be pulled.
I want to answer anything and everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Fowler, I think, wants to make a statement for the record
too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In fact, Bill, you can stay here If you want to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Jack: let me ask you this: A little while ago I came up into
the jail cell and talked with you, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. And at that time I advised you that the Warren Commission
people were here at your request to give you a polygraph test?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. I also showed you a letter from Mr. Gordon Shanklin of the
FBI here in Dallas, that he had received requests that were submitted to him
by Mr. Sol Dann, who is the legal advisor to your family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. And that certain requests were made there, No. 1, that the tests
would be given in the presence of Dr. Tanay, with no outsiders present, with
particular reference to anyone from the district attorney’s office or the sheriff’s
office, and further, that it would have to be assured that the results of the tests
would be held confidential by the Commission, and that under no circumstances
made available to the district attorney or the press. Further, that written
authority for such examination be obtained from Mr. Earl Ruby. Now, I have
explained this to you, have I not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; can I change that now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Well, let me go on further, Jack, and as your attorney of record,
at that time I advised that you not take nor submit to this polygraph test.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. And at this time, as your attorney of record, I advise you in the
presence of these gentlemen and Commission, these people representing the
Commission, that you will be doing so against the advice of your counsel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. And against the advice and wishes of your family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Now, do you still at this time wish to take the tests?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; and I would also like to add that, if I have a right to say
this—I want it be made immediately that the district attorney’s office should
receive whatever is necessary in regard to the answers to the district attorney,
and as I once wrote to District Attorney Henry Wade, that I didn’t want to
publicize it, but if possible they may—I would prefer that naturally, but at that
time it was so easy to get a lie detector test, I wrote to Henry Wade; that it is
not for publicity purposes but only for authenticity and the truth. So, I agree
with everything except that if I may supersede the attorney and say I’m not
concerned about withholding anything. I want it to be released immediately
to all parties concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, your request on that, Mr. Ruby, will be transmitted to
the Commission and they will consider that very carefully in reaching whatever
conclusion they do about releasing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I want to supersede the attorney, Mr. Dann, in stating that I want
everything to come out immediately, as soon as possible, and whoever wants
to know the results—what the results are—I want it to be known, regardless of
which way it turns.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Ruby, you want Mr. Fowler to remain with you during the
course of the examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In view of Mr. Ruby’s request, it is my view that it ought to be
honored and that the group is of such a size now that it ought to remain as it
is constituted at the present time for both sessions.</p>

<p>We have done our best to limit it, but since it is a legitimate request here to
include Mr. Fowler, we will sit in this group during all portions of the test.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span>
Mr. Ruby has indicated that he has no objection to having Mr. Alexander
here, and if one side is here, the other may be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Mr. Specter, if it will help the ultimate in the tests, I have
no objection to leaving the room, and perhaps Mr. Tonahill, I think, could very
well leave, or if Jack has no objections and perhaps wants us here, we will stay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I am advised by Mr. Herndon that the technical considerations
are not persuasive as to one or two more people, with this many present, so
that if it’s acceptable to all parties, specifically Mr. Ruby, we will just proceed
with the group that’s presently here during all portions, the explanatory portion
to Mr. Ruby and the actual testing itself.</p>

<p>Is that agreeable, gentlemen? Is that agreeable with you, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. <span class="locked">Well——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Jack, let me make this request. I don’t think Bill can read a
polygraph test, but I would feel better as your attorney if Mr. Alexander were
not present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t mind everyone remaining here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Well, of course, again—let me advise you that if Mr. Alexander
remains—let me advise you of your rights—that if Mr. Alexander remains,
he is a member of the district attorney’s staff, the answers to these
questions could be used against you at some later date, if they are adverse to
your rights, and as your attorney, I advise you that it would be my suggestion
to you and request to you that Mr. Alexander not be allowed to remain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span> (addressing Mr. Alexander). Will you object?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Not at all, Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. If Mr. Alexander is willing to abide by your request, Mr. Ruby,
then your request will govern as far as the proceeding is concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Now, Mr. Alexander and I—when it comes to me representing
you or any other client—I represent one client and he represents the other.
He, in my opinion, is a perfect gentleman, but in the courtroom he is a perfect
prosecutor, and I like to be as near a perfect defense lawyer as I can, and I
believe that by allowing him to stay <span class="locked">here——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, <span class="locked">Fowler——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Well, I’m thinking of you now. I’m asking you to do this, and
again, this is entirely up to you, so it’s your decision. I think I have fully
explained to you the reason why we would not want him here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Now, I’ve got the monkey on my back now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Well, you’ve got more than a monkey on your back, Jack. This
is your decision.</p>

<p>(Conference between Mr. Fowler and Mr. Ruby out of the hearing of this
reporter and others in the room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, whatever my attorney suggests, I guess I will have to follow
through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Your request then is that Mr. Alexander not be present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. That will be fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. If it is all right with you, we will proceed on that basis, but of
course, that will go only for the time the test is actually being administered
to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Bell Herndon will now start to explain the proceedings to
you. He is the operator of the polygraph, the principal operator here, Mr.
Ruby. As I explained to you, Mr. Herndon and Mr. Wood, are joint operators
for the FBI on the polygraph or lie detector test and Mr. Herndon will take
over now to explain just how it’s going to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Thank you. Mr. Ruby, first of all, I want to show you my
credentials so you will know that I am a special agent and I am from the FBI
laboratory in Washington, D.C. (Exhibited instruments to Mr. Ruby.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">515</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Perhaps to set the record straight, Mr. Specter, I might mention
that my colleague, Special Agent Wood, is not actually a polygraph examiner,
but he is here to assist me in this examination. Is that all right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, that’s fine to specify that exact status.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. He is here to assist me and to help me in the interrogation of
this gentleman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Herndon, before you start on the questioning, we will want
to put Mr. Ruby under oath, so pause at that point, but proceed now to
explain what is going to happen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Mr. Ruby, actually prior to any polygraph examination which
the Federal Bureau of Investigation gives to anyone, we have a consent form
that I want to read to you, and as I want to remind you, of course, you have
been advised of your rights, and there is no sense of my going over it again,
but I want to remind you that your counsel and your attorneys are here.</p>

<p>I will now read to you this consent form that we use as a standard procedure
on this type of examination.</p>

<p>“Consent to Interview with Polygraph. I, Jack L. Ruby”—I believe that’s
the way you sign your name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “I, Jack L. Ruby, consent freely and voluntarily to be interviewed
by special agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which I also
know as the FBI, in connection with the President’s Commission on the Assassination
of President Kennedy investigation. I agree to the use of the polygraph
or so-called lie detector during this interview or any part of it, and I am willing
to be present at the time and place of interview for such time as is necessary
to complete the interview.</p>

<p>“No threats or promises of any kind have been made to me to obtain my
consent to this interview.”</p>

<p>Now, I can let you read that if you would like or your attorney might like to
read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s perfectly all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. If it’s agreeable with you, I would appreciate it if you would
sign it, Mr. Ruby, if that’s agreeable with your counsel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. And Mr. Wood and I will witness that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Do you want it “Jack Ruby” or “Jack L. Ruby”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You sign it as you usually sign, but do you want to read it
any further, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I’ll just sign it.</p>

<p>(Mr. Ruby at this time signed the instrument referred to, which was thereafter
signed by witnesses Special Agents Herndon and Wood.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Did you get your pants sewed up, Joe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. It went through to my leg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That was a pretty rough brawl we had, wasn’t it, Joe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Joe, I’d appreciate it if you weren’t in the room. Can I ask you
to leave, Joe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. I’ll be glad to leave, if you want me to, Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. As a matter of fact, I prefer Bill Alexander to you, you’re supposed
to be my friend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Let the record show that Mr. Ruby says he prefers Bill
Alexander being here during this investigation, who is the assistant district
attorney who asked that a jury give him the death sentence, to myself, who
asked the jury to acquit him, his attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. May we proceed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Please do, Mr. Herndon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Mr. Ruby, as you know, we have a doctor here, and before
we begin anything, I want you to try to relax. I realize that there is some
tension here, and before we proceed any further, I want to ask you very
generally, how do you feel today, right now, specifically speaking?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Very good, except—may I be very honest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. What is the preference of the doctor being here? Is he supposed
to be my doctor, I mean Dr. Beavers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Mr. Specter, do you want to answer that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; Mr. Ruby, he is here at the request of Mr. Tonahill, and I
believe concurred in, by your chief counsel, Mr. Fowler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The reason I asked you about your health, Mr. Ruby, obviously
I don’t want to proceed with this interrogation of the polygraph type when
you obviously may not feel well physically today. I wouldn’t want to subject
you to the examination unless you felt well enough to take it, and I will ask
you some very general questions about your health in regard to your history
in that regard.</p>

<p>Have you every had any respiratory diseases or illnesses such as asthma or
trouble with breathing, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. None whatever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Any sinus condition or trouble?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Have you ever had any heart ailments?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. No heart trouble to your knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. [No response.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Mr. Ruby, have you had any medication of any type whatsoever
today, such as tranquilizers, aspirin, any drugs at all today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. While you’ve been here in custody, have you been under any
medication?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. None whatever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Herndon, at this time I shall administer the oath to Mr.
Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You want me to stand up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, sir; if you would please. As assistant counsel, I have the
authority under the law to administer an oath to you for proceedings in the
nature of depositions.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the answers and information you shall give in
this proceeding before the President’s Commission on the Assassination of President
Kennedy will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have the answers you have heretofore given in response to the
informal questions already asked of you been the truth, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Repeat that again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have the answers which you have already given in response to
the informal questions put to you by Mr. Herndon and others here, are they all
true?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, about my health—are all true—yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right, Mr. Herndon, will you proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes. Thank you.</p>

<p>I understand, Mr. Ruby, that you have had your lunch today, is that correct?
I want to make sure you have had a chance to eat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. When did you eat, how long ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I would guess approximately 12:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You’ve had no digestive problems while you’ve been here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Have you had any coffee today—these are questions that will
help us later on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. One early in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Early in the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Did you have more than one cup?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">517</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. One and a half cups.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That’s your usual amount of coffee you have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Did you have any coffee at lunch, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Now, Mr. Ruby, have you ever had <span class="locked">a——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The reason why I say this, there was some newspaper items recently
that brought up the fact that I was of unsound mind. Do I sound that
way to you at the present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I don’t feel that I am qualified at this time to make any statement
in that regard. I’m sure you would understand that that is something
you can’t give in a moment’s notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Would you care to sit over here, Mr. Ruby, and I will further
explain the test to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Surely.</p>

<p>(At this time Mr. Ruby conferred with Mr. Fowler out of the hearing of this
reporter and others in the room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right.</p>

<p>(At this time Mr. Ruby seated himself in the polygraph test chair.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. This is a polygraph chair. The reason it is so constructed, we
want to take advantage of these high arms [indicating arms on the polygraph
chair] so that we can get a better tracing, and very frankly, Mr. Ruby, I want
to give you as best an examination as I can. So, it’s going to take a little
time and I want you to relax as best you can. I realize you might be a little
nervous, and I will certainly take that into consideration. Let me just briefly,
Mr. Ruby, tell you about the polygraph examination and what we’re going to
do today. I want to proceed by hooking up some of these pieces of equipment
and briefly tell you what it is. Now, may I ask you to remove the material
you have in your pocket, sir, and you might want to give it to your counsel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let the record show that Mr. Ruby has removed all the objects
from his upper left-hand pocket.</p>

<p>(After removing objects mentioned, Mr. Ruby handed the same to Mr.
Fowler.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I gather from looking at your overalls that you don’t have any
restrictive garments or belts or anything underneath on you which would hinder
you or your relaxation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You are very comfortable?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Very fine, Mr. Ruby. Now, Mr. Ruby, there are two ways I
can do this. I can do two things—I can either go ahead and put this equipment
on you right now and describe briefly how it’s going to work, or if you want,
I can go over these first series of questions and give you some instructions, and
then put the equipment on. Which do you prefer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Which is the most effective way to get what you want?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Well, I think in view of the fact that we will have some discussion
here, I want to make sure that you perfectly understand these questions,
I will go ahead and give you some basic instructions about how these questions
are going to be asked and how I want you to answer them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. And then later on, as I hook you up, I will briefly describe what
this equipment is going to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The polygraph examination will entail, as Mr. Specter indicated,
just approximately 8 to 9 questions, Mr. Ruby, in what we call a series.
Now, I’m going to go over these questions with you right now very carefully.
I want to make sure that the way I have them phrased is in such a way that you
understand perfectly what I mean by them. We will discuss the question and
you may if you want to, even answer the question at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I would appreciate it myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. In other words, I’m going to tell you what the question is going
to be and you shall feel free to answer it “Yes” or “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Excuse me, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. At this time, Jack, I request that in view of the fact that you’re
not hooked up, that you do not answer the question and reserve those until
such time as you will be on the machine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Then, we will just discuss the questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Do it to your advantage, may I add.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I generally prefer in my practice with the polygraph to have
the gentleman answer the question so that he knows he has already answered it,
and as a matter of record, he knows that that question is coming along.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Please let me do it, will you? [Addressing Mr. Fowler.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span> (no response).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I will bow to whatever Mr. Specter or counsel wants to do in
this regard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Fowler, I hate to dispute with you, but let me do it this way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Well, Jack, again, Mr. Alexander is here and again I tell you
this—that the answers to some of these questions could be absolutely very
detrimental to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. They can’t be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. I’m talking about from a legal standpoint. Now, morally, I
know how you feel and you want to do the best you can for the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. But by the same token, this gentleman over here [referring to
Mr. Alexander] represents the State, who at this time is not representing you.
Now, if we could allow Mr. Alexander to have the benefit of the nature of the
questions, with the exception of the answers—if this is what Jack wants—but
I do not want Mr. Alexander to have the benefit of the answers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The test may be conducted either way. As Mr. Herndon has
explained, he has a slight preference to have the answers, but the ultimate decision
on that is up to Mr. Ruby and his counsel. The Commission will proceed
in either manner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It’s unfortunate that my attorney, Mr. Fowler, don’t see as I do.
I would like to give every cooperation without the slightest fraction of interference.
That’s why I requested that. You won’t let me do it that way, huh,
Fowler?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. I’m requesting that you do not, Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. It will be no problem.</p>

<p>(Addressing the court reporter.) Do you have any problem hearing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Court Reporter.</span> If Mr. Ruby would talk just a little bit louder it would be
fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Mr. Ruby, I have placed all these questions in a form so that
they are very short and concise and can be answered only by “Yes” or “No,”
and that’s the way we have to ask a question during a polygraph examination, but
I’ll go over them with you and give you an idea of what they’re going to be.
During the normal series, I’m going to ask several questions, of course, which
are pertinent to the Commission’s investigation, but I will also ask you several
questions which more or less just deal with your identity, your background and
your name, so you will have two types of questions that I will ask. Now, the
first question I’m going to ask you under series 1, which is rather pertinent, and
I want you to know that I’m going to ask it, and I’m going to phrase it as simply
as I can.</p>

<p>“Did you know Oswald before November 22, 1963?”</p>

<p>Now, what I mean by “know” is did you have any personal acquaintance of
this individual, any personal acquaintance? Have you ever seen him, did you
have any conversation with him? In other words, as you would say, “Well, I
know that person.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Should I answer that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">519</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Not now, Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That question will be asked or repeated, and so you and I will
understand what we want, I’ll repeat it. “Did you know Oswald before November
22, 1963?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Another question that I will ask in series 1, after I get the
instrument adjusted, and it will be short and simple and answerable only by
“Yes” or “No.”</p>

<p>“Did you assist Oswald in the assassination?”</p>

<p>Do you understand that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; it is very clear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I tried to make them as short as possible and as clear as possible.
Again, I’m going to ask you just as a matter of format here, “Did you take
any medication this morning?” You have already answered that question, but
that will be one of the questions I will ask you. I’m also going to ask on
series 1, just to give you a little time to relax here, some of these rather simple
questions such as: “Did you voluntarily request this test?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You have already indicated your answer to that. And, I will
ask a rather obvious question as a matter of identity, “Is your first name Jack?
Is your last name Ruby?” These types of questions will be asked and I want to
make sure I cover each and every one. I’m going to ask you, “Do you use the
middle name ‘Leon’?” I understand you do; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; very rarely, very rarely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, you can answer that as you see fit, when I ask it on
the test. I will ask you this question, and I want to ask this as a matter of
record for me because I interview a lot of people: “Have you ever been arrested?”
Now, what I mean in this regard, and I’ll probably change that phraseology to
“Have you ever been arrested before? Prior to the shooting, have you ever been
arrested?” Now, what I mean by “arrested,” Mr. Ruby, is were you ever actually
placed under arrest and brought before some type of magistrate and charged with
any crime. That question will also be on the first examination. Those are
the questions I’m going to ask you. Do you have any questions about them, sir?
Are they clear and concise to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. When you speak of the last question about a crime, I’ve never been
involved in a crime, so if you’ve been arrested for selling beer after hours, does
that qualify as an answer too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Well, what I mean by “arrested” is if you were formally charged
with something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Like a felony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Well, any type of a formal arrest, wherein you actually were
arrested and charged before a magistrate, of offending a law that’s on the
record, either of a community, a city, or the State.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You don’t necessarily have to have been found guilty or anything,
just the point of being arrested, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Now, let me inject this, Mr. Ruby. If these questions when I
ask them, if you have something in doubt in your mind of how to answer it “Yes”
or “No,” just refrain from answering it, and we’ll go back after the test and
discuss it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. In other words, I want you to be able to freely and truthfully
say “Yes” or “No” to these questions. If one of them leaves any area of doubt
in your mind and you are hesitant to answer it, feel free not to say anything,
and we will just proceed, and after I stop the instrument, I will then go over
that question with you. All right, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, Mr. Ruby, I’ll just briefly hook up the instrument
and I’ll probably run it for a little while just to get it adjusted to you, and
inasmuch as you’ve never had a polygraph before, I will explain the instrument’s
parts to you. You can see here, Mr. Ruby, I have a rubber tube and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">520</span>
I’m going to place that around your chest, sir. This is what we call the
pneumograph and that will accurately record you respiratory pattern as you
inhale and exhale. Would you be kind enough to raise your arms, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span> (complied with request of Mr. Herndon).</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 2:58 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Now, as you can see, as you inhale the tube stretches, and as
you exhale it decreases in size and I will have a tracing of it on the polygraph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. During the examination and as we run the test, I would appreciate
it if you would sit perfectly relaxed, rather straight in the chair,
with both of your feet flat on the floor. Now, that will record, during the
interview, the tracing of your breathing, and I want you for this reason to
breathe perfectly normal and perfectly relaxed. Now, the next thing I want
to put on will be on your hand and I’ll put it on your right hand here. I notice
you have one finger cut off on that hand. What happened there, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, running a nightclub you get involved in various altercations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Now, this next component that I want you to see will be what
we call the Galvanic Skin Response, GSR. I’m going to place these on your
fingers, and actually all this simply does, through these instruments and the
electronic processes, is to record any variance in the electrical conductivity or the
resistance of your skin. It’s helpful to me in this examination. Your hands
are very good. They are not sweating a bit. Is that too tight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Is it uncomfortable?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, Mr. Ruby. Now, neither one of these two components
will you feel at all. That will be no problem at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Now, the next component that I will put on your left arm,
because it’s closer to your heart, and this is the cardiograph cuff, and this
is going to give me an accurate tracing of any relative changes in your blood
pressure. These will just be relative changes. I won’t be able to necessarily
know what your blood pressure is. I will have relative blood pressure changes,
and I will also have on a chart a change in any heartbeat or heart rate you might
have.</p>

<p>Now, I am going to record all these physiological responses as we discuss the
questions, and as you answer them I will have an indication of what is taking
place physiologically, what is going on in your physical system, and which will
assist me in interpreting whether or not you may be deceiving with regard to
the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. What is your name, please, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wood</span>. Wood. I’m with the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Where is Shanklin, I thought he was supposed to be here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wood</span>. He is in town but he is not here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Isn’t Mr. Shanklin the chief?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Do you want to relax your arm, Mr. Ruby? Now, do you
have any questions about what I’ve done so far, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No. Do you want me to relate my story to you now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. No; I want you to sit perfectly still. There will be no conversation,
and I’m going to get the instrument adjusted to you. That will take
only a few minutes, so just sit and try not to move. I’m not going to ask
you any questions at this time. I just want to adjust the machine to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Herndon, have you now covered all the preliminaries up
to the point of asking the questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Just about. I will probably repeat some basic instructions
for Mr. Ruby just before we start asking him the questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right, then I think those who are going to leave should
leave now so that we are ready to go as soon as your instrument is in tune.</p>

<p>May the record show that Mr. Alexander has left the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Jack, do you have any objections to Mr. Tonahill being here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. If Tonahill is going to be here—I don’t believe he’s—I know
Bill Alexander is my friend, so he can stay, but Joe is supposed to be my
friend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Well, we’re not putting it on that basis, Jack. This is just purely
personal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Just let me tell you this, Fowler. I have nothing to gain by Joe
being here, because—I have nothing to gain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. All right, all right. Then, we will ask Joe and Mr. Alexander
to step out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You still want Alexander to step out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. I certainly think so, Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span> (addressing Mr. Alexander who was standing in the doorway to the
examining room). Now, Bill, don’t say I didn’t request you, now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. I know it, Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that Mr. Alexander and Mr. Tonahill have
just gone out of the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Mr. Ruby, it will take me a few moments to get this adjusted.
If you desire to talk to Mr. Fowler, if you can sit still and talk it will be all
right.</p>

<p>(Conference at this time between Mr. Fowler and Mr. Ruby out of the hearing
of the court reporter and others in the room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Do you want to sit still now, Mr. Ruby. I’m not going to ask
you any questions. I just want to get everything adjusted at this time. You
will hear a few scratching noises on the paper.</p>

<p>Now, will you take a deep breath, Mr. Ruby, and then relax, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span> (complied with request of Mr. Herndon).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Now, just breathe normally.</p>

<p>Now, if everyone will just be quiet for a few moments. There will be no questions
asked. I just want to get the instrument adjusted.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 3:05 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span> (snapped his fingers twice). I made that noise purposely, Mr.
Ruby. Now, I’m going to let you get the feel of that cuff as I inflate it, and there
will be a little bit of pressure put against your arm. You’ve had your blood
pressure taken by a doctor, I’m sure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You recall that. It will be the same feeling and I will have
to leave it on just for a matter of a few moments, and if you will sit perfectly
still and put your feet flat on the floor and look straight ahead.</p>

<p>I will now apply a little bit of pressure on that arm. You probably feel a
little pressure. All right, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. From time to time I may come over and raise and lower your
arm to make sure it’s perfectly relaxed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Do you feel your pulse beat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You can see and feel your pulse beat and in a moment you
can see how it records. Very fine, Mr. Ruby. You have been very cooperative.
I don’t think we will have any problem.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You can see the differences of nature—if certain things are wrong
or right, can’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Well, I have to very carefully interpret what I see. I’m going
to take all these things together at a later date into consideration, and I don’t
see any difficulty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Because—I want my chief to understand this here and see that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Are you a little more relaxed now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You seem to be. I don’t want to begin until you feel you are
perfectly relaxed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">522</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I’m very much relaxed because I have nothing—I’m not
sparring with it, so I must be relaxed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Very fine. I appreciate your cooperation very much and you
are cooperating with me very well.</p>

<p>In a moment, you can move your hand a little bit to get a little circulation.
You probably felt just a little tingling sensation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I felt a little bit of throbbing in these two fingers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Are they too tight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; that’s fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I can relax this a little bit on your arm. I just want it close
enough so that they won’t slip, just about like that. I don’t want this to cause
you any discomfort to you. Now, if you are about ready?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I am ready.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You remember, I’m going to ask you just the questions that we
discussed before and that’s all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You mean that’s all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Oh, no; this is just series 1, Mr. Ruby. We’re going to
cover many questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I’m going to go rather deliberately slow on this first one until
you become acquainted with the procedure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Believe me, I know the answers, so you can ask me as fast as you like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. During the test, again, if you will keep your feet on the floor
at all times, flat on the floor at all times, and try not to move. I know it’s hard
to sit perfectly still for the 3 to 4 minutes, but it is to your advantage to try to
keep from moving. If you have to cough or move, I’ll probably observe it and
take it into consideration.</p>

<p>During the examination, Mr. Ruby, I know we have other people in the room,
but I would appreciate it if you would just try to concentrate as if there were
just you and me in here and these questions are coming out and if you know
the answer in your own mind, I want you to truthfully answer them “Yes” or
“No.” Do not give any qualifying statement or additional comments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. On the other hand, if I come to one of these questions that
you’re not sure whether you want to say “Yes” or “No,” there is some area in
doubt, just don’t say anything and we’ll go back and discuss it later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. If you will, look right over here, look straight ahead at the wall
and relax, and hear my question and give your answer to it, “Yes” or “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I will tell you when I am going to begin. I will tell you when
this particular test is over, but do not relax or move until I give you the word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. As I say, you will hear a little scratching noise and I will be
marking the paper as we proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Can I speak?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Right now if you want to; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Fowler, I beg you to get Bill Alexander and Joe Tonahill back in
here. I tell you. Will you do it, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Jack, let’s go on just like it is now. I don’t want you to have any
apprehensions that we’re trying to keep anybody out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. It’s taking me about a minute to get the instrument warmed up
again here.</p>

<p>All right, I will now put a little pressure on that arm, Mr. Ruby, and I will
let you know when I’m going to begin. Once again, just answer the questions
truthfully, “Yes” or “No.”</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 3:10 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The test will now begin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span>
“Is your first name Jack?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Is your last name Ruby?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you voluntarily request this test?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you know Oswald before November 22, 1963?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Do you use the middle name ‘Leon’?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span> (no immediate response). How can I answer that? I don’t have
my driver’s license, but I don’t use it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, just sit still and we will discuss it. “Did you assist
Oswald in the assassination?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Have you ever been arrested?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you take any medication this morning?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Have you answered all my questions truthfully?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. This first series is over. If you will just sit still for a moment,
I will release the pressure on your arm, and you may now move your arm and
relax and get the circulation moving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I’m all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That wasn’t too bad, sir; was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span> (no response).</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 3:12 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Mr. Ruby, there are two questions I want to ask you about on
our first series.</p>

<p>I know you couldn’t refrain from laughing and talking about that middle name
of “Leon.” Do you want to further explain that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I don’t use it, so hence it’s sort of a remembrance of a very
good friend of mine. I used it on my driver’s license, but since then it has become
a habit of keeping it on my driver’s license, but I’ve never been called with
it and very rarely do I sign papers that way, but once I stated it on my driver’s
license, I had to follow through with it that way, and that’s the answer to it.
Once you have it on your driver’s license, you have to have it the same way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Do you like the name “Leon”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I did more for sentimental reasons, but as I went along later
I sort of dropped it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Is it actually on your driver’s license, though?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I think it’s Jack L. Ruby. No—Jack Leon Ruby. It’s Jack Leon
Ruby on my driver’s license and that’s something that once you start with it, and
its been years ago, when you renew your license, it remains the same, but outside
of signing papers or contracts or anything of vital importance, you only
find out it’s much simpler to sign “Jack Ruby.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, Mr. Ruby, and one other question. I would just
like to ask you what went on in your mind when you did answer the question
“Yes” to “Have you ever been arrested?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, the police had taken me—I had been arrested, because when
the police officer said, “Jack, come on, we’re taking you down,” you’re arrested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. When was this? Are you referring to this current or some
previous time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Previous to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. What situation was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, it was—I was arrested for dancing after curfew. Some
fellows smuggled in intoxicants after hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Was this here in your own place or some other place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. At my own place. No felony crime, nothing serious—only misdemeanors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You consider that was a misdemeanor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes; in other words—a $25 fine. I never have been in any
criminal activity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Very fine. Does your arm feel all right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Very good. We have finished with the first series.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I am now going to ask Mr. Alexander and Mr. Tonahill to
return between now and the time we start on the next test.</p>

<p>May the record show that Mr. Alexander and Mr. Tonahill are back in the
room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Did the cardiounit disturb you at all other than just a slight
tingling sensation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In this arm here [indicating left arm]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Did that bother you before the series No. 1 group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; that’s fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Mr. Ruby, you are now a veteran of the first series. You did
real well. You cooperated very fine.</p>

<p>Now, we will proceed with series No. 2. I want to go over these questions
with you so that you and I understand precisely and perfectly what they mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Now, in this series of questions, I am going to ask as one of
the ones which is pertinent in this investigation, “Are you now a member of the
Communist Party?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You don’t have to answer that if you don’t want to now, but
I’m going to ask you that question, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. OK.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You understand what I mean by that—that’s about as short
and sweet as we can get it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I’m going to ask you, “Have you ever been a member of the
Communist Party?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You understand the difference—one is now and one is—have
been perhaps sometimes in your youth or life—if you were affiliated with the
Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I’m going to ask you this question, Mr. Ruby: “Are you now
a member of any group that advocates the violent overthrow of the United
States Government?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Do you understand that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I’m going to ask: “Have you ever been a member of any group
that advocates the violent overthrow of the United States Government?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. It’s very similar, only it’s in the past tense.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Ruby, on those two questions—we can’t go through all of
those groups which advocate the overthrow of the United States Government,
so we are generalizing with respect to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You have indicated you understand them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; and my answer is “No—no collaborating.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I don’t think it is necessary to elaborate on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, in addition to those questions, I’m going to ask you
a relatively simple question as this, that you should be able to answer “Yes” or
“No.” “Were you born in the United States?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Were you born in Chicago?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Now, this next question I’m going to ask you, you don’t have
to answer it now. You can discuss it with me later or you can wait and decide
what you want to answer to it. “Did you ever make a false official statement?”</p>

<p>Now, that’s a general question and I realize that, Mr. Ruby, and when I ask
that question, obviously your mind probably went back to many things. We
make a lot of official statements. Now, I’m asking that question in its broadest
terms. In other words, to your recollection, have you ever made a false official
statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. When you say “official”—for instance, in order to have a job
years ago—I want to explain this to you. In order to work in a department
store, I had to use another name because this other person would be the right
age that I could work, but outside of that, officials—to any authorities—I
haven’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Obviously, this department store thing came to your mind
when I asked that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Well, sir, I’m glad you brought that out so I will have an
understanding that that was in your mind. What I mean here, however, is
something more in the nature of an application for a license, an application for
a permit, an application for insurance—anything that would come within the
jurisdiction of being somewhat a legal or semilegal form or application?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I want to make sure you understand what I mean by that
question.</p>

<p>Then, I’ll probably ask, I understand you were born in 1911, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. These are questions of identity—“Were you born in 1911?”</p>

<p>Now, let me see, gentlemen, if we have gone over all the questions. I have
gone over all the questions with Mr. Ruby that I’m going to ask for this next
series.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right, prior to the administration of the second series, Mr.
Alexander and Mr. Tonahill are now leaving the room again.</p>

<p>May the record show that Mr. Alexander and Mr. Tonahill have now departed
from the room.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 3:20 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, now just relax. Can I get you a drink of water or
anything, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I’m perfectly all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, very fine. Once again, if you will try to refrain from
moving, simply look straight again, and sit perfectly still and answer the questions
“Yes” or “No.” I again will tell you when I am going to begin, Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>Now, are you relaxed? Are you OK?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. How does your arm feel? I noticed you had a little bit of
pressure there around the cuff. Is the circulation all right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You feel fine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. It will take me a moment again here to get the instrument adjusted.
Before I put any pressure on the cuff, Mr. Ruby, I’m going to just
tighten this up just slightly, do you want to move up just a moment? Does that
bind you in any way or is it too tight [checking tube around Mr. Ruby’s chest]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, now just lean back relax. All right, sir. Now,
we’re getting a better tracing. All right, I am going to now put a little pressure
on and I will tell you when I am going to begin.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 3:23 p.m.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Now, I’m checking this just so you can raise and lower your
arm and keep relaxed. Look straight ahead, Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 3:25 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I will now begin.</p>

<p>“Were you born in the United States?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Were you born in Chicago?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Are you now a member of the Communist Party?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Have you ever been known by another name?”</p>

<p>Don’t answer that question. I didn’t review it before. Skip it. Just sit and
relax.</p>

<p>“Have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you ever make a false official statement?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Are you now a member of any group that advocates the violent
overthrow of the United States Government?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Have you ever been a member of any group that advocates
violent overthrow of the United States Government?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Were you born in 1911?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That concludes that series. Just sit still for a moment, sir.</p>

<p>All right, you may now move your arm and relax, Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 3:27 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. There was one irrelevant question that I failed to mention
here. We will discuss that in a moment, and that is, “Have you ever been
known by another name?”</p>

<p>You might want to mention that to the gentlemen, as a matter of record. I
told him to refrain from answering it. It’s really not that pertinent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Fine, we will bring it to their attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. But, as long as I did ask it, if you want, I’d like him to answer
it before the other gentlemen come in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I think that’s all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Have I ever had it changed legally, is that what you meant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. In other words, when I asked you that question, I realized I
hadn’t gone over it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Therefore—I know you hesitated to answer it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I have two names—my name was Rubenstein and was
changed to Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That’s what came to your mind, the fact that you actually had
your name changed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We are now between series Nos. 2 and 3?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. How many series do I have now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I don’t know quite yet, Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let the record show that Mr. Alexander and Mr. Tonahill are
back in the room.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, there was one question which Mr. Herndon did not go over in
advance and that was, “Was Mr. Ruby ever known by any other name?” Since
he did ask it, but since it was obvious as soon as he had asked it that he had
not gone over it, he asked Mr. Ruby not to answer it, and when the series was
over, he asked Mr. Ruby the question again and Mr. Ruby said that he had been
known previously as “Jack Rubenstein” and had legally changed his name.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span>
With that one variation, all the questions asked during that series were identical
with those discussed before you left the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. My apologies, gentlemen, but it was an irrelevant question.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruby, we shall now proceed to what we call series No. 3. Here again
these questions are going to be intermixed, some rather pertinent to what we’re
interested in here, others general questions. Let me go over the relevant questions,
first, Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>“Between the assassination and the shooting, did anybody you know tell you
they knew Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, you understand, Mr. Ruby, when he says “the shooting,”
that means the shooting of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Repeat that over again—let me hear it again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I think you realized that, but I want to make certain that you
understand, and I want to go back and break down that question—between the
assassination of President Kennedy and the shooting—now, the shooting I
mean is the shooting of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes—yes—the answer is “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I realize you understood the question, but the shooting in some
other person’s mind could be many things. I want to keep these sentences as
concise and short as possible.</p>

<p>“Did anybody you know tell you they knew Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Do you understand the question, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you tell anyone that you were thinking of shooting Oswald
before you did it?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Is that question all right, do you understand it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes—I take that back. Sunday morning—I want to elaborate on
that—before I left my apartment—it evidently didn’t register with the person
because of the way I said it. In other words, the whole basis of this whole thing
was that Mrs. Kennedy would have to come back for trial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Jack, let me ask you at this time—excuse my interruption, but
why don’t you just address yourself to the general questions that are asked you.
I think it’s all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. I don’t think it will help the Commission, and this may be in
the form of a question later on, but just confine your answer to “Yes” or “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, the thing is this—I have to answer—ask me the question
again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Let’s go over it once more, Mr. Ruby, and I want you to be able
to be in a position that you can freely, honestly, and truthfully answer it simply
“Yes” or “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Now, if there’s something in here in this area that troubles you,
we can rephrase the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Will you specify the time—the time element is very important.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The only time element is before—before you did it. Now,
“before” is a very broad coverage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s it. That’s a difficult question to answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That’s the way the question is worded. Let me ask it again
and see if you want to discuss it. “Did you tell anyone that you were thinking
of shooting Oswald before you did it?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span> [no response].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. If you want me to reword that question, I’ll take it up with
Mr. Specter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Why don’t you say this—“that Sunday morning, specifically?”
That would be easier for me to answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. In other words, “Did you tell anyone you were thinking of
shooting Oswald on Sunday morning?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Jack, again, excuse me, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Fowler, it puts me in a tough spot when he asks me that question
and I evade it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. I understand this, but I’m talking now specifically about in the
presence of Mr. Alexander. Now, later on, if you want to answer it “Yes” or
“No” to that question, it’s perfectly all right. I want you to fully understand
the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I want to bow, of course, to Mr. Specter, of course, for the way
the Commission desires it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. If you would like us to break it down, we could do it in two
questions. “Did you tell anybody on Sunday morning that you were going to
shoot Oswald before you did it?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, that’s easier to answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then, we can ask you this: “Before Sunday morning did you
tell anybody you intended to shoot Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Now, that’s a better way to ask it—the last question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then, we’ve covered all the time in two parts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The last question you asked me is a better way to ask me. The last
question you asked, my answer is “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then, we’ll want to ask you a followup question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Do you understand what I’m saying—did you understand what
I said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, I understand what you’re saying, but we will want to ask you
for the purpose of the test, “On Sunday morning did you tell anybody that
you intended to shoot Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right. I’ll answer it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. If I could get the court reporter to read back how you phrased
that question, so that we could both agree on it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Court Reporter.</span> “On Sunday morning did you tell anybody that you intended
to shoot Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. There are two questions. “Before Sunday morning, did you
tell anyone you intended to shoot Oswald?” That’s all right for one question.
Now, write this one down, Mr. Herndon. The question is “Before Sunday
morning did you tell anyone that you intended to shoot Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Now, before Sunday morning means any time element beyond the
time I left my apartment. Is that what you’re referring to when you say
Sunday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, I’ll even change that and I’ll say “Before you left your
apartment on Sunday morning, did you tell anyone you intended to shoot
Oswald?”</p>

<p>Now, the following question will be: “From the time you left your apartment
on Sunday morning, did you tell anyone you intended to shoot Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Now, you better rephrase that. I hadn’t already left the apartment.
Do you follow me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Right. Well, I see what you’re driving at—you’re driving at the
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The time element is very important.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right, we can make it in three parts: “While you were at
your apartment on Sunday morning, did you tell anyone you intended to shoot
Oswald?”</p>

<p>Now, we’ve broken it up three ways. That would really be covered, Mr.
Ruby, in the first part: “Before you left your apartment on Sunday morning,
did you tell anyone you intended to shoot Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Now, you’ve got to get another question in there: “Previous to
your arising that morning, have you told anyone you’re going to shoot Oswald?”
You see my point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; before you awakened, in other words?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. “Before you awakened on Sunday morning, had you told anyone
you intended to shoot Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Before I awakened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Ruby, I don’t want to leave any area of questionableness
here or ambiguity—of course, you didn’t say in your sleep this, so perhaps we
ought to phrase it “Before you went to bed on Saturday night or early Sunday
morning did you tell anyone you intended to shoot Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Would you repeat that, Mr. Specter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes. “Before you went to bed——”</p>

<p>What time did you go to bed that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. At 1:15 or 1:30, but you must put it specifically—also, whether I
received any phone calls from the time I went to bed and the time I arose. Do
you follow me? In other words, I could clear myself by answering that question
truthfully, but I could have received a phone call in between the time I went
to bed and the time I awakened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. So, the area we’re trying to cover here, Mr. Ruby, as I see it
is—if you did tell anyone you were thinking of doing this—the approximate time.</p>

<p>Is that what we’re getting at, Mr. Specter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Now, we can phrase that in several different ways. If your
recollection is that good that you specifically recall an incident, you can tell
me how you want me to ask it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. May I make a suggestion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Ask it, “Did you tell someone by telephone you intended to
shoot Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Plus the fact that I think it should be included, “Did I talk to
anyone before going to bed?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Mr. Specter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Now, we will certainly object to a question being framed by this
attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Fowler, do I understand your position correctly, that you
are concerned about the disclosure of this information in the presence of Mr.
Alexander?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But, do you have any concern about disclosing the answer to this
question to the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, would it be agreeable with you if Mr. Alexander leaves
while this question is being formulated so we can understand it, and then that he
comes back when we have formulated it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Jack knows that I know the answer to it, so there’s no use in
anybody getting upset about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Are you sure you know the answer to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. I think so, Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. It would be preferable if he would leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Alexander, do you have any objection to stepping out just
while we formulate this question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Not at all, not at all. Come on Joe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. I don’t have to go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Alexander has now departed, may the record show.</p>

<p>All right, Mr. Ruby, we want to phrase the question in accordance with
polygraph procedure in a way that gets to the point, as you see the point. So,
tell us exactly what you have in mind here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, you had better remind me again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Here’s the area we’re trying to cover. Here’s the question I
originally asked you which created all this problem. “Between the assassination
and the shooting”—now, let me start that again—“Did you tell anyone that
you were thinking of shooting Oswald before you did?”</p>

<p>Now, I tried to put that as plainly as I could. I’m not interested here in
the area of <span class="locked">when——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, but if you’re speaking in the area of when, it’s pretty incriminating.
It’s a long premeditation, then, of time element.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I think the Commission here has its question of whether or
not you did tell anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Ruby, if you have no objection to answering that question,
we would like you to do so now for purposes of giving us information, and
then we will test you in just a minute as we go through with the polygraph, if
you’re willing to answer that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Clayton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Jack, let me say this—now, this is the very crux of your case.
In other words, if there is premeditation on your part to murder or to kill,
this can and will be used against you, and this information—let’s project it
a little bit and say that you do get a new trial, and that between now and that
the Warren Commission releases their information for public consumption or
to the district attorney’s office or to anybody else, then, if your answer to these
questions might be “Yes,” then it would be most difficult to appear and defend
you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Clayton, I’m here to tell the truth. I don’t know how the heck to
answer it. I appreciate you’re in a tough spot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Well, of course, as you can readily see, this is why we advised
you not to take this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s why I want it, because I know what’s best for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Well, I don’t think you do, Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Can I overrule you, Clayton, where you won’t be too angry if I
overrule you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Well, I have no—I’m not going to put a cob in your mouth, Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Can I ask one more favor of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Will you let those two gentlemen back in the room, at your request?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Not at my request; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Please, Clayton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. If you leave that up to me, I say, “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right, I’m going to answer your question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Mr. Ruby, why don’t I just go over with you once again all
of them, for this series of questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At this time, I would like to ask Mr. Ruby if he is willing to
answer the question about the conversations. I would like to develop the
information about the conversations so that we will know it is factual. This
would be an extended question of the nature that the Chief Justice asked you
on June 7—if you’re willing to answer my question to you at this time, which
is: “Did you tell anybody that you intended to shoot Oswald at any time before
you did it?” And, I would follow that up, if you answer that question, with,
“Whom did you tell and when?” With that information, we can then formulate
these questions for the lie detector test to see if you’re telling the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Clayton, please? I’ve got to do this? I’ve got to, because I told
it to the Warren Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. In other words, these questions have already been talked about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; and will you ask them to come in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Fowler, I don’t know that they have. I have reviewed the
transcript, but I don’t know that we’ve asked these before, but he answered
everything that was asked of him in the last session.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, I was very voluntary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We deliberately didn’t go into some areas, suffice it to say, for
certain purposes. But this is the question we’re concerned with at the moment,
and we would like an answer substantively, in addition to testing his truthfulness.
It comes to a head when we try to formulate the questions for the
polygraph, because we really have to get the underlying facts, and then we
can point our efforts to see whether he’s telling the truth according to the
indicators from the examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Again, I don’t believe certainly he understands the full complicity
of this thing. If there are any questions that are asked that show
premeditation on his part, I would respectfully ask that he decline to answer
and that you decline to ask it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. But it’s already in there. I’ve already told it to the Warren
Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Now, if there is an area that has been covered already and
you still wish to go into it—I don’t want this <span class="locked">man——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. So, would you mind calling Alexander in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Listen, Jack, will you please listen to me? This man got up
down there and asked the jury to send you to the electric chair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I know it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. He has not changed his opinion yet, and he will again ask it at
some later date. Now, is this the kind of man you want to pussyfoot around
in here with and let listen to these questions? Just “Yes” or “No”—if it is—we’ll
bring him back in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes: I want him in here, and I want you to ask him to come in,
please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. I won’t ask him to come in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Joe, ask him to come in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. No; Clayton is your chief counsel and I’m going to respect
his desires.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Chief—I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, I will ask him to come in, Mr. Ruby. I’m willing to bring
him back, if that’s your request.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. I would like this record to reflect that this is against the advice
of his attorneys present, and that it will be very detrimental to, No. 1, his appeal,
and No. 2, perhaps to any clemency that might be asked for in the future, and
No. 3, for the actual trial of the case on the merits, if such ever occurs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Ruby, the Commission can proceed and conduct this test and
not bring him back. I want you to be clear on that point, that these men do not
have to be here for the purposes of getting this information for the Commission,
so we will know all the facts, or for the purposes of conducting this
test. So, it’s really extraneous. It doesn’t really matter for them to be in here
for the tests.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Jack, why do you want them back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Because I happen to know what I’m talking about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Now, <span class="locked">Jack——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Joe, you’re not my attorney any more. We know it. We understand
one another, please. You’re not helping me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Let’s just direct our attention right now, Jack, to the things that
are near to you. Why do you want Mr. Alexander here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I feel I don’t want him to think I’m holding out on anything. I
don’t want him to have any idea that I’m reluctant to answer things in front of
him, believe me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Listen, at some future date—yes. Perhaps in a trial, another
trial, yes. When you are on the witness stand, if you are able to go to the witness
stand, perhaps these questions will be directed to you at that time, and you
can make a full disclosure before a jury, but I respectfully request that you do
not do it in the presence of a district attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. But Clayton, they know all these questions already. Henry Wade,
I spoke to, and I told him all this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Well, if he knows them already, then why not just let him stay
out? You’re not trying to impress him, are you? Do you think that he can do
anything to help you right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no; but the thing is that I have a few other thoughts in mind,
as you well know about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. What are they, Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That I spoke to you about for your consideration.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Jack, I’m not worried, I’m not concerned about anybody trying to
do away with me. This is the least of my worries. Nobody has threatened me
about this thing. Nobody has coerced me in any way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I want harmony, that’s what I want. I want harmony with you
and the district attorney’s office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Well, we can’t harmonize over your situation, I’m sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, the point we got to was the question of getting the substantive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span>
information out before going on with the test. Did you tell anyone that
you intended to shoot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You mean—before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, I don’t know if we’re going to get an answer to it or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Jack, now the question that is being directed to you at this time—well,
go right ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes: Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And whom did you tell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. George Senator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where were you at the time you discussed it with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In my apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And state in as precise words as you can remember, just what
you said to him and he said to you at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, he didn’t say anything—the funny part—he was reading the
paper and I doubt if he even recalled me saying it. I have to elaborate on it,
but I was so carried away emotionally that I said—I don’t know how I said
it—I didn’t say it in any vulgar manner—I said, “If something happened to
this person, that then Mrs. Kennedy won’t have to come back for the trial.”
That’s all I said. Now, would you mind asking me on that particular point?
That happened Sunday morning. That’s the only time any thought ever came to
my mind, because that morning I read some articles in the newspaper that she
would have to come back to trial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever say to anybody, “I am going to shoot Oswald,”
or anything to the effect that, “I am going to shoot or kill him”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I just made the statement—that’s the only thing I said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That statement you made to George Senator, that’s the only
thing, that’s the closest you came to saying it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That Sunday morning before I left my apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever tell Randolph Paul you were going to shoot him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t even know a Randolph Paul.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about Breck Wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I know I never said that to Breck Wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Perhaps the name was Ralph Paul. Did you ever say it to
Ralph Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, let’s prepare the question this way, if we may, Mr. Herndon:
“Aside from anything you said to George Senator, did you ever tell anyone
you intended to shoot Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, is that formulation acceptable for purposes of the test,
Mr. Herndon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I want to make sure I get it correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. “Aside from anything you said to George Senator, did you ever
tell anyone else you intended to shoot Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In the flippant way I said it, I doubt if he’d even—you know—the
poor guy may not even have remembered it. We never discussed it after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the exact time you recollect you said that to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know—it was about 10:15 Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, you know—10 minutes either way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right, Mr. Fowler, we will phrase the question in that way,
but that phraseology of the question carries certain implications which you
understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. May I repeat that question once more to make sure it’s accurate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Alexander can come back in.</p>

<p>(Mr. Alexander at this time entered the room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We have now formulated the question, Mr. Alexander, and Mr.
Herndon will now read it, together with the other questions he intends to ask
in this series.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The question is, “Aside from anything you said to George Senator,
did you ever tell anyone else that you intended to shoot Oswald?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">533</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That will be one of the questions on the next series.</p>

<p>Mr. Specter, do you want that to be in lieu of this one or in addition to this
question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let’s ask it in lieu of that question. Strike the other question,
the original question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Strike the original question that commences, “Did you tell anyone
you were thinking about”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; that’s the one we’ve been talking about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Is this still series 3?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. We’re still on series 3. Mr. Alexander. As a matter of fact, if
it’s all right with you gentleman, I’d like to start right over again on series 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Ruby, I think we have that one area resolved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I’m going to ask you as we said originally—before—back in the
testimony. “Between the assassination and the shooting, did anybody you know
tell you they knew Oswald?”</p>

<p>Then, the other relative or pertinent question here will be, “Aside from anything
you said to George Senator, did you ever tell anyone else that you intended
to shoot Oswald?”</p>

<p>And, in addition to those questions, I will ask on this series the following
<span class="locked">questions——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Why don’t you add—in—let’s get the time element in there, too,
because that was Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Well, I don’t want to make these questions too long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I know, but I want this because somebody might think that I mentioned
it 2 days prior to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We can add if you want to. “Aside from anything you said to
George Senator on Sunday morning, did you ever tell anyone else that you
intended to shoot Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. OK.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, we’re going to insert after “George Senator”—“on
Sunday morning.” Here again, the Sunday morning being that time after you
woke up and prior to noon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Remember, it was the flippant way I said it that I doubt if the poor
soul remembered it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The other questions in this series will be as follows, Mr. Ruby.
Here again are some of the irrelevant questions. “Is your last name Ruby? Do
you live in Dallas?” I’m going to ask you “Are you married?” Just for the
record, I understand you’re single, so you could answer that “No.” “Were you
in the military service?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I’m going to ask you this question: “While in service,” and
I mean the military service, “did you receive any disciplinary action?” Do
you understand that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In other words, “While you were in the military, were you hurt?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. No; Mr. Ruby, disciplinary action. Were you court-martialed,
captains’ mast, or any disciplinary action?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. There’s one other relevant question I want to ask on this series
and I put it as simply as I can. “Did you shoot Oswald in order to silence
him?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. One other question: “Have you ever served time in jail?”
Now, what I mean by that question, Mr. Ruby, is not this present custody
but any other time. “Did you ever actually serve time in jail?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I have served 30 days—I mean—that would answer it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Then, you can answer that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. If that comes to mind, you could say, “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Now, let me make sure we’ve gone over these questions. Do you
feel all right, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, we will proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That 30 days embarrasses me, because it was with reference
to selling some song sheets back in the old depression days, and it wasn’t for anything
criminal. It was something that I didn’t realize at the time there were
copyrights on those songs. So, I don’t want to become a felon just because—outside
of what I am now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Well, these questions, I don’t mean to embarrass you, Mr.
Ruby. I want to ask these questions because they’re going to help me later
on, and I want to get some of these other questions on your background. Was
that in Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. When you explained about the song sheets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I made a pretty good living at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You still recall that and it embarrasses you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I will be ready to start series 3 in a moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right, if Mr. Alexander and Mr. Tonahill will leave the
room, we will proceed with series 3.</p>

<p>May the record show that Mr. Alexander and Mr. Tonahill are now absent.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 3:58 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Of course, we have been moving around and talking, Mr. Ruby,
I’m going to make a few minor adjustments here. Are you comfortable, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Now, I’m going to put this up a little higher on your chest, and
I want you to lean back and relax. Do you want to put your feet flat on the
floor during the test, if you will.</p>

<p>All right. I again will tell you when we actually start the test. I’m going to
put a little pressure on the arm, and once again, on these questions, if you will
answer them simply “Yes” or “No” truthfully. Will you look straight ahead,
please, sir.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 3:59 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The test will now begin. Look straight ahead, Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>“Is your last name Ruby?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Do you live in Dallas?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Between the assassination and the shooting, did anybody you
know tell you they knew Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Are you married?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Aside from anything you said to George Senator on Sunday
morning, did you ever tell anyone else that you intended to shoot Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Were you in the military service?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “While in service did you receive any disciplinary action?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you shoot Oswald in order to silence him?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Have you ever served time in jail?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span> (no response).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The test is over. Sit still for a moment and we will release
the pressure on your arm.</p>

<p>Do you feel a little better when I release that pressure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. When you elaborate on “serving time”, 30 days isn’t serving time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I was going to ask you to explain that, and you followed instructions
explicitly there.</p>

<p>Then, actually in explanation to that, this 30 days to you were insignificant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, yes, but I explained that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That’s all right. I have to ask these questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">535</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. To serve time is when you refer to a man being in the penitentiary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Now, there are a few questions I want to ask him with regard
to that series.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Just two points I want to clarify for my own use here.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruby, I asked you. “Are you married?” and you replied “No.” Could
you tell me if anything went on in your mind at the time you responded “No”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I was thinking of the young girl, that had I been married I
wouldn’t have been in this trouble. I guess that’s what flashed back in my
mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Is this a former sweetheart?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes. What else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I just wanted to get your explanation at that particular point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You noticed something there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Did you feel anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I knew I wasn’t—something was working on me when you
asked me that. I would probably have been living in another part of the city,
and I wouldn’t have been involved in this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Do you recall the girl’s name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes—Alice Nichols.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. And how long ago was this that you were acquainted with
her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, for many years, and I guess we severed relations in 1959—“relations”—I
meant our company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That’s the last time you were dating?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; we were engaged and so on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You never actually married this young lady?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, sir. That’s why you see me in a moment of despair—like I
am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Did you ever consider marrying her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, that clarifies that question for me. One other area
I’d like you to speak frankly and freely on, and here again it gets back to this
military service. I asked you, “While in the military service, did you ever
receive any disciplinary action?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Did you ever get in any trouble at all while you were in the
service that came to your mind during that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. When you say “trouble”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Disciplinary action for trouble?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I have never been called down for anything. I may have
had a brawl with another soldier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Did you while you were in the service ever have a fight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; but when you speak of “disciplinary” is when you go before
a court-martial or the colonel calls you in or something happens.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Were you called in before the commanding officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Sure; but it’s not important enough to answer. Evidently, you’re
getting a pretty good reading?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I’m having no technical difficulty with regard to giving the
test.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I wish you would prove to my chief here, over there, how I stand
with you (referring to Mr. Holman).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I want to study these very carefully, of course, but you have
been very cooperative, as far as running the actual examination. That will complete
series 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Fine, I will call the gentlemen in.</p>

<p>Let the record show that Mr. Tonahill and Mr. Alexander have returned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. We will go on to another series now. I am going to run a little
different type of examination, Mr. Ruby, if you still feel like you want to continue.
Do you want to take a break?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, I want to go on completely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You are not tired?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">536</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. This next one will be relatively short, and it won’t take too
long.</p>

<p>I’m going to ask you these questions somewhat in sequence and in consecutive
order. There are five of them. They can be answered simply by “yes”
or “no.”</p>

<p>“Did you first decide to shoot Oswald on Friday night?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you first decide to shoot Oswald on Saturday morning?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you first decide to shoot Oswald Sunday morning?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. And last, I’ll ask you, “Have you answered all questions truthfully?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. In addition to those questions I’ve just asked, I’m going to ask,
again to establish identity, “Is your first name Jack?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Is your last name Ruby?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I will ask you of those questions that I have just related to you,
those pertinent five questions in consecutive order, with considerable spacing
and time between—I believe you understand what I mean by Friday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Definitely—the period of meditation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That’s right—in the evening after 6 o’clock, and Saturday morning
we consider as being that time from when you wake up until you have lunch,
and I think you understand these questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Also, is there any way you can ask me if my family had known of
my doing anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. We may possibly get into that area or perhaps take that up
with Mr. Specter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, actually, Mr. Ruby, we have a great many questions to ask
you and there are certain limitations on the test.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I am going to proceed on this particular series now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. Mr. Alexander and Mr. Tonahill are leaving the room,
and may the record show both have now departed.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 4.08 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Did you want to tell me something before, Mr. Ruby, before I
start?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Again, I will tell you when the test begins.</p>

<p>Will you let the record show that I have these designated as series 3a.</p>

<p>All right, do you feel all right now, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Sit perfectly still and try to concentrate and look straight ahead
and answer the questions truthfully “Yes” or “No.”</p>

<p>I now put some pressure on that arm cuff.</p>

<p>The test will now begin.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 4:10 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Is your first name Jack?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Is your last name Ruby?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you first decide to shoot Oswald on Friday night?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you first decide to shoot Oswald on Saturday morning?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you first decide to shoot Oswald on Saturday night?”</p>

<p>Mr. Ruby. “No”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you first decide to shoot Oswald on Sunday morning?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Have you answered all questions truthfully?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">537</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The test is over. Will you sit still a moment. I will release
the pressure on your arms. You may now move your hands and get the circulation
back.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 4:12 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I have no questions on that.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruby came in here what time—originally?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Court Reporter</span>. My notes indicate around 2 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. How do you feel, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You’re not tired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Mr. Ruby, you are perfectly relaxed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. As long as Mr. Ruby feels fine, I think we can continue and we
can prepare the exact wording for the next series.</p>

<p>You may wish to bring the other gentlemen in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right, thank you.</p>

<p>Let the record show that Mr. Alexander and Mr. Tonahill have returned to the
room.</p>

<p>(Conference off the record between Messrs. Specter and Herndon regarding
formulation of questions.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Joe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Yes, Jack.</p>

<p>(Conference between Mr. Tonahill and Mr. Ruby from 4:13 to 4:15 p.m., out of
the hearing of this reporter and others in the room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Jack, you are a good man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Who, Bill?</p>

<p>(Conference between Mr. Alexander and Mr. Ruby from 4:15 to 4:18 p.m., out
of the hearing of this reporter and others in the room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Holman, what time do you feed Mr. Ruby? What time do
you start the evening meal?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Jailer</span>. Well, we begin about 4:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Are you hungry. Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, I’m feeling fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, let’s go ahead with this series of questions and then we
will take about a 20-minute break.</p>

<p>(Conference between Mr. Alexander and Mr. Ruby from 4:22 to 4:25 p.m.,
out of the hearing of this reporter and others in the room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right, we are ready to go on to the next series of questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Do you feel all right, Mr. Ruby, at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. We will now go to the first question of this next series, Mr.
Ruby, and I will ask you these questions. I want to make sure you have a
clear understanding of what they mean.</p>

<p>“Were you in the Dallas Police Department jail basement at the time Lieutenant
Pierce’s car drove out of the basement?”</p>

<p>Now, I see you are hesitating on that—I can rephrase it if you so like?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Let me go over it again, to make sure the question will be
clear to you.</p>

<p>“Were you in the Dallas Police Department jail at the time Lieutenant Pierce’s
car drove out of the basement?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. If I can explain it—if I can elaborate on it, it will be easy to
answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Go ahead now, if it’s all right with your counsel, so we can
focus in on what concerns you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Perhaps I might want to ask that other question first and he
would find he might not have as much of a problem if I asked it first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, I prefer to stay with what we have now. I think we can.
If it’s all right to have him explain it, if it’s all right with his attorney, I’d
rather stay with that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">538</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I’ve already told it to the Warren Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Well, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. As I left the Western Union, I walked toward the ramp, and as I
walked down, Lieutenant Pierce’s car was parked already on the curb, partly
on the curb and partly some of it was on the ramp, and some officer was talking
to him, so consequently—I don’t know how to answer that—whether I was in
the basement—when his car had driven out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you walk by his car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At the same time it was parked there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that the officer did not see <span class="locked">you——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span> (continuing). Because the car was parked there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; and his back was turned to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To state it differently, did the presence of the automobile and
the fact that he was talking to Lieutenant Pierce obscure the vision of the
officer who was on duty guarding that entrance or exit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; and I walked down because I didn’t know they were guarding
it—that there was anything going on there, you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Well, with that question, I can see his area of conflict here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. What you want to know is was he in the basement, but he
was out on the sidewalk. I think that’s a straight question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. “Were you in the basement or were you on the sidewalk
when Lieutenant Pierce’s car came out?” How about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes, I will revise that one question and break it down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Yes, that’s a very good question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, Mr. Ruby, will this question create any problem for
you? “Were you on the sidewalk at the time Lieutenant Pierce’s car”—I had
“drove out,” but was he driving out or was he parked there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. When I noticed him he was already—he was stationary. He was
parked. He had stalled there or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. “Were you on the sidewalk at the time Lieutenant Pierce’s car
stopped in front of the guard at the exit?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, yes. Why do you say “stopped at the exit?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. At the ramp exit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “The ramp exit”—that makes it specific.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruby, your question will then be, “Were you on the sidewalk at the
time Lieutenant Pierce’s car stopped on the ramp exit?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Or, would you prefer “at the ramp exit?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Let’s leave it “on the ramp exit.”</p>

<p>Another question I will ask, “Did you enter the jail by walking through an
alleyway?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. What do you call an alleyway—a ramp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. It’s a ramp, it isn’t an alley. It goes under the building and
comes out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That’s all right, we’ll stand on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You will stand on that question, Mr. Specter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. In other words, you can answer that as you want to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Now, if he says “No”——</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. It isn’t an alley, now, it’s a ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let me specify here—is there another entrance to the jail that
you have to go through an alleyway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. There’s another—the Commerce Street entrance, and there’s two
entrances, and there’s ways of coming through, I imagine, from <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. But it’s a driveway, is what it is, going down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. There’s nothing in the sense that you’re thinking of—you
could come from the building out where you could go down the ramp on either
side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">539</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. It’s all under the building, not the ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Actually, I think what he is thinking of is that there is an alley
too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. It wouldn’t be accessible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. It would make it very difficult to get down into the basement
from the alley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. All right, if Jack knows we’re talking about “alley,” as long
as you distinguish between the alley and the ramp, so he can answer your
question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. He has always referred to it as a ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s a ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. By “alley,” we do not mean the ramp. We mean the entrance
into the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Now, you’ve got him squared away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Fine. We want you to understand the question exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The question will stand as is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Why don’t you read the question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Just leave the question as it is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Leave it as it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The next question I’m going to ask, or one of the questions
I will ask will be, “Did you walk past the guard at the time Lieutenant Pierce’s
car was parked on the exit?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You said it was parked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I think I’ll put it “on the ramp exit” so it’s perfectly clear, and
I will repeat the question.</p>

<p>The question again, “Did you walk past the guard at the time Lieutenant
Pierce’s car was parked on the ramp exit?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Now, the other questions here, “Did you talk with any Dallas
police officers on Sunday, November 24, prior to shooting Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Other questions I intend to ask on this next series, Mr. Ruby
are: “Did you previously live in Chicago?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Are your parents alive?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. This next question, and you don’t have to answer it now. You
can answer it on the test. “Did you ever make a false insurance claim?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You are a man in business and you would probably have insurance
on perhaps your car, your personal life and your business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I just wondered if you ever made a false insurance claim?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No—I see what you mean—No, I have it on an automobile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I put this question in here—I’m not sure, actually, but “Do
you still operate the Carousel Club?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You don’t?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right. The questions will be: “Do you still operate the
Carousel Club? Were you on the sidewalk at the time Lieutenant Pierce’s car
stopped on the ramp exit? Did you previously live in Chicago? Did you
enter the jail by walking through an alleyway? Are your parents alive? Did you
walk past the guard at the time Lieutenant Pierce’s car was parked on the ramp
exit? Did you ever make a false insurance claim? Did you talk with any
Dallas police officers on Sunday, November 24, prior to the shooting of Oswald?”</p>

<p>Do you understand all those questions and can you answer them clearly and
simply “Yes” or “No”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Apparently this is series 5?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">540</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We called the last series, series 3a.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. We will call this series 4, according to my records. Is that
in sequence, Mr. Specter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; I believe it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I will proceed shortly then, gentlemen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Tonahill and Mr. Alexander have now left the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Mr. Ruby, do you want to put both of your feet on the floor
for me, sir, and look straight ahead at the wall, and relax until I get the
instrument adjusted.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 4:35 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, I will now put some pressure on the arm cuff, and
I will tell you when I am going to start asking you questions, Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>We will now begin.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 4:36 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Do you still operate the Carousel Club?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Were you on the sidewalk at the time Lieutenant Pierce’s
car stopped on the ramp exit?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you previously live in Chicago?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Try to sit still, if you can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you enter the jail by walking through an alleyway?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Are your parents alive?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you walk past the guard at the time Lieutenant Pierce’s
car was parked on the ramp exit?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you ever make a false insurance claim?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you talk with any Dallas police officers on Sunday,
November 24, prior to the shooting of Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That series is over. If you will sit still for a moment, Mr.
Ruby. I will now release the pressure from your arms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Am I acting a little nervous?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. A little, but I think you’re getting a little bit tired. That’s
quite all right. I notice a little motion, but I will certainly take that into
consideration when I evaluate and interpret these charts.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 4:40 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Is there any area of doubt at all in your mind about that
question where you were on the sidewalk at the time Lieutenant Pierce’s car
stopped at the ramp exit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I said I was on the sidewalk—I walked past.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes; did that question trouble you then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You were on the sidewalk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I just wanted to clarify that. When I asked you, “Are your
parents alive?”, Mr. Ruby, have they been deceased for some time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Did that question bother you or trouble you at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I don’t know—I guess I’m nervous now—I don’t know just
why I said that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I have no further questions in that series.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Aren’t you going to ask me whether I knew anything as to whether
or not he was going to come down, or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. We will have to prepare some more questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that Mr. Alexander and Mr. Tonahill
are now back in the room, and we are going to take a brief recess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">541</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You’ve done very well thus far, Mr. Ruby, as far as cooperating
on the examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. OK. What happens now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. We’re going to take a break and give you a little rest. Now,
if you will just lean forward and raise your arms, I will take this equipment
off of you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I’m not hungry, jailer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holman</span>. Do you want to go lie down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. We only have a 20-minute break. That’s all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Might I suggest to the jailer that you might like to sit at
another chair and change your position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 4:45 p.m.)</p>

<p>(The proceedings were in recess at this time from 4:45 p.m. to 6:25 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record now show that it is 6:25 p.m. and that we have
adjourned for a period of 1 hour and 40 minutes, during which time Mr. Ruby
has had an opportunity to rest. Is that correct, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Ruby has just asked me about the presence of reporters
downstairs, and would you get this in the record. Miss Oliver. Would you
repeat what you just said to me, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Are you going to make any announcement to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; and you asked me to speak freely about this matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. My view is that we should, in view of the circumstances, as I
have been told—there are a large number of reporters downstairs, and I’ve
discussed this with Mr. Fowler and Mr. Tonahill, and it’s our joint view that
there should be an announcement made that you have requested a polygraph
examination and that we have conducted one under the auspices of the President’s
Commission through the cooperation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
that there has been extensive examination and the results, of course, cannot
yet be known at this date, but they are to be taken to Washington and
studied for future action by the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Let’s make it clear that Mr. Tonahill don’t represent me. Joe,
let’s have that understanding?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Clayton is going to make whatever announcement is made for
you, Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Joe, let’s have that understanding, will you please, Joe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Jack, we’ll have no difficulty with that, don’t worry about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The substance of what I just said was discussed by me with Mr.
Fowler and it is our thought that that would be an appropriate statement to
make at this particular time. That’s about as far as we can go. Do you concur
in the advisability of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Now, with reference to hedging on questions and so on, don’t you
think some comment should be made that I wasn’t reluctant in answering any
of the questions that were put to me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I think that would be a fair comment to make, if you want that
statement made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. That there was cooperation. That he was cooperative.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; that he was cooperative.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. On all questions on anything and everything pertaining to anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Ruby, in view of your interest in that disclosure, I think
that would be appropriate to be made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. That without reservation, he cooperated fully.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I wanted to be more specific, that I wanted to be asked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, I said that initially. In other words, that it is at your
request that we had conducted this, so that it would be clear that you took the
lead in initiating this examination, which is the fact, and we will state the
fact or give you the credit in that direction, just as it is the fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. But the point I wanted to bring out was that I wanted to specify<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">542</span>
that I also wanted to be asked any and all questions, regardless of what might
be subversive or whatever thoughts might be in your mind.</p>

<p>Bill, I think you can give these people certain questions and more potent ones
than they know, because you probably know a lot of things that you have in your
own mind that you’d like to have answered too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Well, Jack, let me say this for your purpose and for the purpose
of the Warren Commission. This is not a trial and really, Mr. Alexander is
here as an attorney just like I am. He’s representing the State just as Mr.
Tonahill and I are representing you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Jack, I can’t really think of anything that I’d like to ask.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, let me get this clear. I notice that the pictures brought out
the fact that there are two sets of private boxes, close together in the post
office. Did you gentlemen know this? Which is quite an insinuation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Jack, let’s ask the question, “Did you meet Oswald at the
post office at any time, as far as you know, until the next day?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes—and also they had a statement in there that I used the box
for purpose of mail orders and to do business with Mexico and Cuba. That’s
incorrect because I never did business with Mexico and Cuba.</p>

<p>Now, these are things that you gentlemen don’t want to ask me, but Mr.
Alexander would know what to tell you about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. There is one question that ought to be asked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I want that, Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. “Did any Cuban or foreign influence cause you to do any act?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Very good—very good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Because there has been some question about maybe Jack
was motivated from Cuba and we ought to eliminate that and ask him a question
to give him a chance to eliminate it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Also, I want to get the gun situation straightened out. You know
what I’m talking about—the Ray Brantley call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. And the trip down to Cuba—I’m getting things confused now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Let’s let him write that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Ruby, we have conferred with all parties here on the substance
of the questions to be asked. Naturally, we have limitations in time
and we can only ask them in a short series. We have conferred with Mr.
Fowler, we have conferred with Mr. Wade and with Mr. Alexander here, and
naturally also, the interest of the Commission is paramount, and we are doing
our very best not to interfere with the State criminal proceedings. We do not
wish to take sides at all nor to influence it in any way. We want to accomplish
the purpose of the Commission. Those interests overlap to some extent because
whenever we ask a Commission question, it has collateral bearings on a great
many things, but to the extent that we can, we have conferred, as I say, with
the defense counsel and the representatives of the district attorney’s office in
arriving at the questions which have been asked, and I think we will cover before
this examination is concluded the important areas. Now, at the end of it, if
you feel that there is some other area that you would like to have covered, we
would be very willing to hear your request and to accommodate you to the
maximum extent possible consistent with the policy of the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Mr. Alexander knows certain questions that he has in his mind
that haven’t come out and I think I know what he’s thinking about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, Mr. Alexander has talked to me about some questions that
I’m sure he would prefer on the record and we have taken those into account in
formulating our questions. Isn’t that so, Mr. Alexander?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Yes, sir. I think what Jack has in mind is that he wants
an opportunity to answer a question regarding any possible connection with
anything in Cuba. Also, he wants a question asked that will give him an opportunity
to explain that the gun which he asked Ray Brantley to mail to
McWillie in Las <span class="locked">Vegas——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Not to Vegas, to Cuba, and all I did was to receive a phone call,
and this was—I told this to the Warren Commission—and this was during the
time when we were very friendly together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">543</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. That was in 1958.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All I did was relay the phone message to Ray Brantley, and he
said, “Oh, I know Mr. McWillie very well,” and following that I never followed
up or seen him. Now, this is incriminating for me because all I did—like a
tool—got myself involved by relating a message that somebody else wanted.
Now, this was during peacetime because he wanted protection from the foreign
element coming in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Jack relayed the message that McWillie wanted a Smith &amp;
Wesson or some kind of a .38.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes. There wasn’t no money or anything in the deal. Ray
Brantley said, “Oh, I know McWillie. I’ve done business with him constantly.”
Following that—I never followed up on it a time, and what he did—and this
is incriminating against me very bad, but he had the irony to do this—when
I mentioned the fact that I did call Ray Brantley, this man denied that I called
him. That makes me a liar to that extent, so I want that question put to me in
reference to Ray Brantley and all that and I want about my trip to Cuba and
my association with the underworld.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, the question of the gun with Ray Brantley was covered
in detail when the Chief Justice was here and we shall cover that in the balance
of the polygraph examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I also had numerous phone calls, long-distance calls, all over the
country and that was with relationship only to my nightclub that I had trouble
with the union. There was no conspiracy, but you’ll go into that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You covered that also in your testimony before the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; but that doesn’t prove anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Let me suggest one question there to ask him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. “Did any telephone call you made have any connection, however
remote, with your shooting of Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. That will cover it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. How about asking him if he didn’t tell the Warren Commission
the truth several weeks ago in answering every question they asked him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I didn’t elaborate enough with them and we didn’t go into it
enough, because I was telling a complete story. Yes; I’ll answer that—certainly
I will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Fine; that will be asked of you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That will be somewhat all inclusive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We’ll have that for the very next series.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. “Did you have any telephone conversation which related in
any way with the shooting of Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Also, ask me whether the phone calls were in reference to the
union trying to get somebody to help me with my club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Let’s make another question about that. “Did any union or
underworld connection have anything to do with the shooting of Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Very good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; I will add those in and cover them to the maximum extent
possible, and I add that reservation because there are a great many additional
questions to be asked which we have already mapped out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Do you want me to proceed with the usual preliminaries?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You don’t have to proceed with that. Why don’t you just call
them to me and I’ll answer them. You want to go through a formality—a previous
thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Jack, he’s got to have a record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I want to make sure you understand the question involved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I’m sure I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I feel in fairness to both of us, we have to do this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Believe me—believe me, you don’t have to go through that formality,
if you want to save yourself a lot of time, and I think you’ll like that
better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Jack, he has to have a written question that’s keyed to this
tape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">544</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I follow that, but he doesn’t have to go through the preliminary
explaining to me this because I’ll answer anything you want “off the
hook.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Ruby, we appreciate your willingness to do that and we’ll
take you up on that to the fullest extent possible, but Mr. Herndon has to do
some preliminary questioning which is indispensable to his evaluation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right, get him to minimize it if he can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. He will bear that in mind and minimize it to the fullest extent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Are you ready?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Then, these gentlemen actually will not be aware of the
questions, is that all right with you, I mean—prior to the time they leave? I
believe we discussed that previously and I did want to mention it, that it would
be so important when the questions would be asked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Not to me, Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I see—about your being aware of the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Mr. Specter, you recall, previously—one of the reasons I was
going over all the questions before actually conducting the examination was
in order for these gentlemen that are in attendance to be aware of what
questions are going to be asked Mr. Ruby during the actual polygraph examination.
Now, if we dispense with that before we go over these questions, if
they leave the room, they do not know the questions I’m going to ask him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. I don’t think Jack has any objection to us staying here at
this time, do you, Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I certainly don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Well, of course, I still have the same objection, and respectfully
request again, Jack, that we’re not trying to hide anything—don’t misunderstand
me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Just a minute—let me tell you something. I want to straighten up
some things. Whether he leaves the room or not, Mr. Alexander is going to
know everything that went on here, so please concede to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Well, I’ll concede to this, that at sometime he will know, but
I’m saying this—that perhaps there might be something, Jack, that might in
some way be to your detriment if Mr. Alexander knew the answer to the question
at this time. Now, he may say “No,” but I still, as your attorney and in
trying to protect your rights, insist that it be handled in this way, and I would
certainly appreciate your cooperation with me to that extent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The only reason I want Mr. Alexander here, I want him to know
my effectiveness when I answer the questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Jack, that’s very well, and I don’t think he has any doubt that
you’re trying to hide it and all of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then, let us proceed as we have before, with Mr. Herndon
announcing the questions in advance but going through a minimum amount of
preliminaries so that he is satisfied that he can evaluate the results.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And we will proceed on that basis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You can run through them a lot faster and I’ll grasp them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right; I will proceed in that manner and also with the
questions we have already set forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; and then we’ll supplement them to cover the additional
topics which have not yet been included.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, Mr. Ruby, do you feel all right to continue with this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I am ready.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Very fine. I will hook this up and go over these questions and
I’ll just read them out to you and you just speak up if there is one you want
to rephrase.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you see the armored truck before you went to the basement?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you enter the police department through a door at the rear
on the east side of the jail?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">545</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “After talking to Little Lynn, did you hear any
announcement that Oswald was about to be moved?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Before you left your apartment Sunday morning, did anyone
tell you the armored car was on the way to the police department?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Those are your main questions, and I will ask you some of these
other routine questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right; go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Do you have any brothers?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Do you have any sisters?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Have you answered all questions truthfully?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Now, here’s a question I want to go over with you very carefully.
“Did you ever hit anyone with any kind of weapon?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right; I’ll give you an opportunity now to explain that to
me. This is for my purposes of the examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, in running a—in my business, when you get somebody with
a—it’s a very exciting business. One particular night a man pulled a knife on
me and I took a pistol and hit him on the head in that altercation, and sometimes
you get fellows with real bad rough reputations. They’re real toughs. There’s
no question about it, and being in my type of business for a livelihood, the only
way you can—of course, I do call the law enforcement officers. At that particular
moment, it’s my life or theirs, and some of these men are pretty powerful
physically, and I fought in every way possible, with my fists and everything else—but
to minimize the various troubles I had, where there would be an altercation
or something come up, I’d tell them to leave, and of course, something would
happen and they would go from here—whatever it is. It happened a few times
where I would pummel a few of these men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I understand, Mr. Ruby, but all of these incidents that you
recall are in connection with your operating this club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; they are at the club. These boys are real bad boys and they
all have records, and they’re pretty tough guys. Will you agree with something
on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Then, on the actual test. I’m going to ask you this question:
“Other than what you’ve told me, did you ever hit anyone with any kind of
weapon?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t follow—“Other than what you’ve told me?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. In other words, other than your being the owner of a nightclub,
which because of the type of customers you occasionally have, you would have
to use some force, perhaps hit a customer or hit someone in your club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Have you ever been involved in any other situation where you
actually struck at somebody with a weapon? “Weapon” here I’m referring to
as a gun, club, or knife or anything that would be other than just a normal fist-fight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; that happened, but that was before I got in this trouble. This
man threatened to kill me and was going to go for his gun, and I was nice enough
to have him stay at my place and he was causing a nuisance in the vicinity of
the club, causing brawls and all that and I tried to reprimand him, and a little
boy of Italian descent and very gracious, somehow he got very belligerent with
me, and I knew he had a car and he said, “I’m going to get my pistol,” and
there’s a funny reaction about that. Once they get you cowered to that extent,
then you’re doomed, and there’s a funny feeling, when I was with him, that you
have with them. So, I got my pistol and I cornered him and I called him by his
name and I called him a name, and I said, “You’re going to kill me, you so-and-<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">546</span>so?”
Finally he said, “I was only kidding, I was only kidding,” and there’s a
certain reaction you have and I can’t explain it. That’s the only time any crime
of that sort has ever happened outside of my business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Outside of your business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Then, if I asked you whether or not you told me you ever hit
anyone with any kind of weapon, unless something else comes up to your mind,
you would answer that “Yes”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, like if I was a goon or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes, a union goon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. A union goon. Right. I haven’t been a slugger or anything like
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, we can go along here Mr. Ruby, and I will hook up the
instrument.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 6:43 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Will you raise your arms, Mr. Ruby, please? Do you feel
comfortable?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Now, lean back. [Attached instruments to Mr. Ruby.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Have I been evading any of your questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You have been most cooperative—thus far no problems.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. But you can’t tell how I stand, can you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Mr. Ruby, I will want to take a considerable amount of time to
review these charts very thoroughly before I come to any conclusion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. How long would it take—how long will it take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Well, I can’t answer that question with a definite answer. It
depends on what I may run into when I study these very carefully back in
Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Bill, will I still be around when the answers come back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Raise your right hand and give him your word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Chief, you heard him, did you not, Chief? [Addressing the Chief
Jailer Holman.] You and I should live so long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Is that comfortable, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Now, I’m not going to ask the questions at this time, I’m just
going to readjust the instruments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Let’s go, Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let the record show that Mr. Alexander and Mr. Tonahill have
left the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Do you want to cough, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You want me to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(Mr. Ruby coughed at this time.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, are you about ready to begin with this one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Once again, just repeating instructions, if you will uncross your
legs, sir, and put your feet flat on the floor and look straight ahead and answer
the questions truthfully “Yes” or “No.”</p>

<p>This will be series No. 5. I will let you know when the test will begin. Is
there a little pressure on the arm cuff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Now, Mr. Ruby, look straight ahead. That’s fine. Now, just
look straight ahead and try not to move, and the test will begin.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 6:45 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Is your last name Ruby?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you see the armored car before it entered the basement?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Do you have any brothers?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">547</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you enter the police department through a door at the rear
on the east side of the jail?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Do you have any sisters?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “After talking to Little Lynn did you hear any announcement
that Oswald was about to be moved?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Other than what you’ve told me, did you ever hit anyone with
any kind of weapon?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know how to answer that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, just sit still and relax, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Ask me that again—I got the answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Other than what you’ve told me, did you ever hit anyone
with any kind of weapon?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Before you left your apartment Sunday morning, did anyone
tell you the armored car was on the way to the police department?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Have you answered all questions truthfully?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, that test is over. Just sit still for a moment, and I
will now release the pressure on your arm. You can move you left arm and
relax.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 6:50 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I’m sorry if I gave you any problem on that question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, because it threw me off again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, we’ll just go over it again as a matter of record. I
asked you there, “Other than what you’ve told me, did you ever hit anyone with
any kind of weapon,” and you explained that at two different times and that
once it was in the club with some people and customers, and another time it was
outside the club, and when we bring out other than those, was there any other
time you hit anybody with a weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You don’t recall any other time, is that correct, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes. I thought I said two of them—and I thought it meant with my
fists.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Well, I meant with a weapon, when you actually hit someone
with an implement in your hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You thought I was feminine, didn’t you, Chief? Why did you
lock me up in that tank? [Addressing Chief Jailer Holman.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Mr. Ruby, when I asked you, “Do you have any sisters?” I
asked that in the plural—you have more than one sister?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You have several sisters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. How many sisters do you have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Did anything in particular come to your mind when I asked
you that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No—not like that other question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. What question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The one about “Have you ever been married?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes, I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Do I sound like a man with an unsound mind to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. As I said before, Mr. Ruby, I’m not qualified to answer that
question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh—oh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You have been cooperative as far as answering my questions
and proceeding with the examination.</p>

<p>(At this point Mr. Specter left the room and shortly thereafter Messrs.
Alexander and Tonahill returned to the room.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">548</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. We can proceed and move pretty fast as soon as Mr. Specter
comes back. Just sit and relax. Would you like me to take any of these things
off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Are you comfortable?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You’re not going to ask me any more questions? Do you want to
go through that stuff there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I think I had better wait for Mr. Specter to be here. I don’t
want to proceed without him. Can I get you a drink of water?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No. Can we talk about certain things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I suggest you wait until Mr. Specter returns.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Is there anything on your mind, Bill, off the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. I think with that Cuban thing cleared up and with an opportunity
to answer a question on <span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. How about the underworld?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Well, he’s going to ask you that, if he hasn’t already.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. There were a lot of phone calls, as you recall. I’m sure you
know that and there should be a specific way to ask me—“What was the purpose
of all those calls?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Well, you see, that wouldn’t record on the machine. The
question would have to be, “Did any telephone calls have any connection with
the shooting of Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, but still, when you have so many calls, you still want to know
why you called people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Well, all your telephone calls were either business or personal,
weren’t they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s right, and the other question you asked about Oswald—you
know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. “Did any of these calls have any connection with the shooting
of Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No. How about my trip to Havana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Has that been asked yet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That hasn’t been asked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. “Did your trip to Havana have any connection with the
shooting of Oswald, however remote?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Have I ever had any business dealings—I want them to know my
relationship.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. “Have you ever had any political or business connection with
Castro or Cuba?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s a good question. Or, why did I make that trip to Havana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. “Was your trip to Havana personal or business?” I think
that’s overlapping that Cuban deal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, but here’s the thing. When people ask me—they say, “Jack,
you went to Havana, Cuba” and I say, “I went there for a vacation.” They say,
“How long did you stay?” When I say, “8 days,”—you somehow have got to
answer specifically that it was a vacation, because a person can be very evasive
and say he went for a vacation but yet had other dealings there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. “Was your trip to Havana purely for vacation and pleasure?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Jack, my memory is just vague—you’ve never been to Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I never have been to Mexico, but Bill, you know a lot of questions
to ask me, I’m sure you know, that I’d like to get cleared up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Well, you never have been interested in politics, as far as I
know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. What I was doing down at that News Building—what was I doing
down there Friday—I want that question asked.</p>

<p>(At this point Mr. Specter returned to the room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. That’s kind of a belabored question, Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Joe, you don’t believe that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Court Reporter.</span> I want to be sure I heard Mr. Ruby’s answer to Mr. Alexander’s
question a little while ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You want to hear that again?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">549</span>
<span class="smcap">Court Reporter.</span> I didn’t quite hear your answer to Mr. Alexander’s question,
“Did any of these calls have any connection with the shooting of Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, you’re taking down what I’m saying? I didn’t know you were
taking that down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; we’re taking everything down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh—well, give me the question again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Court Reporter.</span> This was when Mr. Alexander asked you, “Did any of these
calls have any connection with the shooting of Oswald?” and what was your
answer to that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Court Reporter.</span> Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Are you putting down the questions I’ve been asking myself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Court Reporter.</span> Yes; everything you’ve been saying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Voluntarily—correct?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Court Reporter.</span> Oh, yes. Just like you say them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We are putting it down in the record, Mr. Ruby, just like you’re
saying it.</p>

<p>Odell, can you bring me up-to-date, I’ve been out of the room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Court Reporter.</span> Mr. Alexander has been asking him certain questions that
might be asked <span class="locked">about——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. About that Havana, Cuba trip.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Court Reporter.</span> And had he been to Mexico, and had he been in politics, and
Mr. Alexander said to his knowledge he had not been interested in politics, and
the purpose of his trip to Cuba, whether it was for business or pleasure, and I
believe that is what was covered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The most important question—you haven’t asked me yet—why
did I shoot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Jack, they can’t ask that kind of question for this machine.
They can only ask you—was it for a certain purpose. It has to be a “Yes”
or “No” answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The point is—if I was carried away emotionally, and because I felt
that, it sounds so unbelievable. Why shouldn’t I be asked a question—why—what
motivated me to do it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Ruby, answer now the question, “Why did you shoot Oswald?”
and then we will turn that around into a question to ask you for a “Yes”
or “No” answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. At the particular moment, after watching television all <span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Jack, let me interject right now, again, as your attorney—I
advise you not to answer this question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Clayton, I’m sorry, I’ve got to answer it. I’ve got to, because,
believe me, it means an awful lot to me. I didn’t want—I felt so carried
away—that at that particular time of the great tragedy, I felt somehow in my
little bit of a way I could save Mrs. Kennedy the ordeal of coming back for
trial here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right, fine, Mr. Ruby. That’s the same answer to that general
question that you gave when the Commission heard your testimony, and
we shall phrase that in an appropriate question for the polygraph examination.
Now, will you proceed, Mr. Herndon, with our next series, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Do you want me to rehearse the ones that are prepared?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; just our prepared series, and we will take these in a sequence
and we will cover everything else later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, I’ll go over these for you again, Mr. Ruby, so that
you understand the intent of the question and what it means.</p>

<p>“Did you get a Wall Street Journal at Southwestern Drug Store during the
week before the assassination?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Was the Wall Street Journal addressed to a Mr. Bradshaw?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Well, that one, we’re going to have to rephrase. “Do you know
if the Wall Street Journal was addressed to Mr. Bradshaw?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">550</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I haven’t read a Wall Street Journal in the longest time—in
years, probably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Do you wish to keep that question in, Mr. Specter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Jack, was there a man named Bradshaw, your landlord?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; Houston Nichols was my landlord, but I know a Bradshaw.
He used to be in the pinball game machine business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. A jukebox man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; everybody knows him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is his first name, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know, but he owned a liquor store and he’s a pretty successful
businessman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was a Wall Street Journal addressed to Mr. J. E. Bradshaw,
dated November 16, 1963, in your car at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever heard of any such Wall Street Journal having
been found in your car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We will rephrase that question too. Let’s try this: “Do you
have any knowledge of a Wall Street Journal addressed to Mr. J. E. Bradshaw
being found in your car?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; did they find one somewhere in my car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Proceed, please, Mr. Herndon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you or any of your friends telephone the FBI in Dallas
between 2 or 3 a.m. Sunday morning?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. How could I—I was incarcerated? Oh, Sunday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Some people might refer to that as Saturday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know. I know I went to bed about 1:30, so I can’t answer
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Make that “To your <span class="locked">knowledge”——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. “To your knowledge, did any of your friends”—do so and so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I think in that way you should be able to answer “Yes” or “No”.</p>

<p>“Did you or any of your friends telephone the sheriff’s office between 2 or 3
a.m. Sunday morning?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Again, I can rephrase that—“To your knowledge—” if you
wish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Make it—“Did you or any of your friends, to your knowledge,
phone the sheriff’s office?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. And then, some of these questions I will ask you again here,
such as, “Did you previously live in San Francisco?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I understand you did.</p>

<p>I’m going to ask you this question, which will help me, and that is, “In your
dealings, Mr. Ruby, as a nightclub operator, at any time have you ever overcharged
a customer?” I assume there are some times when you probably are
at the cash register, is that correct, and you are handling the transaction of
money with customers or with the bills.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You understand what I mean by “overcharge”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. We have a very lucrative business in champagne there, the kind of
business that—Bill Alexander knows about it—they get merchandise received
for what they get. It’s quite lucrative and that’s one way you can survive,
I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I’ll just simply ask the question, “Did you ever overcharge a
customer?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I’ll probably ask you questions for your identity, like “Is your
name Jack Ruby?” at the beginning of these series.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Let’s see, gentlemen, I believe we’ve gone over all these questions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">551</span>
and I’m going to ask you also as a matter of record on the test—are you
tired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; as a matter of fact, I’m feeling my best right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You feel all right.</p>

<p>Those are the questions we’re going to ask.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 7:05 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let the record show that Mr. Alexander and Mr. Tonahill left
the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, Mr. Ruby, I’ll get this machine to going again, and
we will get started on series No. 6. Mr. Ruby, could you sit up a little straighter?
When you slouch over like that, I’m not getting the tracing I want on the
reading. Now, that’s much better. [At this time Mr. Herndon snapped his
fingers.] Look straight ahead again, Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I will let you know when I’m going to start the test, and if
you will answer the questions again, simply and truthfully, “Yes” or “No.”</p>

<p>If I come to any one of these that you feel like you are not sure how to answer
it and you don’t want to answer it “Yes” or “No,” once again just refrain from
talking and we will discuss the question at the end of the series.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right. I’ll remain silent, huh?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes; remain silent.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 7:08 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The test will now begin.</p>

<p>“Is your name Jack Ruby?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you get a Wall Street Journal at the Southwestern Drug
Store during the week before the assassination?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Are you tired?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Do you have any knowledge of a Wall Street Journal addressed
to Mr. J. E. Bradshaw?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you previously live in San Francisco?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “To your knowledge, did any of your friends or did you
telephone the FBI in Dallas between 2 or 3 a.m. Sunday morning?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you ever overcharge a customer?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you or any of your friends to your knowledge telephone
the sheriff’s office between 2 or 3 a.m. Sunday morning.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I think that series is over and I will release the pressure.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 7:10 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Are they that important—those questions? I know more important
ones than that. Of course—I’m kidding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. We have some more coming.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruby, has a customer by any chance ever claimed that they were
overcharged at your place? Have you ever had any problems along that line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes—we have problems with waitresses and big bills.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Other than what you told us about the Wall Street Journal,
is there anything else that came to your mind with regard to this Wall Street
Journal question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. As a matter of fact, the question you asked me is so foreign to
<span class="locked">me——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. In other words, you are completely unaware of the Wall Street
Journal situation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know how it ever came to be there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That completes that series.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 7:12 p.m.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">552</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let the record show that Mr. Tonahill and Mr. Alexander
returned to the room.</p>

<p>Would you now proceed, Mr. Herndon, to the next series, and we’ll go through
those as rapidly as you can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Mr. Ruby. I’ll just read these right down the line, and if you
have any question, then interrupt me. Otherwise, I’ll just keep going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Do you intend to answer the questions truthfully?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span> (no response).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you go to the Dallas police station at any time on Friday,
November 22, 1963, before you went to the synagogue?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Do you attend the synagogue regularly?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No—not of late, because of my businesses and my sister was ill
and I had to help at both places—I had to run both places.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, If you feel it is proper, you can answer that question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. This was a special occasion, this Friday night—I wanted to go
there because of this tragedy happening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Very fine. The way I mean that question is—do you attend
the synagogue regularly and at every usual service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, yes—on high holidays and when my father passed away,
I went there consistently for 11 months; morning and evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you go to the synagogue that Friday night?” Now,
“that Friday night”—you know the night we’re talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Friday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The night of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I’m going to ask you this question—it’s simple and short:
“Do you pray?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Not now, because it’s hopeless. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You can answer it “Yes” or “No” when the question comes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Pardon me—I take it back—I do pray. I say certain prayers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you see Oswald in the Dallas jail on a Friday night?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Were you at one time employed by a union?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you have a gun with you when you went to the Friday
midnight press conference?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Let’s have that again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you have a gun with you when you went to the Friday
midnight press conference?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You mean at the police station? No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Just so we have it clear—what we mean here <span class="locked">is——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You mean in my possession?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you insert in there—“at the jail”—“did you have a gun
with you when you went to the Friday midnight press conference at the jail?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. If you put it in his car or on his person, I think he can
answer it better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No—because I recall when I first said I did, and then I changed it
later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Mr. Ruby, so you understand what I mean when I say “Did
you have a gun with you?” I mean on the person.</p>

<p>I’m going to ask this question which one of the gentlemen recommended, and it
is, “Have you told the Warren Commission the entire truth?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; and I may have left out certain things because I was a
little—I wasn’t as calm as I am now, so in reality, certain things I could have
said, I’m sure in my frame of mind now I would be able to do it better, but I
told the truth at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Perhaps we could rephrase it and say, “Is everything you told
the Warren Commission the truth?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I can say that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">553</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The question will be then, as Mr. Specter put it, “Is everything
you told the Warren Commission the entire truth?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Any questions, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Fine; I will proceed.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 7:15 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. For the record, this will be series No. 7.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Alexander and Mr. Tonahill have now left the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I wonder why Mr. Tonahill is here. He’s not my attorney. Clayton,
is Joe Tonahill representing me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Well Jack, in some capacity, I think he is still involved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well—yes and no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. But please don’t worry about it at this time. He is here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Mr. Ruby, do you mind if I tighten the rubber tube on your
chest just a slight bit more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Make it as tight as you want it. I want to get it right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. No; I don’t want to make it too tight, I want to make it
comfortable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span> (addressing Mr. Holman). Are you coming to work tomorrow?
I don’t know where you’ll find me. How about you, chief?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, now just breathe naturally and sit up a little bit
straighter. That’s good. That’s fine, Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 7:15 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Just relax. [At this point Mr. Herndon snapped his fingers
twice.]</p>

<p>I will tell you once again when the test will begin. Answer the questions
truthfully “Yes” or “No.” Try to sit perfectly relaxed and try not to move.
Look straight ahead, if you will, Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>Did you just have a gas pain or something trouble you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, relax. We will now begin.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 7:18 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Do you intend to answer these questions truthfully?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes; I do.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Just answer the questions “Yes” or “No,” please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. OK.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you go to the Dallas police station at any time on Friday,
November 22, 1963, before you went to the synagogue?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Do you attend the synagogue regularly?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. How can I answer that one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Just relax. “Did you go to the synagogue that Friday night?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Do you pray?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you see Oswald in the Dallas jail on Friday night?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Were you at one time employed by a union?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you have a gun with you when you went to the Friday
midnight press conference at the jail?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Is everything you told the Warren Commission the entire
truth?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That series is over. Just sit still for a moment, Mr. Ruby, and
I will release the pressure on your arm, and you may now move.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 7:21 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. At the beginning of that series, Mr. Ruby, you displayed a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">554</span>
little nervousness and a little tension. Perhaps it was the question I asked with
regard to the synagogue. Did that upset you in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Because—you’re ashamed to admit you haven’t been going regular—yet,
you don’t want to come out with a blunt answer “No”—it makes you
sort of an atheist, and I didn’t want to answer it that way, but I do go to the
high holidays, but going regular and going to the high holidays are two different
ways of going. People that go regular go every Friday night and pretty
regular during the week, but my hours were entirely different. I mean—I’m
trying to explain that to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes; that’s what I want you to do. Go ahead, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I could say “Yes” and I would be lying to you saying “Yes”.
Anyway, the last couple of years—the last year and a half or 2 years have been
very tough to me businesswise and I’ve stayed pretty close, outside the high
holidays.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Did that question disturb you in any regard when I asked,
“Did you go to the Dallas police station at any time on Friday——”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Before you went to the synagogue?” You did show some
reaction, will you tell me that, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Because I knew that some man in the trial said I did come down
there, and naturally, that came flashing into my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Was this some man at the trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Did he testify?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; Mr. John Rutledge. He said I was down there earlier, when I
wasn’t—and the association of this man came to my mind. Can you ask me
that over again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I don’t think I have to, Mr. Ruby. I wanted to get your explanation
of why. Did you feel a reaction to that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; because it’s like the Wall Street Journal question—when you
asked me that. I get nervous too. When they said they found it in my car,
there must be some reason that it was found in my car, when I know I never
did see this particular paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Well, at this trial Mr. John Rutledge’s testimony conflicted
with what you had said, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Not what he said, Mr. Herndon. He didn’t testify.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He testified emphatically—it looked like I was trying to find out
who this Oswald was, and if I went down there more than once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I see. You did feel the reaction on that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I think we can proceed on to the next series.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We’re now at series 8, correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The next series will be 8, correct.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 7:23 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let the record show that Mr. Alexander and Mr. Tonahill have
returned now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Are you all right, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. We shall continue, and these are questions we want to put to
you for this next series.</p>

<p>“Have you ever knowingly attended any meetings of the Communist Party
or any other group that advocates violent overthrow of the Government?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Now, is that question too long for you to answer it clearly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Of course, there are two parts there—the Communist Party
or any other group that advocates the violent overthrow of the Government—do
you understand the question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; very much so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. And then I will ask you, “Did you legally change your last
name?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">555</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I’m going to ask you again at the beginning of the test, “Is
your last name Ruby?” I’m going to ask, “Do you know if any of your immediate
family or any close friend is a member of the Communist Party?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Were you in the Army Air Corps?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Do you know if any of your immediate family or any close
friend is a member of any group that advocates the violent overthrow of the
Government?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let’s rephrase those, Mr. Herndon. “To your knowledge, is
any member of your family——”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Rather than “Do you know——”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Why don’t you put it stronger—ask me the question without—to
my knowledge—the answer is “No”. When you say—to my knowledge—you
leave an opening there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Say—“Is any member of your family a <span class="locked">member”——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We will take that and make it categorical—without the prefix.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In other words, I don’t want any opening for any doubt that there
is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Both those questions I started, “Do you know,”—I’m going to
just start the question—“Is any member of your family”—et cetera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Is that all right with you, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No, no; emphatically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Here again, “Is any close friend or any member of your immediate
family,”—I will have to change this one. I shall ask the question this
way, unless you have reason to object. “Do you know if any close friend or any
member of your immediate family ever attended a meeting of the Communist
Party?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In other words, if I say I know they <span class="locked">did——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Do you have knowledge, in other words?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; not knowledge—you’re putting me in a spot there. Repeat
it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Let me ask this question the way I composed it originally.
“Do you know if any close friend or any member of your immediate family ever
attended a meeting of the Communist Party?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes. Meaning—I know they didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That’s a very valid point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let’s rephrase it then—“Did any member of your immediate
family or any close friend ever attend a meeting of the Communist Party?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. How do you want that, Mr. Specter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. “Did any member of your immediate family or any close friend
ever attend a meeting of the Communist Party?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I just had it slightly different. “Did any close friend or any
member of your immediate family ever attend a meeting of the Communist
Party?” Is that all right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That phraseology is satisfactory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Now, there’s one other question here and this one is a little
bit long, and we might want to discuss this question so Mr. Ruby will understand
it perfectly. “Do you know if any close friend or any member of your
immediate family has ever attended a meeting of any group that advocates the
violent overthrow of the Government?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I know that they didn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let’s rephrase the question, leaving out the “Do you <span class="locked">know”——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. So that it will now be, “Did any—et cetera.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, the question will read: “Did any close friend or any
member of your immediate family ever attend a meeting of any group that advocates
the violent overthrow of the Government?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">556</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Those are the questions, unless Mr. Ruby has some question
on them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let the record show that Mr. Tonahill and Mr. Alexander are
now out of the room and we may proceed with this series.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note. 7:28 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. For the record, this is series No. 8.</p>

<p>All right, Mr. Ruby, I shall now put some pressure in the arm cuff and if
you will look straight ahead, sir, and answer the questions truthfully “Yes” or
“No,” and I will tell you when I am going to begin asking questions.</p>

<p>The test will now begin.</p>

<p>“Is your last name Ruby?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Have you ever knowingly attended any meetings of the Communist
Party or any other group that advocates violent overthrow of the Government?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you legally change your last name?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Is any member of your immediate family or any close friend,
a member of the Communist Party?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Were you in the Army Air Corps?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Is any member of your immediate family or any close friend a
member of any group that advocates the violent overthrow of the Government?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Look straight ahead, please, sir. “Did any close friend or any
member of your immediate family ever attend a meeting of the Communist
Party?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did any close friend or any member of your immediate family
ever attend a meeting of any group that advocates the violent overthrow of the
Government?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That series is over. If you will relax, Mr. Ruby, I will release
the pressure on your arm.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 7:33 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I know these questions were a little long, but I feel that you got
the intent of them all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Sure; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That will complete series No. 8.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let the record show that we are now going to take a very short
recess, and resume in just a few moments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Would you like to take this off just a minute and stand up a
little bit, unless you prefer me to leave it on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: Recess began 7:33 p.m. During the recess Mr. Fowler and
Mr. Ruby conferred out of the hearing of all in the room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. It is now 7:55 p.m. and may the record show that we have taken
a 20-minute recess and have now reconvened for the last session.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You’re not going to ask about the phone calls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Those are going to be covered, Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I know you are for me, Joe, I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let us proceed at this point, Mr. Herndon, with the next series of
questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Are you tired, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Do you feel all right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. We shall then continue. I’m going to read off a good number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">557</span>
of questions here, and I’m going to ask them in a series called 9 and a series
called 9a.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. And I’m not going to interject any of these other minor questions.
These are all direct questions and I want to make sure that you understand
what they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you ever meet Oswald at your post office box?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you use your post office mailbox to do any business with
Mexico or Cuba?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No. Pardon me—why don’t you say, “Did you ever meet him at
the post office or at the club?” Wouldn’t that be good too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We have asked you if you ever knew him before, and now we’re
focusing on this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh—“How many times did he come up to the club?”—that’s something
else. Also, somebody said that they saw Tippit, I, this Mr. Lane stated
that he saw Tippit, myself, and Oswald at the club—so go ahead, I don’t want
to throw you off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, we will add a question there at that point, such as this:
“Did you ever meet with Officer Tippit and Oswald at your club?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Do you want that “Oswald and” or “or”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; we do. Use “and.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The first thing about that post office box—how do we know whether
it’s really authentic or the man had the box there or not? It could have been
placed there at a later date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. It was right, Jack. He had it. I saw the key myself and it
had “X” number on the box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. How come it never come out before then? Why didn’t it come out
still before that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. It did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; it didn’t come out until a long time—until just recently. It
just came out about a week ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. They just didn’t feature it—it was just overlooked. I saw the
key that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. But Bill, I know one thing—I know that box could have been purchased
at a later date, after Oswald’s death and could make it look like it’s close
to mine; I know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, the situation there isn’t really directly germane here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. It looks very bad for me, though, I know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. No; Jack, I saw the key Friday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We will cover the subject matter here, so you will have a chance
under the polygraph examination to cover it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You probably saw the key, but I know the affiliation with the Government,
that you can always get a box at a later date, if you wanted to do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Jack, on Friday night that key was photographed, inventoried,
<span class="locked">and——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. What Friday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. The Friday night of the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You mean it was known—the number of the box—that Friday
night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Yes, sir; sure was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Did the public know about it and everybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. I’m sure they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right; go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I will proceed, Mr. Ruby. “Did you do business with Castro
Cuba?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Was your trip to Cuba solely for pleasure?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you keep $2,200 in cash on you because you didn’t have a
chance to get to the bank?” Is that question clear?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">558</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Let me go off the record. This is going to be ad libbing, Miss, so
can you hold it off on this? Can you hold it off or do you have to put it down?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Court Reporter.</span> Mr. Ruby, you have to ask that man over there—Mr. Specter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you want to go off the record, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right, off the record at this point.</p>

<p>(Explanation by Mr. Ruby at this point regarding the $2,200 cash item
previously mentioned—off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Back on the record. Mr. Ruby, that’s a perfectly good explanation,
and I think it would be better if we put that on the record as to this
point, if it’s all right with you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; but it’s too crazy, mixed up, the way I was saying it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, essentially what you’re saying makes good sense. What
you’re saying is that you don’t want to have it in a condition where somebody
can levy on it and get ahold of it before your creditors got it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well. I had the total cash for both clubs, but then, this was Friday
night. Now, knowing my payroll at the Carousel runs to $1,600 or $1,400 on
a Sunday night, and the Vegas Club on Saturday night because we close Sunday,
consequently that money would be absorbed completely in another night
or two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Ruby, that makes good sense. I think that in view of what
your answer has been, it is preferable for us to put it on the record rather than
to have any suggestion that anything that has been off the record is in anyway
damaging or that we’re keeping anything off the record that ought to be on the
record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Do you want me to go through that again, now? Do you want me
to go through what I said to you now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That’s right. Now, Miss Odell Oliver, will you go on the record
with Mr. Ruby now, and since Mr. Ruby has made a brief explanation with
regard to the last question, and at my suggestion he is willing to put it on the
record, and he will now repeat the substance of what he has previously said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right. Due to my sister being ill and away from running the
Vegas Club, I had in my possession for both clubs for operation, for payrolls
and everything else, et cetera, et cetera.</p>

<p>Just a week prior to that I had purchased a safe which I knew it was necessary
to have, and we already had—my maintenanceman had built the forms for
the safe, and we wanted further information as to where to place this safe in
the club where it would be safest where burglars couldn’t get at it. We called
a Mr. Joe Cody of the police department to advise us where to place the thing.
Consequently the safe had not been placed in cement as yet, and I had been
carrying the total amount of cash for both clubs, the total capital, which include
my purchases if there were to be any made, and the payroll for both
clubs, and any accumulated excise tax money from the beginning of the last
quarter for both clubs. So, hence, that money belonged solely to the operation
of the Vegas Club and the Carousel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Ruby, then we will rephrase that question to this and simply
state—“Have you now told the truth about why you carried $2,200 in cash?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; but you have a reason for asking me that—whether that was
somebody else’s money or something—yes. All that money is specifically in
relationship to the operation of both clubs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, we could rephrase it, “Have you now told the truth concerning
why you carried around $2,200 in cash?” and we will cover the substance
of the matter in that question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In other words, you don’t want to leave it in your apartment because
somebody might break in, but you feel it’s safe, especially if I’m armed
anyway, not that I can handle a gun that well, or whatever it may be, but somehow
you feel—it’s true I had the safe installed because I thought that would be
safer to put any of my possessions in. In other words, it’s a cash operation. In
other words, $2,200 in one week is a good return anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I’ll proceed, Mr. Ruby, if you are ready?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">559</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did any foreign influence cause you to shoot Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you shoot Oswald because of any influence of the underworld?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, by the word “foreign” in those questions, Mr. Ruby, we intend
to convey to you—by Russia, by Cuba, or by any other foreign government, so
that you may understand the full import of that question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No—but the whole thing was based on—when was the first time
you thought of it—in other words, that Sunday morning, so in other words—well,
we’ll get to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “No” is the answer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you shoot Oswald because of a labor union influence?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I will now rephrase that, if I may. “Did you shoot Oswald
because of labor union influence?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did any long-distance telephone calls which you made before
the assassination of the President have anything to do with the assassination?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did any of your long-distance telephone calls concern the
shooting of Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you shoot Oswald in order to save Mrs. Kennedy the ordeal
of a trial?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you know Officer Tippit?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. This is off the record for a minute, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Ruby, I think it would be unwise for us to go off the record
on this question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, all right. There were three Officer Tippits in the police
department. I only knew one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that Officer J. D. Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. He’s the one who was slain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes—Officer J. D. Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I don’t think he was the one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you know Officer Tippit who was slain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I don’t know him. You see, I know so many officers and there
are three Tippits, but I know one Tippit, and which one that is—if I would see
him personally and see his physical features and knowing him—of course, I
didn’t have time to—I was incarcerated too soon to find out. Actually, the Tippit
I knew, who worked at special service in the police department—you know which
one I’m talking about, Bill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Yes; but that’s not the one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know this Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. This boy had always been a radio patrolman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I don’t know that I had ever seen this fellow before—I had
never seen him before. I may have seen him before but I didn’t know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Mr. Ruby, if I ask a question, “Did you know the Officer Tippit
slain?” Can you reasonably answer that truthfully “Yes” or “No”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I mean—you can answer it without any problem mentally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; that’s what I mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To state it differently, you are able to answer whether or not
you knew Officer J. D. Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I can’t answer “Yes” or “No” and say whether or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, I want to be sure that your last answer is responsive so
that we are clear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, I gave the answer “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Let’s put it this way—“Did you know the Tippit that was
killed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">560</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Repeat that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you know the Tippit that was killed?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you tell the truth about relaying the message to Ray
Brantley to get McWillie a few guns?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you come out of the assembly room on Friday night to
get the telephone number of KLIF?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Not come out of the assembly room—I went to the assembly room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you go to the assembly room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On Friday night—in order to get the telephone number of KLIF?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, we want to make that clear. We want to make that
correction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Did you know that was part of my story, did you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The question will be worded, Mr. Ruby, “Did you go to the assembly
room on Friday night to get the telephone number of KLIF?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That’s clear and concise for you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you ever meet with Oswald and Officer Tippit at your
apartment?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Here again the Officer Tippit is the one we’re talking about that
was killed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, Mr. Ruby, those are the questions and we will proceed
on those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Fine. Let’s proceed with this series.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. What was that last question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you ever meet with Oswald and Officer Tippit at your
apartment?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let the record show that Mr. Alexander and Mr. Tonahill have left
the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Do you feel all right now, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Are you tired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 8:10 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, we can continue. If we may do so, we can save a
little time, I’ll go ahead and ask you about seven or eight questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. And I’ll just stop so that I can let the pressure off your arm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Don’t worry about me. I’m in good shape. The point is—I want
to get as much in as we can. I don’t want you to miss anything, because there’s
a lot of pertinent stuff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, Mr. Ruby, if you will sit back a little bit higher, and
if you will uncross your legs. Take a deep breath.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. And relax and exhale.</p>

<p>For the record, this will be series 9. If you will look straight ahead and
answer these questions truthfully “Yes” or “No.” We will now begin.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 8:12 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you ever meet Oswald at your post office box?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you use your post office mailbox to do any business with
Mexico or Cuba?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you do business with Castro-Cuba?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Was your trip to Cuba solely for pleasure?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">561</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Have you now told us the truth concerning why you carried
$2,200 in cash on you?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did any foreign influence cause you to shoot Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you shoot Oswald because of any influence of the underworld?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I’m going to stop here a moment, sir, and release the pressure
on your arm and you just relax for a moment. Then I shall begin again in a
moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 8:15 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Just relax, Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>Does your arm feel all right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Fine—I’m all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I will continue this next series of questions and it will be listed as
series 9a.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 8:17 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. We will begin again.</p>

<p>“Did you shoot Oswald because of a labor union influence?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did any long-distance telephone calls which you made before
the assassination of the President have anything to do with the assassination?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did any of your long-distance telephone calls concern the
shooting of Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you shoot Oswald in order to save Mrs. Kennedy the
ordeal of a trial?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you know the Tippit that was killed?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you tell the truth about relaying the message to Ray
Brantley to get McWillie a few guns?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you go to the assembly room on Friday night to get the
telephone number of KLIF?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you ever meet with Oswald and Officer Tippit at your
club?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That completes that series. I will release that pressure and
you can now relax.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 8:20 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You seem to be relaxed and feeling fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you ready, Mr. Herndon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes; that completes that series.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Tonahill and Mr. Alexander have returned to the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Shall I go right into the next series?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Go right into the series. We just did series 9 and 9a, and we
are now going to series 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes; we just have a few more questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s wonderful, except there are a few things that I think you’ve
left out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, Mr. Ruby. If you have additional questions you want
asked, we will do our best to cover anything additional when we finish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Here are the next questions which I would like to ask you,
Mr. Ruby, on the next series. Again, I want to make sure that you understand
each and every one of them.</p>

<p>“Were you at the Parkland Hospital at any time on Friday?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">562</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you say anything at the time you shot Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Have any members of your family been physically harmed
because of what you did?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Not up to this point; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Then, the question can be answered in your mind either “Yes”
or “No”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You can answer it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Do you think members of your family are now in danger because
of what you did?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Is Mr. Fowler in danger because he is defending you?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did ‘Blackie’ Harrison speak to you just before you shot
Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I don’t know—so, I’ll say “No.” Oh, I see what you mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did ‘Blackie’ Harrison speak to <span class="locked">you”——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Just before you shot Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I realize this is based on your recollection, but if you feel
you can answer it “Yes” or “No,” fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The trouble is I didn’t hear any sounds of voices—then, I’ve got
to say “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. It’s your recollection you don’t recall Blackie Harrison speaking
to you just before you shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Ruby, you answered the question “Yes.” Did you say something
immediately before you shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I was going to ask that on here and then ask him about that
again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; but I would like to cover it in advance. What did you say
to Oswald, if you don’t mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I said, “You killed my President, you rat”—something like that.
“You killed my” or “our President, you rat.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I would like then to modify that question, Mr. Herndon. “Did
you say anything to Oswald immediately before shooting him, other than, ‘You
killed our President, you rat’”? If that’s not too long. I’d like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Well, just let me sit down and take a good look at that question.</p>

<p>(At this point there was a conference between Messrs. Specter, Alexander,
and Herndon out of the hearing of others in the room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Herndon, would you now read the question to Mr. Ruby as we
have modified it after consultation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Mr. Ruby, the question will be this way: “Did you say anything
when you shot Oswald other than that what you testified about?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The testifying about was pertaining to those statements that
you’ve just told us here a few moments ago. Do you follow me there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. The statement I made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, I will proceed with the series again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let’s proceed with the series.</p>

<p>May the record show that Mr. Tonahill and Mr. Alexander have left the
room.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 8:25 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Are you ready to begin now, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, if you will uncross your legs and put your feet flat on
the floor, please, Mr. Ruby, and are you comfortable?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">563</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Will you look straight ahead during the actual asking of the
questions.</p>

<p>For the record, this is series No. 10.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 8:26 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I notice during the time—all the time I ask you questions, Mr.
Ruby, that you close your eyes. If that’s a way that you can concentrate,
that’s perfectly all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s why—if I were guilty of something or if I were trying to
evade something, certainly closing your eyes would be less advantageous for
you to cover up something. Do you follow me? In other words, closing your
eyes means that I do want to tell the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That’s what I want you to do—just concentrate on the question
alone and you have to make that decision whether you will answer it
“Yes” or “No”.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In other words, if I was trying to cover up anything, I wouldn’t
try to get more of a vision of what you’re trying to refer me to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, if you will look straight ahead now, and sit perfectly
still, we will begin, and I will let you know when we’re going to ask the
first question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In other words, I’m trying to be more emphatic with the truth
when I close my eyes—more than the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Would you put your complete left hand on that arm rest—that’s
it.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 8:27 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The test will now begin.</p>

<p>“Is your name Jack Ruby?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Were you at the Parkland Hospital at any time on Friday?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did you say anything when you shot Oswald other than what
you’ve testified about?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Have members of your family been physically harmed because
of what you did?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.” May I interrupt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Just sit perfectly still. We will discuss the questions later,
Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>“Do you think members of your family are now in danger because of what
you did?”</p>

<p>Mr. Ruby (no response).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Is Mr. Fowler in danger because he is defending you?”</p>

<p>Mr. Ruby (no response).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Did ‘Blackie’ Hanson speak to you just before you shot
Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That will conclude that series, and just sit still a moment,
Mr. Ruby, and I will let the pressure out. Now, as soon as I shut this off, we
will discuss these questions.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 8:30 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. On that series of questions, Mr. Ruby, you failed to respond
or answer one or two of these questions, which I’ll give you an opportunity
now to make any comment you wish to make about them.</p>

<p>Question No. 5, I asked, “Do you think members of your family are now in
danger because of what you did?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, they’re always exposed to it, so I don’t know how to answer
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. In other words, you felt it would be difficult for you to say
either “Yes” or “No”; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s right; the same way with Fowler. I know when he’s representing
me, he’s putting himself on the spot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wood</span>. Neither the court reporter nor I got the last name of “Blackie”—exactly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">564</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I believe I said “Harrison.” That’s the way I had it in my
notes, but perhaps you might have gotten the impression I said “Hanson.” You
knew who I was talking about, Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That’s the main thing that you knew exactly who I meant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I believe you said “Harrison.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ruby, are there any other questions which you would like to be covered
with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Excuse me, Mr. Specter, I have one more question here. For
my records—he did not respond to question No. 6. If you want, I can go over
that and we can discuss that question without any response.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. No; I’d like to discuss that. Mr. Tonahill and Mr. Alexander
have already returned to the room, and I would like to discuss that if it’s all
right with you here. Let the record show that we would like to cover that now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Mr. Ruby, on that last series, I asked a question, “Is Mr.
Fowler in danger because he is defending you?” You remained silent, which
is one of the instructions I gave you, if you so pleased to do. Would you at this
time indicate to me why you wanted to remain silent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Well, No. 1, this is quite a notorious thing, and don’t forget, it’s
just like I specified when Earl Warren was in danger, you know, so he is—in
other words, people have a dislike for me, and Mr. Fowler is trying to defend
me, and this won’t make him too popular a person—too well liked of a person,
I should say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Then, you just simply didn’t want to come out with a “Yes” or
“No” answer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; because I wouldn’t know how to answer that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. All right, Mr. Specter. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Ruby, do you now have any other questions which you
would like us to ask you on this polygraph examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; “At what time did I first think of wanting—when was the
first time it ever entered my mind that I wanted to commit this act?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You mean the shooting of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We asked you that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You did—because if anything prior to that—in other <span class="locked">words——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. No; we asked you that very carefully a number of ways and
one way was when Mr. Herndon asked you did you think of it on Friday, and
you said “No”; did you think of it on Saturday morning—“No”; did you think of
it on Saturday evening—“No”; on Sunday morning “Yes,”—so we’ve covered
that very thoroughly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Have I ever received any monies—we don’t need that, do we, for
subversive purposes or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I think we’ve covered that whole area very carefully.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Now, what about my being present in the News Building that
morning? Here—the assassination took place across the street from there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Ruby, I think we have covered that when we asked you if
you told the truth on your testimony before the President’s Commission, because
you went into that on June 7, and that isn’t nearly the central issue as the other
specific questions we have asked you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; but if I was in a conspiracy, wouldn’t it start off with that
point? Oh, yes; they didn’t ask me another question: “If I loved the President
so much, why wasn’t I at the parade?” Is that a very important question to ask?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We have considered those questions and that was when we
reviewed the transcript of your testimony, and quite frankly, we have rejected
them as being not important.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You have? I see. Now, isn’t it strange—now, I want to tell you
something that’s noticeable in this part of the country about the poll tax, and
there are a lot of other reasons, maybe. I’m reluctant to buy my poll tax in time,
and I don’t recall whether or not—is this all right to go in the record if I speak?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You may go on the record with any facet you think is important
for the Commission to know about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. And yet, it’s strange that perhaps I didn’t vote for President<span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">565</span>
Kennedy, or didn’t vote at all, that I should build up such a great affection
for him, when everything points against me. For instance, the parade issue
I referred to. How can I answer that and still show my sincerity or my feelings
and why I was carried away so emotionally to do something like that, that has
put me in such serious trouble?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Jack, there’s no way to put that on the machine other than
to ask you if you told the truth in your testimony; and that’s an opinion without
concrete facts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. But I don’t remember if I got all the testimony in when Warren
was here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You testify now as to anything you want to add and we can ask
you one question at the end and that will be “Have you told the truth in everything
you’ve said here today?” That one question will cover everything you
said, so that if any other phase comes to your mind now, let us hear about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. What I’m trying to bring out is this: It’s—and everyone was very
much surprised—why should I be carried away so emotionally to commit the
act, and yet knowing how I felt and knowing I know I’m telling the truth, how
can we bring that point out that I am not sincere in why I did it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We can bring that out with the one general question. Now, is
there any other topic you would like to testify about and have us check you on
your truthfulness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes—whether or not I was ever mixed up with the underworld here
or involved in any crime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You’ve been asked that specifically, and you’ve testified about
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes. You see, I’ve been in Dallas 17 years and yet suddenly I get
involved in a very serious crime and I was very popular with the police department
and a lot of other people, and the irony is—it took a complete reverse of
that, because of various suspicions, nature, and so on.</p>

<p>I wonder if you follow what I’m trying to bring out? Maybe there’s something
we can cover in that area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Jack, let’s cover it this way. “Were any of your relations
with the police department improper?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No—you, like doing business or something or other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Yes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No—none whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Well, would that question cover what you had in mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Tell us what you had in mind and then we’ll frame the question,
because that’s an area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Whether or not I am of criminal background or whether I’m an
honest and sincere person, because all those things came out and suspicions came
out that Jack Ruby was involved in this and that and leaves a lot of suspicion
as to my background and my character. That’s very vague, but that’s what I’m
trying to bring out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. How would this question be? “Are you a police character?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. “Are you a 100 percent patriotic American citizen?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. “Are you a law-abiding citizen?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s better—that’s the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. “Are you a law-abiding patriotic citizen?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. “Are you a 100 percent American patriotic citizen?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That can be asked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That’s very good, because—shall I elaborate on this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I became closely attached to our beloved President when he gave
that wonderful speech when we had our problem in Cuba at that time. That
was a very tremendous speech and then I followed him on television and in
magazines wherever he went—to Ireland and different places.</p>

<p>Now, Joe asked a very good question. In other words, either you are American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">566</span>
or you’re half and half or you’re indifferent to the way you feel about your
country and how much you love it.</p>

<p>When he stated to me a moment ago, “Are you 100 percent American?”—that’s
the way you feel about your country. I don’t know how to state it but
first of all, I want to make sure—I’ve got my flags in both colors—that doesn’t
show any overt—but inwardly, I’m a very unstable person. I’m very lax in
certain details and things, and yet for the emotional feeling and the feeling for
giving my life and for loving this country is so great, that I think when you
asked me that question, “Are you 100 percent American?” and if I answered
the truth, it will greater effect than any other way you can ask me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Ruby, we can cover that one in a specific question, in another
general question, on whether you have told the complete truth here today. Are
there any other topics which you want to cover?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, yes, sir. Has any of the underworld ever contributed money
to me for my clubs, or was I put in here as a front for the underworld or things
to that effect. I mean—this has a relationship to criminal intent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We’ve asked you the question if the underworld had any connection
with the shooting of Oswald.</p>

<p>Let me now ask you for the record while you are under oath, whether you
were put in here by the underworld?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did the underworld contribute in any way to the financing of
any of your clubs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you had any connection or association in any way whatsoever
with the underworld during the past 17 years you’ve been in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Never have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, we’ll ask you in a few moments with Mr. Herndon, whether
you’ve told the truth, and that will be covered—that will cover this underworld
question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Just the one question is enough to cover it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Herndon advises that it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I can ask that question and have it a matter of record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You see, there are so many things that I know in the minds
of the people in Dallas that you’re not concerned with, that maybe I was put
here as a front of the underworld and sooner or later they will get something
out of me that they want done to their advantage.</p>

<p>Everything I have had financed, my brother Earl has contributed the money
for or Ralph Paul, a friend of mine, has loaned me money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Mr. Specter, if I can interrupt—on some of these questions
you are recently discussing here are more or less in the area of emotions and
the area dealing with advance psychology or of a psychiatric nature, and although
I can ask them if you so wish, they are questions that don’t necessarily
lend themselves to the polygraph technique.</p>

<p>Unless you can specifically break them down to a clearcut question which
could be answered truthfully “Yes” or “No,” that involves a specific action or
emotion that he can recall in regard to a particular action, then it would not be
a good question here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I agree with you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You see, this 100 percent American type question doesn’t necessarily
lend itself to polygraph examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I agree with your conclusion, but what we’re trying to do
now is to cover all of the important substantive questions which I think we
have. After Mr. Ruby tells me that he is satisfied with what we have covered,
I propose to ask the same question of Mr. Fowler and Mr. Alexander and also
Mr. Tonahill, so that we will have covered the subject matter. We will do
our utmost to be all-inclusive here, so that whatever effect the polygraph
can gage as to Mr. Ruby’s truthfulness, we will do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Let me put it this way: Here I run a nightclub. I run a nightclub
and on Friday this tragic event happens and I get carried away more so
than anyone else. Why? Why was I so sick mentally or so carried away?</p>

<p>I immediately replaced my newspaper ads so that I would be closed for those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">567</span>
3 days. This is the ironic part of it, that wouldn’t it be a tremendous hoax,
or certain people would probably believe it that way, that here’s a fellow that
didn’t vote for the President, closes his clubs for 3 days, made a trip to Cuba,
relayed a message from a person—from Ray Brantley—look at circumstantially
how guilty I am? If you want to put all these things together? Then,
I happen to be down there, which is a million and one shot, that I should
happen to be down there at that particular second when this man comes out
of whatever it was—an elevator or whatever it was—all these things—plus
the fact of the post office box and other rumors that they saw us together at
the club—how can we give me the clearance that the ads I put in were authentic,
my sincerity, my feeling of emotionalism were sincere; that that Sunday
morning I got carried away after reading the article, a letter addressed
to Caroline and then this little article that stated Mrs. Kennedy might be requested
to come back and face the ordeal of the trial?</p>

<p>Also, if there was a conspiracy, then this little girl that called me on the
phone in Fort Worth then is a part of the conspiracy. Do you follow me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I understand you, Mr. Ruby, but you have testified about most
of this on the prior occasion, such as seeing the article in the newspaper, about
the letter to little Caroline and about the necessity for Mrs. Kennedy to return,
and we have formulated the questions concerning the major topics which we
have of concern and have supplemented those topics in the questions to you. I
think in all fairness that we have gone as far as we can on any of the
substantive questions, and I want you to be satisfied, and the Commission
wants you to be satisfied, and that’s why I keep repeating the question—whether
you have any other topic. I can see you are trying to recollect
something else—so that you will have covered everything in a conclusive way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As soon as you are satisfied on that, I’m going to ask the other
gentlemen a question, as I say, and as a matter of fact, I can do that now
while you are still thinking.</p>

<p>I will ask Mr. Fowler if there is any other question that he would like
to have asked of you at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Sir, I know of no other questions that could be asked at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Tonahill, do you have any other questions you would like to
have asked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. No, I don’t. I think it has been very, very comprehensive.
From my knowledge of the background, I think if you asked Jack if he went
to the Dallas Morning News that morning to attend to business and protested
vigorously the ad insulting President Kennedy, if he protested because he’s a
100 percent patriotic American citizen, I think he would, tell you “Yes” and
he would be telling the truth.</p>

<p>I think if you asked him why he went out about 4 o’clock in the morning
with George Senator and Larry and took that picture of the <span class="locked">sign——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Don’t mention anything about that—we’re in a bad spot down
here because of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span> (continuing). Of Chief Justice Earl Warren, he would tell you
that he did it because he was going to turn it over to the FBI and some
attorneys, because he thought it was un-American and he did it because he’s
a 100 percent patriotic American citizen, and he’s telling the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I also went over to the post office to check on the box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. The same thing on the box—to see there if the post office
numbers on the sign and in the newspaper ad meant the same person was
behind it, which would be the John Birchers and Communists both, and he
wanted to do something about it because he’s a 100 percent patriotic American
citizen, he would be telling the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I didn’t know about the ad—you’re talking about the ad against
President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I didn’t refer to the John Birch—with reference to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. He wanted to see if they were connected together—the same
people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_568">568</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I didn’t mention the term “John Birch.” I just said, “I wonder
who could have placed that ad in there?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. That’s all I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Alexander, do you have any questions to ask?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. I have no questions to ask. I think it has been most
comprehensive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Ruby, did you go to the Dallas Morning News to protest
the advertisement that made derogatory statements about President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I went there to place my ad, because my business is very—it’s
very important that I’m there on the weekend, in the first place. My business
is conducted on a cash basis, and you can’t place your ads unless you are
there to pay for them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You testified to that before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you make any comment about the newspaper advertisement
which contained derogatory references to President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. We spoke about it up at the Morning News there, and I didn’t want
to make anything there about it because I knew they accepted it. They accepted
the ad. It would be rather embarrassing to say something to them because
they were responsible. The phones were ringing off the desks with people
canceling various ads and so on, but I did make—I went to the Turf Club—that’s
where I got all hepped up about it—over at the Turf Lounge, and I
went to the post office to find out who was it that placed that ad, you know, and
how it came about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you satisfied then, Mr. Ruby, if we ask you one more
question on the polygraph, specifically, “Has all the information which you have
testified to today been the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Plus the fact that I do want to get in my feeling for Americanism
and how I felt, because—remember—there may be unseen persons that may
not believe in my sincerity, so I want that specifically asked—how I feel about
my country I live in and so on, unless it’s repeating something. Is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, we will ask it of you again so that there’s no question
about. We will formulate the question, “Do you consider yourself to be a 100
percent American patriot?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And then we’ll ask the general question about whether every
bit of information you’ve given us today has been the whole truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right, will you proceed, Mr. Herndon and ask those two
questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. One more thing—shouldn’t you ask me, or isn’t it necessary, why
I suddenly was so carried away to get involved in this serious crime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Jack, that won’t work on the machine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We have to ask you a “Yes” or “No” question, and we’ve already
covered that by asking you the question about Mrs. Kennedy—whether you
didn’t shoot Oswald to avoid having her come to trial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes; that covers that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That covers that subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. In other words, I can’t answer that truthfully and have another
reason for doing it; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. That would answer that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes. We’ve asked you all the <span class="locked">reasons——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. But you don’t ask me why I did it, though? Why I was carried
away so much—you don’t ask me that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We did ask you—we asked you “Why did you shoot Oswald?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. But you don’t ask me why I got carried away so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, it’s the same question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Oh, it’s the same question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. This is the same question—in the form of: “Did you do it in order
to save Mrs. Kennedy the travail of a trip to Dallas?” That subject matter has
been covered as comprehensively as we can through the polygraph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_569">569</span>
Now, will you proceed, Mr. Herndon, and ask those final questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I would like to proceed with, “Are you Jack Ruby?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That’s fine—that’s your line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Then, I’ll ask you. “Do you consider yourself to be a 100 percent
American patriot?”</p>

<p>Then, what was the last question you wanted asked, Mr. Specter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. “Is all of the testimony given by you today the complete truth?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I think I can ask those questions now.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruby, does this noise disturb you right now, are you conscious of it or
aware of it [referring to audible conversations between other jail occupants
outside this room]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I hear it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Are you all right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Are you tired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. No; I’m all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Are you getting a little tired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I’m all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I’ll ask you just these last few questions. Would you once again
kindly put your feet flat on the floor, and let’s put these back so you will be
comfortable.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 8:55 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I will have to wait for the instrument to warm up just a second.
This will be series No. 11.</p>

<p>(Mr. Herndon snapped his fingers one time.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Are you ready to proceed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I’ll just ask these three questions, and once again, these are
more or less summation questions here, and I want you just to relax and answer
them simply, “Yes” or “No.”</p>

<p>The series will now begin.</p>

<p>“Are you Jack Ruby?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Do you consider yourself to be a 100 percent American patriot?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. “Has all the testimony given by you today been the complete
truth?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The series is over.</p>

<p>(Reporter’s note: 8:59 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I have no questions, Mr. Specter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you. That concludes the polygraph examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Now, I will take all this paraphernalia off of you, Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I would like to have you sign your name about 10 times, for us,
Mr. Ruby, and would you put the date on this for us too? The date is July 18,
1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Let me have my glasses, Joe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span> (handed glasses to Mr. Ruby).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And now would you write the sentence at the bottom, “Now is the
time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span> (complied with request of Mr. Specter).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, would you skip down and write that again. I would like
for you to write that three times in all, and you might sit down and take a chair
and do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span> (complied with request of Mr. Specter).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Very good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. What time is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. It’s 9 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I have five after nine—Dallas, Tex., time.</p>

Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. Joe, are you going to do what I asked you to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. I’m going to do my best. You know me well enough to know
that I’m going to do my best.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I know you well enough.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. You were very cooperative, Mr. Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Goodbye, Jack. Good to see you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You’re going to do what I ask you to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. I’m going to do my best. I told you I would. Everything
I do is for your best interest and I have worked awful hard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. I know. You are a big man and I know how big you can be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. I’m going to do my best, like I said, and not let anything under
the sun happen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ruby</span>. You know what I’m talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. I know exactly what you’re talking about.</p>

<h2 id="BEAVERS">TESTIMONY OF DR. WILLIAM ROBERT BEAVERS</h2>
</div>

<p>The testimony of Dr. William Robert Beavers was taken at 9:10 p.m., on
July 18, 1964, at the Dallas County Jail, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter,
assistant counsel of the President’s Commission. Present were: Bell P. Herndon
and W. James Wood, special agents of the FBI; Clayton Fowler and Joe H.
Tonahill, counsel for Jack Ruby; William F. Alexander, assistant district
attorney for Dallas County, Tex.; and E. L. Holman, chief jailer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that it is 10 minutes after 9 p.m. and
that Mr. Ruby has departed in the custody of Chief Jailer E. L. Holman and
that we are reconvening for the purpose of taking testimony from Dr. William
Robert Beavers at the request of Mr. Fowler and Mr. Tonahill.</p>

<p>Dr. Beavers, would you stand and raise your right hand, please? Do you
solemnly swear that the testimony you shall give in this proceeding before the
President’s Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy shall be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you be seated please, and state your full name for the record.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. William Robert Beavers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your occupation or profession, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. I am a psychiatrist and physician.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you set forth your home and office addresses, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Yes. My home address is 4071 Northlawn Drive, Dallas. My
office is at 3911 Maple, Dallas, which is Woodlawn Psychiatric Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you describe briefly your educational background, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Yes, I finished medical school here at Southwestern in Dallas
in 1953, interned in Wayne County General Hospital in Eloise, Mich. I had a
fellowship in pharmacology in 1954–55, spent 2 years in the Air Force in the
Arctic in research and returned; I was an assistant professor of pharmacology
for 3 years and during that time I took a year of internal medicine at St. Paul’s
Hospital here in Dallas. Following this in 1960 I entered a residency in
psychiatry at Southwestern here in Dallas and completed the residency in 1963.
Following this, I went back on the faculty of the Medical School as assistant
professor of psychiatry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, do you hold the latter position at the present time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you a member of any accredited psychiatric societies?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_571">571</span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Yes; I’m a member of the Dallas neuropsychiatric group, the
Texas Neuropsychiatric Society and the American Psychiatric Association.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now set forth the major items of your background
with respect to qualifications in the field of psychiatry?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Perhaps it should be mentioned that I am on the attending
staff at Parkland as a psychiatrist and that I consult at the Terrell State
Hospital as a psychiatrist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you had occasion to examine Mr. Jack Ruby prior to
today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Yes; on numerous occasions prior to about 4 weeks ago, did I
see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On approximately how many occasions have you examined
Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Without my records here, it would not completely accurate, but
it would be in the area of about 9 or 10 times, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you observe with respect to Mr. Ruby’s mental
condition during the course of those examinations?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. I saw him first—can I get somebody to help me with a date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. April the 27th, the 28th, or 29th of this year.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. The day that Dr. West first came down was on a Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Yes, that was the 26th of April.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. He testified Monday morning and then I saw Mr. Ruby first on
that Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. The 28th.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Right, and at that time he had briefly what I call a psychotic
depression, that is, he had evidences of auditory hallucinations and a poorly
defined but definite delusional system which waxed and waned during the time
of the interview, and he had evidence of a severe degree of depression.</p>

<p>Because of the combined symptoms of the hallucinatory activity, the delusions
in which, and I should spell them out, that he felt that both members of his
family, his close family, were being harmed, mutilated and/or destroyed because
of his crime, and further, that there was a pogrom concerning Jews
generally because of his crime.</p>

<p>These symptoms plus the depression which was evident, caused me to diagnose
a psychotic depressive reaction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now stated your conclusion regarding his mental state?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. At that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And have you set forth the essence of the underlying factors
relating to that conclusion?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. In very brief nature—yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have any different conclusion as to his mental state
today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Yes. I do. I think that as I have seen him, the depressive element
has diminished, and that the delusional system has become much less open
and obvious, and that it has become more fixed, and it seems to—and this I’m
not sure of—whether it waxes and wanes depending on the time in the weeks or
whether it waxes and wanes depending on the closeness of the people that he
sees.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Doctor, when you say that the state is much less open, do you
mean by that, that it is now more obvious?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Less obvious.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Less obvious?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Less obvious.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But is it present, notwithstanding the degree of how much it is
apparent?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. In my opinion it is. Yes. The thing that I’m trying to make
clear here is that you take a person that has a mental illness which shows
itself in delusions, that is, ideas that things that we say aren’t real—they can
be very uncertain and changing and very obvious, and which the person will
share them with just about anybody, or they can be much more covert—hidden—and
shared only seldom, and much more fixed, not shifting around, but fixed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_572">572</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How would you characterize his condition in your opinion as he
sat here today during the polygraph examination?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Based on—let’s see if I can give the specific things that make
me come up with this opinion—the relationship that he has with the prosecuting
attorney, the relationship he has with his attorneys; there are certain kinds
of actions and behavior in these two relationships which fit better in my opinion
with the continuation of a covert delusional system concerning threat to his race,
his family, based on his presumed activity in a conspiracy, then it would fit
with rational realistic appreciation of the factors in his environment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you present today, Dr. Beavers, during the entire course
of the polygraph examination?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Yes, I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In your opinion, was Mr. Ruby in contact with reality during
the course of the polygraph examination?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. In the greater proportion of the time that he answered the questions,
I felt that he was aware of the questions and that he understood them, and
that he was giving answers based on an appreciation of reality.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any element of a delusional state present in the answers
which he gave during the course of this polygraphic examination?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. I felt the only time that there were questions which tapped
any of the underlying delusional systems were the questions relating to his
opinion about the safety of his defense counsel and the safety of his family,
either past or present.</p>

<p>It seemed to me, because he was fairly certain in his answers during the trial
run, and then following this during the actual run of the polygraph, there was
so much hesitation and uncertainty which resulted in no answers, that we were
seeing a good deal of internal struggle as to just what was reality.</p>

<p>His explanation following this, following the run of the polygraph, I don’t
think enlightened us very much in terms of what it was he was actually feeling
or thinking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But would you have concluded that he was delusional had he
stated that his family and his attorneys were in danger?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. I’ve got to think about that. You can’t answer it “Yes”—if it
had been as strong a question as it might have been possible to frame, but I
feel that to get a perfectly accurate idea of what he meant by it would require
more than a “Yes” or “No” answer, but this would have been one of things that
had he answered it directly, that would have led me to think that he had an
area here where reality in the testimony was poor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, does his refusal to answer that question during the course
of the polygraph examination, subject to the analysis that the polygraphic examinations
can bring to bear, indicate that he is not in a delusional state?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. I’m not sure I follow you here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, perhaps I can rephrase that.</p>

<p>During the course of the polygraphic examinations, he is subject to certain
checks on truthfulness, at least to some extent.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. I see what you’re getting at now.</p>

<p>That would be an assumption, I think, on both our parts that I wouldn’t make
as to why he didn’t answer. It possibly could have been his trying to protect
in some way an answer from the polygraph.</p>

<p>I felt it equally likely that it was the fact that it was the second time through
on the same question which he had answered first and then there had been a
lot of thinking going on, was a great deal more opportunity for uncertainty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So, you think his first answer that his family and counsel were
in danger, indicated to some extent at least, a delusional state, and then after
he had had an opportunity to consider it, that he became uncertain because of
the greater opportunity to focus on what in your opinion was a delusion to start
with?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Yes. This thing to me is complicated, maybe because—for example,
if I can digress for a moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; feel free to do that.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Chief Holman has told me a number of times and I have seen
it in a sense, he feels that this man has tried to seem delusional. On the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">573</span>
hand, at times it is quite obvious that he is trying to seem sane and becomes
quite truculent and angry at people who imply that he was in fact of unsound
mind.</p>

<p>One of the things I think that is extremely obvious in any of this man’s discourse
over a period of time is the marked ambivalence, that is, the mixed feelings
which are strong but on both sides of almost any position that he has taken.</p>

<p>This may be true at the time or it may be true sequentially, so that on the
one hand we see him trying to appear quite sane and according to some testimony,
at times he has not done this but in fact, not according to my own testimony,
but the statements that I have heard from others, he has tried to appear
a little bit more delusional than the person thought that he was.</p>

<p>Now, I felt that this answer that we saw the second time around was consistent
with the same attitude that he had when he came, when he was stating
very definitely that he was not of unsound mind. In other words, it may have
given him a little more time to cover.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Aside from the questions to which you have referred on the
danger to counsel and family, did the delusional state which you have characterized
as his condition of today, have any effect in your opinion on the polygraphic
examination?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. I can’t answer the question like it’s put, but I can answer it this
way, if I may, because I’m just not an expert on that box over there. I don’t
know that much about polygraph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You are referring to the polygraph machine. Well, consider the
question rephrased in a manner that you find it convenient to respond to?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. All right. I felt that so far as my ability to evaluate this man
in responding to questions, that any delusional state did not interfere with
awareness of the past, with the presence of seemingly adequate memory, with
the presence of an apparently reasonable appreciation of reality in reference to
his whereabouts and his behavior in the critical time that was under discussion.</p>

<p>In short, he seemed to behave like a man with a well-fixed delusional system
in which whole areas of his thinking and his behavior is not strongly interfered
by the delusion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that the major portion of the polygraphic examination then,
except for those parts which you have already referred to, would not be affected
in your opinion by what you have characterized as his delusional state?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. In my opinion, the major portion of his appreciation of questions
and of his answers would be unaffected by the delusional state.</p>

<p>I just can’t, you see, in all honesty, answer something about what the machine
taps, because I think I would sort of be making a fool of myself because I don’t
know that much about polygraph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Beavers, do you have an opinion as to whether the polygraphic
examination which was conducted here today hurt Mr. Ruby mentally
or physically in any way?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Well, after the period of time, I think we were all fatigued. I
think he was and I think everybody in the room was. I felt that he was fatigued
as the rest of us were, during the course of a pretty long number of hours of
interrogation.</p>

<p>Whether this would come under the heading of any physical harm, I don’t
know. I would not consider it so ordinarily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would that fatigue diminish or evaporate with some rest tonight?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. I think so; I think so. I know what you’re trying to get at and
I’ll try to answer it the best I can. The question of whether his mental state,
and secondarily, a physical problem would be seriously affected by having this
interrogation, by having this man take a polygraph examination. The one thing
that this man has not been ambivalent on since my acquaintanceship with him,
and I mean that so far as I can think of literally, the one area, the one subject
that he has not been having these mixed feelings about is the fact that he did
want to make this testimony, either with truth serum or with a polygraph or
some way of getting the truth out.</p>

<p>Now, as a physician, and this was my role in these evaluations, not at the time
and so far until right now, not as somebody testifying, I was concerned with his
mental state, and rather early I felt there would possibly be something useful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_574">574</span>
so far as the man’s mental state, if he could have a chance to tell his story.
The mixture of what I consider his delusional state surrounding the possible
conspiracy that people thought that he had, and therefore this tremendous number
of destructive actions, that were presumably going on, fitted to an extent with
some published reports of people’s opinions here and abroad. In short, there
has been a mixture of the delusional and of the factual, a mixture of his confusion
and a mixture of all other people’s confusion, and he is aware of it and
has been, because apparently he gets newspapers. Apparently he has access to
what both reasoned and unreasoned statements that are made. Consequently, I
felt that it would be useful, if anything, that he be allowed a chance for this.
I haven’t stated this to anybody, I don’t think, because there were a lot of other
things that I could not evaluate. I’m not in a position to evaluate the legal or
other reasons that might not be useful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But with respect to his mental status, would it have been your
expectation prior to the time that the polygraph examination started that it
would have been beneficial rather than harmful to have it conducted?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. If anything, the odds are good that it actually wouldn’t do much
one way or the other in my opinion, but the feeling of getting out the catharsis
or the getting his story before the people that he has felt, for example, including
the State, that were involved in some kind of action against people he cared for,
because they assumed erroneously there was some conspiracy, then this might
have some beneficial effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is your conclusion after being present during the
course of the polygraphic examination as to whether it had beneficial effect or
not?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. It’s hard to say. I think he held up rather remarkedly well.
At least, this is my opinion. I haven’t been present with polygraph interrogations,
but he certainly did not show undue stress, either physical or emotional,
and handled the questions better than I thought he would. It did seem like
he was getting, in a sense, his day in court, which was by reasons of his, as I
understand it, trial procedure and presumed defense tactics not allowed him in
the first trial. This to me is what he kept coming back to during the course of
the examination, that he wanted to get his story out, and during the times I
have seen him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is it your interpretation that the consequence during the course
of this polygraph examination may have the ultimate consequence of benefiting
him?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. I think it could. I would suspect, if I tried to look and see what
would happen tomorrow, that he might be somewhat depressed. This usually
is what happens with somebody who has been looking forward to something
for a long, long time that’s going to be solving all of his problems and it actually
happens and nothing much is different, but I think he will be depressed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. If he is depressed tomorrow, is that what you would think would
be a temporary state?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Yes; I think it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that that would not necessarily characterize the longrun
effects of this examination?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. That’s correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you characterized a few moments ago his situation as
being fatigued, as we all were, do you think that he understood all the questions
which were being put to him and then answered them responsively, or do you
think that at some point his fatigue reached such a point that he was not responding
understandably to the questions?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. I was impressed with the skill of the man giving the test. I
felt the breaks were fairly well spaced. He didn’t show an excessive amount
of fatigue, in my view, except before the first break. He seemed to show more
fatigue then than he did later on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Of course, you observed his interest in pursuing a great many
topics and the difficulty really in bringing the examination to a close.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Yes; which sort of fits with my feeling about the depression a
little bit in that he was aware that, well, “the show is about over,” that his day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_575">575</span>
in court was coming to a close, and I suspect that the long-expected kinds of
feelings probably were not as great as he hoped for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything else to add which you think would be
helpful to the President’s Commission in any way?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. I would only say that I think I’ll make it my business to read
up a little bit on some of the interrelationships between mental illness and polygraph.
When I state that I’m not an expert in this area, it’s true. If by a combination
of my readings, which I plan to do, and my presence here and my
previous and present views of Mr. Ruby, I might be of help in forming an opinion,
I will be available.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. If you find through that course of study that you have anything
to add, I’m certain the Commission would be interested in having any supplemental
observations or conclusions on your part.</p>

<p>Mr. Fowler, do you have anything you would care to ask Dr. Beavers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. I am requesting Mr. Tonahill to ask a few questions, if you have
no objection, which is not in the way of cross-examination but just by way of
a further development.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right, Mr. Tonahill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Dr. Beavers, during the trial of Jack Ruby for the murder of
Lee Harvey Oswald, Mr. Bill Alexander, the assistant district attorney, sought
and obtained a death sentence for Jack Ruby for the murder of Oswald, and I
along with other counsel sought far less—an acquittal or at least a number of
years. You have noted, have you not, here that Mr. Ruby resents my presence.
He says I’m not his attorney and then asked me to do him favors and this, that,
and the other, and you have noticed he has tremendous faith and confidence in
Mr. Alexander, who obviously is here to, in the event of another trial—and in
the event of Mr. Fowler’s efforts and mine to obtain another trial for him is
successful—he is here to obtain information for the benefit and use of whatever
information he can get to get another death penalty.</p>

<p>Have you an opinion as to what goes on with reference to Ruby’s mental
illness that causes him to put faith in Mr. Alexander and no faith in me. With
reference to the question—is his mental state such that he can’t aid and assist
his lawyers in their efforts to appeal his sentence and try to get him a new trial,
and in his defense, and in the management of his personal affairs, is he of
such mental incompetency that those things indicate to you that there is something
in his mind, something mentally ill about him that prevents him from
realizing what is best for him in his dealings with the prosecutor and his defense
attorneys, and in connection with managing his affairs and in helping his defense
attorneys in his ability, his capacity, his capabilities of handling his personal
affairs. What is your feeling about that from what you’ve seen here today and
what you’ve known from other observations of Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Maybe I can get it in pieces and parts of that—I don’t know.
I think the question of mental competency in the hearing that’s going to be
coming up in the future, at least from what I read in the newspapers, and I
think possibly rather than an off-the-cuff answer, you may have to sort of
settle for a statement that I made concerning his mental illness, because I don’t
do a whole lot of legal work, and I would be quite cautious in making a statement
concerning the specific legal questions about competency for affairs until
I got more acquainted with this particular statute.</p>

<p>In other words, if you’re asking me a question about his mental status and
the mental illness, maybe I can make some comments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Well, I was trying to do it, but I wanted to give you a little
range and you could pinpoint yourself down to such as the episodes here today
between the relationship of his own lawyers and his apparent partiality to
Mr. Alexander here.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. This is what I referred to earlier, and I will be glad to amplify
it a bit. On the face of it, it seems to me that as far as an awareness
and appreciation of reality, there was this jeopardy—that some of the behavior
that he had toward Mr. Alexander as far as wanting him very definitely
to be in the room when he made certain damaging statements concerning the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_576">576</span>
amount of premeditation—this would not be the actions of a wise and prudent
man in my opinion. I think it does fit more clearly with his previously stated
delusional material to me, that in fact there is a considerable body of people,
the district attorney’s office and district attorneys included, who do feel that
he is a part of a conspiracy, and that in fact either past, present and/or future
actions toward loved ones and toward members of his race are going to be
taken against these people because of this presumed conspiracy. If this were
the case, then it would make extremely good sense that he would want Mr.
Alexander here, and he would want him here very definitely because he, instead
of being wise and prudent in the defense of his presumed safety and welfare
at a future trial, he is much more concerned with getting the truth out so that
a whole host of terrible things won’t happen.</p>

<p>Now, in reference to his activities toward you [referring to Mr. Tonahill],
the ambivalence we talked about was beautifully illustrated. He begins by
reading you out, by firing you in a sense, and then later on in the middle of the
activities he begins to have a markedly warm attitude toward you and begins
to refer to you as, I think, “Joe,” once again. A reverse I may have noticed
of this, of two or three changes back and forth, but they were both distinctly
and clearly expressed, which has been my experience and also my opinion based
on working with people who have this kind of a delusional system, that they
show consistently, that is, with somebody who is related to them very closely—you’re
going to catch hell and then you’re going to be responded to in an effort
of bringing you back. In other words, I think there is a probability that the
reasons for relating warmly to the district attorney’s representative and ambivalently
toward you are as I have stated, and very slightly different from one
another.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. In his present mental state, do you feel he is capable of conferring
with Mr. Fowler and me and Mr. Burleson and aiding and assisting us
in an appellate effort in his behalf in reference to his mental capacity?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. This entails two questions—one, his mental state, and two, how
much in fact is involved in aiding you in this appeal.</p>

<p>Now, to the first one, I hope and am reasonably confident of the opinion I
have given of this present mental illness at this time. As to the latter, I have
sort of opinions off-the-cuff from everything that he needs to be pretty savvy
and help you out, to the fact that it doesn’t make any difference at all as to
whether he can talk or not in terms of an appeal, so I don’t know, because I don’t
know No. 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. You and Dr. Holbrook, Dr. John Holbrook, who has examined
him, and Dr. Stubblefield who has examined him, and Dr. West who has
examined him, all four psychiatrists and outstanding <span class="locked">men——</span></p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. And Dr. Tanay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. And Dr. Tanay—five. Is it uniform agreement among you five
gentlemen that Jack Ruby is mentally ill and suffers with psychotic delusions?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. The last time I talked to the other four gentlemen you have just
mentioned, their opinion was the same as my own. I couldn’t state if anybody
changed their mind. Dr. Tanay, following his visit here, and I had lunch together
and discussed the case. At the time that we talked to the judge, Dr.
Stubblefield and I, and then some 2 weeks later, shared our views, and they
were in reasonably consistent agreement. There was no disparity to speak
of. Dr. West, I talked to by telephone about 2 weeks ago, I believe.</p>

<p>Do you remember when that was, Mr. Fowler?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. I think perhaps that would be a month ago, Dr. Beavers, or
somewhere thereabouts.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Well, it was after I came back from vacation. At any rate,
between 2 weeks and a month ago, I believe, and his view was that this man
was mentally ill, and further than that, that he was pretty much as I have
described him here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. And there have been instances where he rammed his head
into the wall and then tried to get his finger up in the light socket, and then
tried to rip the seam out of his trousers to kill himself, you felt he was suicidal
and should be protected from that effort, and all of you agreed on that, I believe?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Yes. It really wasn’t based on those actions as much as, I think,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_577">577</span>
the depression that I saw initially, which has cleared up somewhat as he has
gotten more delusionary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. You all felt that he should be out of jail and in a mental
hospital where he could get adequate mental care and mental treatment, from
psychiatric care and therapy medications?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Yes; I thought this and this was the recommendation of the
other doctors that saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. That would be Dr. Stubblefield, Dr. Holbrook, Dr. West, and
Dr. Tanay?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. I’m not sure about Dr. Tanay. I don’t know that I heard him
state that specific thing. I do know that the recommendation of Dr. Holbrook
and Dr. Stubblefield and myself, and further that Dr. West, made the same
recommendation. I do feel that we had two problems. One was security as
well as medical care. I feel like maybe I was perhaps a little bit more concerned
about this than maybe some of the other specialists; I don’t know. This just
happened to be my own view, that I was not only concerned about this man,
hopefully finding a place for hospitalization, but that it would have to be a place
where he had adequate security from without as well as any idea of suicide.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Is there anything unusual about a person who is mentally ill
and of unsound mind, still possessing keen memory faculties and being able to
recall things accurately and clearly as well as being able to give responsive
answers and to be in touch with reality?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Oh, I would say that many people of unsound mind are deteriorated
enough that they do not have adequate memory. Early in the
course of many mental illnesses a lot of the faculties, including memory, are
preserved, so that this in itself I don’t think would—because he has an apparently
good memory would not mean that he is of sound mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. That’s what I mean—that there’s nothing unusual about the
fact that he could still be of unsound mind and still have good recall and good
response to the questions asked by the polygraph operator?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. I’m a little hung up on the term “unusual,” because to me, this
is a statistical matter when you put it in that phrase, and then you would be
talking about what percentage of people do and what percentage of people don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. I don’t mean to do that.</p>

<p>I meant to ask you specifically, can Jack Ruby be of unsound mind, not know
right from wrong, appreciate the nature and quality of his actions, and still have a
keen memory, a good memory, and give clear response to questions that appear
to place him in touch with reality?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. In my opinion this is possible for a person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Is it reasonably probable from the standpoint of medical
certainty in your profession?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. I think so. You have included a question that I find it very
difficult to answer—this business of right and wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. I stated my opinion to the Dallas Criminal Bar Association
concerning this particular phraseology, and you asked it inclusive, in terms
of several things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Well, with Mr. Alexander’s help, we’re going to eliminate
that from the criminal test for insanity in criminal law in Texas.</p>

<p>I believe that’s all, unless Mr. Fowler has something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. Let me ask one thing, Dr. Beavers.</p>

<p>I believe that you do have a written report that you have submitted to the
court, is that correct?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Yes, sir. Now, I submitted a written report about the first
evaluation, not to the court but to Mr. Burleson, who requested my services
on behalf of family.</p>

<p>I then sent a shorter report, which included the major points and the recommendations,
to the attorneys, to the judge, to Sheriff Decker, and I believe
that’s all.</p>

<p>Now, I assume, and I think it’s the case that probably the defense attorneys
passed the report on to the judge, but I did not send it myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_578">578</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. In any of these reports, you have no objection to making them
available to this Commission?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Oh, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. If they are requested?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. If the rights of the patient and the defense attorneys are in
agreement—if the rights of the patient are maintained—no, I have no objection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. I think it would be nice, if you would, let him have copies
of all the reports you have written with respect to his illness, and they would
not involve any jeopardy of Mr. Ruby’s rights at all, if you would mail them
to Mr. Specter.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Would you like to have them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The Commission would be glad to receive any reports you
have or any other supplemental information that you may wish to provide.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. I’ll be happy to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Alexander, do you have a question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Just one or two questions.</p>

<p>Do you recognize that late counsel for the defense, Mr. Fowler, did not participate
in the Jack Ruby trial and is not as aware of the facts brought out
in the investigation as perhaps I, who was in on it at the first, or Mr. Tonahill,
who was in on the trial? You appreciate that, do you not?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. You are saying <span class="locked">that——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. That Mr. Fowler got in so late on this thing that he probably
doesn’t know—that he is not as aware of the facts of the case as I am?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. I don’t know how I would know that. I know when he came
in, but how aware of the facts he is, I don’t know that. How would I know
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Did it appear to you that Ruby was looking to me for aid
in framing some of these questions because of my peculiar knowledge of the
case, in that I was in on it from the moment of the assassination of the
President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. I noticed that he did look to you in terms of getting some sort
of support or information or possibly framing questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. And you see nothing unusual in that, considering the fact
that I am probably the one person that has possession of the most facts?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. I think I have already covered what I felt was probable,
as far as what was going on with Mr. Ruby as to how he behaved here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Did you feel that he wanted me particularly to know the
truth about certain areas or at least the truth as he represented it?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. You did not feel that I took advantage of him in any way
here today, do you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. No, I thought you were extremely gentlemanly and pleasantly
helpful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. I am not making that comment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. You have been the most cordial since we have been in this, Bill.</p>

<p>Let me make one other statement—this is relevant.</p>

<p>Are you through, Bill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. I wish to make this statement for the record that at some time
during the course of this interrogation and hearing, that I was called by Mr. Bill
Decker, stating that a telephone call, long distance, had been made to him. I
answered the phone and Mr. Earl Ruby and Mr. Sol Dann were on the phone
speaking from Detroit. They wanted to know what was going on and who had
authorized this hearing, and why I came down and why Mr. Tonahill was here,
and why we did not stop the hearing.</p>

<p>I tried to the best of my ability to explain to him that I had talked with Jack
and has also explained to the Commission that we were of the opinion that Mr.
Ruby had certain rights that might be violated here, but that this was entirely
the wishes and demands of Jack Ruby himself, and these matters had been set up
prior to my entrance into the case and prior to the entrance of Mr. Dann, and
that I could not control them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_579">579</span>
I was informed by Mr. Dann at that time that it was his intention to immediately
contact the Warren Commission in Washington and file a criminal case,
a case of assault and battery, against all parties conducting this hearing, including
myself and Mr. Tonahill. At this point I was summarily fired, together with
Mr. Tonahill, and I feel that this matter of course is something that Mr. Dann
is not aware of, that all of this that has taken place here today—I think that we
have tried to protect the rights of Jack Ruby, and I put this in to merely show
that the call was made, and if any of you gentlemen have fear of reprisal or for
whatever purpose it might be, and that I am sure that something further will
be made of it.</p>

<p>Again, I wish to state this that in my opinion, whether we are still employed
in the case, and I have not been fired by Jack Ruby, that we feel absolutely that
his rights have been protected.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. His brother Earl has not fired you either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That concludes the proceedings. Thank you all very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. Just one more thing.</p>

<p>I myself will make no statement to anybody outside this room about anything,
and let me make the suggestion that whatever statement is made, is made by
Mr. Specter, if you want to agree on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. In fact I think that if Mr. Specter is going to give this statement,
that if he tells them that a polygraph has been taken, I don’t think any of
the questions and answers should be given out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span>. No; I very definitely and specifically request that these matters
that have been gone into here today be for the Commission and the Commission
only. It is our wish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That will be done. The Commission heretofore has made no
public statement of content to any extent. It has been the practice of the Commission
to announce only what witnesses have been heard, and a very general
statement of the witness’ status. In fact, Mr. Ruby was insistent that there
be a statement made in terms of his request and his cooperation, and that had
been discussed before as being the appropriate limit of such a statement. It’s
my view that that should be followed up on, but no details of any sort stated as
to his responses or anything else that transpired in this proceeding today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tonahill</span>. Yes; that he cooperated to the best of his ability.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Beavers</span>. Any questions that are asked me, I will refer to Mr. Arlen
Specter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Very fine, Dr. Beavers.</p>

<p>Thank you very much. This will conclude these proceedings.</p>

<h2 id="HERNDON">TESTIMONY OF BELL P. HERNDON</h2>
</div>

<p>The testimony of Bell P. Herndon was taken at 2:05 p.m., on July 28, 1964,
at 200 Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C., by Mr. Arlen Specter, assistant
counsel of the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that this is a deposition proceeding of the
President’s Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Present today is Mr. Bell P. Herndon, a special agent of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, who has been asked to testify concerning the results of the
polygraph examination administered to Jack Ruby in Dallas, Tex., on July 18,
1964.</p>

<p>With that preliminary statement of purpose, would you rise, please, Mr.
Herndon, and raise your right hand?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you shall give in this deposition
proceeding before the President’s Commission on the Assassination of President
Kennedy will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so
help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_580">580</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. My name is Bell P. Herndon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your profession or occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I am a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long have you been so occupied?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I have been employed as a special agent going on 14 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What specialty, if any, do you have with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I am presently the polygraph supervisor and polygraph examiner
assigned to the FBI laboratory, Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you outline briefly your educational background, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I received a bachelor of science degree from St. Lawrence University
in 1947.</p>

<p>I have been in the FBI since 1951 and have been employed as a special
agent primarily in field investigator work for approximately 10 years. The
past 4 years I have been fully assigned to the laboratory in the capacity of a
polygraph supervisor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What specialized training, if any, do you receive in order to
qualify for being a polygraph operator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Upon assignment to the FBI laboratory I underwent an intensive
6-months training program under a doctor, Ph. D. in psychology, who
was a special agent polygraph examiner assigned to the New York office.</p>

<p>I also received considerable training from other special agents in the FBI
laboratory who had graduate work in physiology and law.</p>

<p>After completion of 6 months’ intensive training, I was declared qualified to
handle polygraph examinations for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And approximately how many polygraphic examinations have
you conducted during your service with the Federal Bureau of Investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I have either given, supervised, or reviewed several thousand
polygraph examinations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you outline briefly just what the polygraph machine is,
and how it functions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The polygraph instrument, of course, is commonly known to
the public as the lie detector. In fact it is not such a device. The polygraph
is simply an instrument which is designed to record certain physiological responses
under stimuli in a carefully controlled interrogation. These physiological
responses may accompany and indicate deception. It is used primarily
as an investigative aid by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. From what does the machine derive its name “polygraph”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The name polygraph is derived from the Greek derivative,
poly meaning many, graph meaning writings and the actual polygraph chart
will portray several writings indicating physiological responses of the examinee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many writings are there specifically which are made by
the polygraph instrument?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. On the current polygraph used throughout the field the instrument
records three different physiological responses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And would you identify those three physiological responses,
please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The first physiological response recorded on the polygraph pertains
to the pneumograph tracing, pneumo pertains to the respiratory pattern
of an individual. In other words, it records the inhalation and exhalation
tracings of the person as he is normally breathing. It also records what we
call the respiratory ratio, the ratio of the inhalation stroke to the exhalation
stroke.</p>

<p>The second component utilized in the polygraph technique today is generally
called the psychogalvanic skin response.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Spell that, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Actually, it is referred to as the galvanic skin response, galvanic.
This particular response is obtained by electrodes placed on the examinee’s
hands or fingers, a small minute amount of electrical current is passed
through the skin, and the galvanometer will record the minute changes in the
electrical skin resistance of the skin or the electrodermal response.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_581">581</span>
The third component utilized in polygraph technique is the cardiograph.
This particular component measures the relative blood pressure changes and
also the changes in the heart rate or pulse beat. The tracing is obtained by a
pneumatic cuff being placed on the arm, usually the left arm, a certain amount
of pressure applied so that the mean blood pressure can be obtained and the
tracing is recorded on a moving sheet of chart paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you outline briefly the development of the polygraph
instrument, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Over the years psychologists and physiologists have been aware
of the fact that many people seem to respond physiologically under emotional
stress, one, of course, being under a stress of a deception.</p>

<p>The more serious lie a person tells, quite frequently he is likely to have a
physiological response. Over the years people who have dealt with interrogation
techniques have frequently noticed that when a person is deceiving, that
they visibly respond emotionally. In other words, they may not look a person
right in the eye.</p>

<p>There may be a choking up of the throat. They may become flushed in the
face. Based on this general common sense observation, law enforcement individuals
who had psychological and physiological training decided in about 1920
that if they could obtain an instrument to record certain physiological, changes
with regard to suspects in criminal cases, they might be in a better position to
perhaps determine whether or not the person has been telling the truth.</p>

<p>They developed an instrument which was eventually called the polygraph or
so-called lie detector.</p>

<p>Through the years it has been used by law enforcement. It is primarily used,
as I said before, as an investigative aid, and it has been helpful in that it can
provide investigative direction to people in the law enforcement profession.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is its level of reliability in indicating patterns of deception?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. There has been no conclusive scientific objective study in that
regard, and as of today there are no valid statistics with regard to its actual
objective reliability.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your opinion as to its level of reliability in measuring
patterns of deception in a normal person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Well, the polygraph, of course, measures certain physiological
responses which have to be interpreted. It must be clearly understood that the
physiological responses that are portrayed on a polygraph chart can often be
caused by things other than deception, such as fear, anxiety, nervousness, dislike,
and many other of these emotions.</p>

<p>A polygraph examiner has to be extremely skilled and conservative in his
estimation as to whether or not it is deception. I cannot give you any clear-cut
personal opinion as to the validity of the technique with regard to its percentage
of reliability.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Aside from an opinion as to percentage of reliability, what is
your opinion in a very general way as to the ability of a well-trained, conservative
examiner to detect a pattern of deception in a normal person under appropriate
standards of administration?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Based on a hypothesis of all factors you mentioned, a
polygraph examiner under ideal conditions can generally interrogate a person,
and if he has been able to obtain what he considers good control questions, he
then may be able to come up with a conclusion which would indicate whether or
not a person is deceiving or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you describe what you mean by a control question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The control question is the question on which you would expect
the examinee to probably lie, or have some emotional response which can be
used for comparative purposes with regard to the relevant questions of the
interrogation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you give an example of what you mean by control
question, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes, I can.</p>

<p>In a bank embezzlement case, a good control question with an individual
might be, “Have you ever stolen anything in your life that didn’t belong to you?”</p>

<p>In that regard it is expected the person would probably either hedge or deceive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_582">582</span>
and, therefore, the examiner can usually have an indication of whether
or not this person will respond to a deception based on the examinee’s response
to that question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Herndon, what is the policy of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
on the use of the polygraph examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The FBI uses the polygraph technique purely as an investigative
aid, in very carefully selected cases.</p>

<p>As I have said before, we feel that the polygraph technique is not sufficiently
precise to permit absolute judgments of deception or truth without qualifications.
The polygraph technique has a number of limitations which must be considered
by the examiner. The instrument, again, I said before, is designed to record
under proper stimuli emotional responses in the form of physiological variations
which may accompany and indicate deception.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What effect, if any, would there be on a polygraph examination
if the subject were a psychotic depressive with respect to mental condition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. In that particular case, the FBI ordinarily would not render
a polygraph examination to any individual in which there was any indication
or evidence that he was psychotic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What validity would a polygraph examination have on a person
who was a psychotic depressive with respect to the mental condition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The examination would be completely inconclusive or invalid
in view of the fact that a psychotic individual is divorced from reality, and the
tracings on his polygrams could not be logically interpreted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then is it necessary that a person be in touch with reality and
understand the nature of the questions and answers in order for a polygraph
examination to have any validity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes, it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to conduct a polygraph examination on
Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes, I did, on July 18, 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And at whose request was that polygraph examination conducted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The examination of Jack Ruby was conducted at the specific
request of the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>It is my understanding that Mr. Ruby specifically requested such a polygraph
examination to the Commission in a prior interview he had with the Chief
Justice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you present during the course of the entire session when
Mr. Ruby was questioned, both before, during and after the actual administration
of the polygraph examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes, I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And before the test was actually administered, did anyone ask
Mr. Ruby whether he wished to have a polygraph examination conducted on him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes. I believe Mr. Ruby was asked that question by the Commission.
I am not sure of whether the defense attorney specifically asked him
whether or not he wanted to take it, but I know that they were definitely against
him taking the polygraph examination.</p>

<p>In my initial discussion with Mr. Ruby, I again also asked him to sign a voluntary
waiver of consent to insure that he was freely and voluntarily taking the
polygraph examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was Mr. Ruby’s response on the question of whether
he wanted to take the polygraph examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. He clearly implied that he desired to proceed and take the
polygraph examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was it an implication or was it a direct statement on his part
that he wanted the examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. It was a direct statement, and he signed the waiver of consent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was the polygraph examination conducted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The polygraph examination of Jack Ruby was conducted in
one of the rooms in the Dallas county jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was present at the time the examination was conducted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Present during the examination were Mr. Arlen Specter of the
President’s Commission, myself, representing the FBI, Special Agent W. James<span class="pagenum" id="Page_583">583</span>
Wood, of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Dallas, Tex., office, Mr. Ruby’s
attorneys were present, one being chief counsel Mr. Clayton Fowler, another
attorney was present by the name of Mr. Joe Tonahill. Also present during the
examination was a representative of the Dallas district attorney’s office, a Mr.
William Alexander.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he present during the time of the examination or during
the preliminary discussion on questions only?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. He was present during the entire examination except for that
phase in which Mr. Ruby was actually responding to my questions while he was
actually on the instrument.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who else was present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Also present during the entire polygraph proceedings was a Dr.
William Beavers, I believe, of Dallas, Tex., and a chief jailer, I believe his name
was E. L. Holman. There was a court reporter, Odell Oliver, also present during
the proceedings.</p>

<p>Also present during the preliminaries of the proceedings was a gentleman from
the Dallas sheriff’s office by the name of Mr. Sweat, who indicated that he was
a polygraph examiner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was a request made that he not be present during the course of
the examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. After consultation with Mr. Specter and myself, I believe Mr.
Specter made arrangement with the sheriff, Mr. Decker, that Mr. Sweat not be
present during the polygraph examination and further proceedings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the physical arrangement of the room with respect to
Mr. Ruby’s positioning during the time that the polygraph examination was
actually administered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I attempted to arrange Mr. Ruby in such a position that there
would be a minimum of distraction and disturbance to him during the actual
polygraph examination. He was placed rather closely against a wall where
there were no pictures or no distracting marks or implementations on the wall.
I also tried to place him in such a position so that he could not readily see anyone
else who was in the room during the proceedings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you successful in placing him in a position where he could
not see anyone else while the test was being administered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I believe he was in a position that only his secondary vision
from the sides would possibly give him the impression that somebody was in
the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What effect, if any, did the presence of the other people in the
room have on the administration of the test, in your opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Normally during a polygraph examination the only ones in the
room are the examinee and the examiner, and during Bureau proceedings we
usually have another agent in the room out of sight that takes notes. It is
considered an undesirable factor to have many people present in the room during
a polygraph examination, particularly if these people are involved in any way
in the case, such as the defendant’s attorney or someone who has a personal and
keen knowledge in the proceedings. In this particular instance, it appeared to
me that Mr. Ruby divorced the presence of these people from his mind during
his response to the questions. However, it should be considered a factor which
is one that could tend to negate a valid conclusion with regard to chart
interpretation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you taken that factor, then, into account in your evaluation
of chart interpretation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Herndon, did you hear the testimony of Dr. William Beavers
which was taken immediately following the administration of the polygraph
examination commencing at 9:10 p.m., on July 18, 1964?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I heard his testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you hear him testify in a conclusory fashion that: “These
symptoms,” referring to symptoms which he had described, “plus the depression
which was evident caused me to diagnose a psychotic depressive reaction”?
Did you hear him make that diagnosis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_584">584</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. If that diagnosis is accurate, would there be any validity in a
polygraph examination of Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. There would be no validity to the polygraph examination, and
no significance should be placed upon the polygraph charts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you further hear Dr. Beavers testify as follows: “In the
greater proportion of the time that he,” referring to Ruby, “answered the questions,
I felt that he was aware of the questions and that he understood them,
and that he was giving answers based on an appreciation of reality.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I heard him so testify.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. If Mr. Ruby’s mental condition was accurately characterized in
that latter statement, then would the polygraph examination have validity in
accordance with the limitations which you heretofore described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Well, based on the hypothesis that Ruby was mentally competent
and sound, the charts could be interpreted, and if those conditions
are fact, the charts could be interpreted to indicate that there was no area of
deception present with regard to his response to the relevant questions during
the polygraph examination. However, I have no specific information to my
knowledge which would resolve the hypothesis or the suggestion made by Dr.
Beavers that Ruby was in fact rational and fully competent at that time, and,
therefore, I would still have to render an inconclusive opinion with regard to
the charts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say in your last answer if Ruby was competent or
sane, by that do you mean the characteristics which Dr. Beavers described,
stated specifically, that he understood the questions and the answers, that he
was giving answers based on appreciation of reality?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I qualified my answer to the previous question because of the
fact, if you will recall, Dr. Beavers also testified later that it is entirely possible
for a person who is psychotic to still appear to be rational and to be fully
aware of reality. This particular testimony is with regard to specific questions
presented to Dr. Beavers by Mr. Tonahill, and it is a known fact that certain
psychotics at times can appear completely rational and appear to be competent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The distinction on that, though, would be whether or not they
are, in fact, in touch with reality, understanding the nature of the questions
and answers, or whether they only appear to be in touch with reality? Would
that not be the key distinction that Dr. Beavers is making in his testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I am not sure I follow you there, Mr. Specter. Will you repeat
that again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes. You say that Dr. Beavers said that many psychotics appear
to understand the questions or appear to be in touch with reality.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. He said it is possible, I believe, that a psychotic could appear
to be rational and have a good memory, but still be a psychotic individual or
psychotic personality.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; but wasn’t the key distinction that Dr. Beavers was making
was whether or not, in fact, the individual did understand the questions as
opposed to whether he appeared to understand the questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes; I gather from Dr. Beavers’ testimony that in this particular
instance during this particular phase of the examination with regard to
two exceptions which he mentions, Ruby appeared to be fully aware of the
intent and the meaning of the question and was rational in his reply.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But didn’t he go beyond that, Mr. Herndon, that is he did not
use the qualifying term of Mr. Ruby’s appearing to be in touch with reality,
but said, and I will make the portion of the transcript available to you: “I
felt that he was aware of the questions and that he understood them, and that
he was giving answers based on an appreciation of reality.”</p>

<p>Now, you have read that along with me. The distinction I am making here
is that Dr. Beavers doesn’t say here that Mr. Ruby appears to be in touch
with reality, but that he, in fact, is, according to Dr. Beavers’ conclusion,
during the course of this examination, except for two areas which I am going to
come to, that Ruby was, in fact, in touch with reality and did understand the
nature of the questions and answers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I recall he did specifically make that comment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_585">585</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that whatever ultimate conclusions flow from whether Ruby
was psychotic or whether he was in touch with reality are beyond your ken
as a polygraph examiner? You merely rely on what the psychiatrist says in
formulating your conclusions; is that not so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That is correct, Mr. Specter. I would defer to psychiatrists, of
course, with regard to whether or not a person is mentally competent or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that if Mr. Ruby was psychotic, then the polygraph examination
would have no validity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And if, on the other hand, Mr. Ruby was competent and in touch
with reality, understanding the nature of the questions and the content of his
answers, then the polygraph examination would have validity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Under that theory, then the polygraph examination could be
interpreted, and there would be a conclusion rendered, still considering, of
course, all the limitations of the polygraph technique, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, what two areas of questions did Dr. Beavers exclude in
the portion of his answer which you and I just read together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Dr. Beavers made specific reference to two questions which
were originally drafted by himself, Dr. Beavers. These questions were in regard
to whether or not Ruby believed his family were harmed or have been
harmed, whether or not his family have been harmed for what he did, and the
other question was in regard to whether or not he believed his chief counsel,
Mr. Fowler, was in danger for defending him, Ruby, that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And as the record will show, those were the two questions that
Dr. Beavers referred to where he felt Ruby was out of touch with reality when
he answered them during the course of the polygraph examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And focusing for just a moment on those two questions before
we proceed to your conclusions, what answer did Mr. Ruby give to the question
as to whether his family had been harmed as a result of what he did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. During the actual polygraph examination, when that question
was asked, Mr. Ruby failed to respond either yes or no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there any portion of the overall examination which precedes
the time when the machine is activated and the needles are operating, so to
speak?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes. During the pretest interview, the actual questions are
carefully discussed with the examinee, in this case Mr. Ruby, so that he fully
understands the intent and the meaning of the questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is that a normal part of a polygraph examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That is a standard procedure in a polygraph interrogation
technique.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is the purpose for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The purpose of that primarily is to be sure that the examinee
fully understands the question and that there are no problems of surprise or
semantics. It also psychologically conditions the subject in that he commits
himself prior to the test and will be conditioned to know that the question will
be asked again and he will have to make a decision as to how he is going to
answer it, and whether or not he is going to attempt to deceive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what answer did Mr. Ruby give to the question about
whether his family had been harmed as a result of what he did during the course
of the preliminary discussion session?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. To be sure; could we just check the transcript on that? I
believe he did say yes, with regard to that question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Certainly. Please do check the transcript, or your notes, either
way which would be most expeditious. (Pause.) Have you now had an opportunity
to check the transcript on that last answer, Mr. Herndon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes; I have reviewed the transcript, and with regard to both
those questions Mr. Ruby replied “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. During which portion of the examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. This was during the pretest interview.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say he gave “yes” answers to both questions, you mean
the question about “did he think his family had been harmed as a result of what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_586">586</span>
he did,” and also the question about “whether his defense counsel, Mr. Clayton
Fowler, was in danger as a result of representing Mr. Ruby”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes; in both instances he volunteered yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, Mr. Herndon, based on the hypothesis or assumption that
Mr. Ruby was in touch with reality, and understood the nature of the questions,
and the quality of his answers, what opinion did you formulate, if any, as to
patterns of deceptiveness on the relevant questions during the polygraph
examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Based on the hypothesis that you just gave, Mr. Specter, a
review of the polygraph charts would indicate to me, if in fact Ruby was mentally
competent and sane, that there was no indication of deception with regard
to the specific relevant pertinent questions of this investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At this time, Mr. Herndon, I would like to take up the first series
of questions and answers, and ask you to state for the record what they were
and what graph readings you took by way of elaborating upon the conclusion
which you just gave.</p>

<p>For the record I shall mark that first chart as Herndon Deposition Exhibit
No. 1.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Herndon Deposition Exhibit No. 1
for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. As I review the first polygraph chart I notice that I made a
notation at 1 p.m., that Ruby’s attorneys agreed to let Mr. Ruby take the test.
I actually started my adjustments of the instruments on Mr. Ruby at 3 p.m. In
this regard, I believe it proper to state that I was using a Stoelting deceptograph
model 22500 which utilizes three components, the pneumograph, the galvanic
skin response, and the cardiograph. Also utilized during the examination was
a Stoelting polygraph subject chair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe the chair used during the course of this
examination, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The polygraph subject chair is so designed to adjust the level of
the arms and to give complete and full support to the arms. This is necessary
to provide a minimum of restriction or pressure on both of the arms of the
examinee. This is desirable in order to obtain the best possible tracing with
regard to a person’s relative blood pressure changes and relative changes in
the heart rate. It is also desirable to obtain the best possible tracing of the
electrodermal responses or the galvanic skin responses. The chair is also constructed
so that the person will generally refrain from slouching or crossing
his legs during the examination, both of which are undesirable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you now then proceed to testify about the recordings on
the chart?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I also notice with regard to the room that the lighting in the
room was incandescent and not fluorescent, this possibly being a factor in the
tracings with regard to the galvanic skin response. The incandescent lighting
is much preferable, and, therefore, I feel that there was no outside
electrical disturbance with regard to the tracing of the GSR, galvanic skin
response.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you elaborate just a little more on why you think the
lighting would have an effect on the galvanic skin response testing device?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I made a notation of this fact in my notes, in view of the fact
that it has been evident in the past that fluorescent lighting at times has interfered
with proper tracings with regard to the galvanic skin response.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And fluorescent lighting was present here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. No, fluorescent lighting was not present here, and the desirable
or preferable incandescent lighting was present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that that would have a beneficial effect on eliminating a
potential source of interference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Not beneficial, but it would not necessarily hinder the tracing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Fine.</p>

<p>Proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. During my initial adjustments of Mr. Ruby to the polygraph,
I noticed that he had a breathing rate of approximately 21 cycles per minute,
which is well within normal respiratory patterns. I noticed that his heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_587">587</span>
rate was approximately 78 beats per minute, which is well within normal heart
rate of individuals, and that there appeared to be no physical problems with
regard to obtaining a satisfactory cardiogram, which monitors the cardiovascular
system.</p>

<p>During series 1, two relevant questions were asked which were pertinent to the
investigation.</p>

<p>Question No. 4, in which Ruby was asked, “Did you know Oswald before
November 22, 1963?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was his response to that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. To that question he responded, “No,” and an interpretation of
the charts based on the premise that Ruby was mentally sound and competent
would fail to indicate any physiological response which would be suggestive of
deception.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is the basis for your conclusion that there was no
deceptive response elicited to that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. This conclusion is actually based on my interpretation and
study of the overall charts which are still to come up. Actually, in series 1, I
noticed, however, that Mr. Ruby did respond physiologically to a control type
question: “Have you ever been arrested?”</p>

<p>This physiological response was in the form of a rather noticeable rise in his
blood pressure. To this particular question he did answer “Yes,” and later
explained that he had been arrested for dancing after curfew at his own place.</p>

<p>He indicated by his answer that he was somewhat embarrassed by this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that for dancing after curfew or for permitting others to
dance after curfew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I got the interpretation from his comments that it was permitting
dancing, and him also being possibly involved in the party after curfew
hours. This, to me, does indicate, if in fact Ruby was mentally competent, that
he was capable of displaying emotional responses on the polygraph, in this
instance not necessarily deception, but some concern, as portrayed by the relative
rise in blood pressure.</p>

<p>During series 1 Mr. Ruby was also asked another relevant question, question
No. 6, which was pertinent to the investigation, that question being: “Did you
assist Oswald in the assassination?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was his answer to that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. To that question he responded “No,” and if in fact he was
mentally competent at the time he answered that question, the charts could be
interpreted that there was no physiological response to the stimulus of the
question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say “could be interpreted,” Mr. Herndon, do you
mean that that was your opinion or your conclusion as to whether there was a
physiological response?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I wish to qualify my opinion here based on the fact that I am
responding under the hypothesis proposed by you that this chart is being interpreted,
that Ruby is of sound mind, and was rational in his mental process
when responding to this question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Fine.</p>

<p>As I understand it, that is your basic hypothesis or assumption in all of your
answers to interpretation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Fine, if we will keep that in mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes. I think that is fair and I think we have put that on the
record at the start so that whatever you interpret here is based on the assumption
that he was in touch with reality, understood the questions, and knew what he
was answering.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But the point I was coming to was, you said it “could be interpreted”
that there was no pattern of deception, and my concern was whether
there was any deliberate qualification in your answer on “could be interpreted”
or whether it was your positive interpretation that assuming he knew what he
was talking about and was sane, that there was no pattern of deception in his
negative answer on the question of, “Did you assist Oswald in the assassination?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. To answer that question, Mr. Specter, I would have to go back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_588">588</span>
to my original statement that the polygraph technique is not considered precise
enough to make absolute statements of deception or nondeception, so, therefore,
any time I make any observation it would be using probably a qualified word
such as “appeared to indicate deception” or “suggestive of deception,” keeping in
mind that, of course, there are many emotional responses that I am not in a
position to evaluate, such as fear of being falsely accused, dislike for the people
in the room, other factors which may tend to negate positive statements that
here in fact this thing is meaning he is not lying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On that particular question, were there any indicators at all
that he was deceiving in his answer to question No. 6, to wit: “Did you assist
Oswald in the assassination?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Other than a slight impact in the GSR, there was no noticeable
change in his physiological responses to that particular question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was the slight impact that you referred to in the
GSR, meaning galvanic skin response?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The impact here not being significant enough to make any
specific evaluation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then were there any other relevant questions in the first series?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. There were no other relevant questions in the first series.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there anything else in the first series which is significant
enough to comment on by way of analysis of the overall examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. No other than to say that the total chart minutes for series 1
was 2 minutes 25 seconds in duration of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there any fixed limitation on how long a series can run?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes, it is generally conceded that a person should not be run
on the polygraph beyond perhaps 4 minutes, inasmuch as after that time the
pressure on the arm cuff can become discomforting and irritating to the examinee.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that there was a question here of possible effect on
Ruby’s health, I attempted to maintain all my questioning within an approximate
3-minute period to insure no damaging effect on his physical condition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there any overall limitation on the amount of time that a
person can appropriately take a polygraph examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes, there is a limitation. Certainly if a person is interviewed
with polygraph at great length, in due time he is bound to become desensitized
to the technique. In other words, the pressure on his arm and the technique
itself becomes less valid as the increase in time proceeds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Mr. Ruby ever become desensitized to the technique?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I believe in the last series of the first session, which I believe
is series 4, Mr. Ruby showed some indications of becoming fatigued and displayed
some tiredness in the charts. Also, I might add in the latter phase of
the examination, in the latter series, there was some indication that he was
approaching this desensitization that I have mentioned before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now given us all the relevant findings from series of 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I think so. There might be one other thing I will just mention
here, and that is in question 5 with regard to, “Do you use the middle name
Leon” there were some noticeable changes in the physiological tracings. However,
these were caused by his laughter and talking in which he later explained
that he sometimes used the name, but other times he doesn’t, and that the
name Leon is sentimental to him. That is the only other noticeable variance
in his normal tracing that I wish to comment on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let us then proceed now to series 2 and mark that Herndon
Deposition Exhibit No. 2, if we may, please.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Herndon Deposition Exhibit No. 2
for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, referring to that chart, what significant findings were there
on that chart?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The only significant change physiologically during series No. 2
was in Mr. Ruby’s response to the question, “Have you ever been known by
another name?”, as portrayed by an increase in his blood pressure. He answered
this question with both a yes and a no, and after the series was completed
there was some discussion with regard to the question. He mentioned
that he was uncertain how to answer the question because he had originally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_589">589</span>
used the name of Jack Rubenstein and that he had legally changed it at a later
date. Other than some variations in the pneumograph which were caused
by his hesitating to answer due to the length of the questions provided, there
is no other significant physiological change noticed in series 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what were the relevant questions in series 2?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The relevant questions in series 2 were No. 3 “Are you now a
member of the Communist Party?” in which there was no significant physiological
change.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was his response there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. He responded “No,” to that question.</p>

<p>On question No. 5, which is considered relevant, he was asked, “Have you
ever been a member of the Communist Party?” He responded “No,” and there
is no significant response recorded. There is an adjustment on my behalf of the
cardiogram tracing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What do you mean by that, Mr. Herndon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Where this arrow is placed, and I brought down the tracing
to a lower level so that I could see if there would be any subsequent rise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was it a consistent tracing thereafter indicating no
deviation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes. The cardiogram is interpreted as being consistent, and no
significant change or deviation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, what other relevant questions were asked in that series?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Question 7, “Are you now a member of any group that advocates
the violent overthrow of the U.S. Government?” There is no significant
change in his relative blood pressure, and the only change significant in his
breathing pattern which by chart interpretation was caused by him hesitating
to answer the question due to its length.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was his response to that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. He responded “No” to question No. 7.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there any other relevant questions in that group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Question No. 8 was relevant. It was, “Have you ever been
a member of any group that advocates the violent overthrow of the U.S. Government?”
Here, again, he responded “No.” There was no significant change.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you start that again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Question No. 8 was “Have you ever been a member of any
group that advocates the violent overthrow of the U.S. Government?”</p>

<p>This is a relatively long question for polygraph technique, and I note that
there was some hesitation in the pneumograph tracing, in view of the fact he
had to wait for the question to be completed before he could respond. He
eventually did respond “No” and there was no significant change in his
physiological tracings. The total chart minutes, that is the time that he was
actually on the polygraph from the beginning to the end of this particular series,
was 2 minutes 30 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there any other relevant questions in that group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. There were no other relevant questions in that group.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there any other significant findings in that portion of
the test on series No. 2?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. There was a control question “did you ever make a false official
statement” to which he responded “No.” There was a very minor change in the
cardiograph tracing as portrayed by a slight decrease in the relative blood
pressure. However, it is not considered significant enough to make any
additional statements.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now you have given us all the relevant findings for series No. 2;
is that correct, Mr. Herndon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let us now proceed to the next series and mark the next series
as Herndon Deposition Exhibit No. 3.</p>

<p>(Herndon Deposition Exhibit No. 3 was marked for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you start off on the third series, Mr. Herndon, by telling
us what were the relevant questions and the responses thereto, if any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. During series 3, there were three relevant questions asked.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_590">590</span>
No. 3: “Between the assassination and the shooting, did anybody you know
tell you they knew Oswald?”</p>

<p>He responded “No,” and there was no significant physiological change recorded
on the polygraph. There is a noticeable change in the pneumograph pattern.
However, this has been interpreted again as being caused by the relatively long
length of this particular question.</p>

<p>Question No. 5 was: “Aside from anything you said to George Senator on
Sunday morning, did you ever tell anyone else that you intended to shoot
Oswald?” In comparison to his overall chart, there is nothing of particular
significance in his physiological responses to this question, when he responded
“No” to question 5.</p>

<p>Question No. 8 was: “Did you shoot Oswald in order to silence him?” This
again being a relevant question. He responded “No.” There was no significant
deviation in his physiological responses to this question.</p>

<p>During series 3 he was asked two control-type questions in which he did respond
significantly with regard to the physiological tracings. Question No. 4 was
asked: “Are you married?” Mr. Ruby responded “No.” An interpretation of his
polygrams reveal a rather significant rise in his relative blood pressure. He also
produced a rather vivid impact on the GSR tracings, and there was noticeable
staircase suppression in his pneumograph pattern. This question was later discussed
with Mr. Ruby, and he said that he was thinking of a young girl by the
name of Alice Nichols who he had previously considered marrying. He admitted
that he felt something “working on him,” with regard to this particular question.
An analysis of this question would indicate that Ruby did emotionally respond
to the stimulus of the question “Are you married,” and his thoughts of a former
sweetheart. This does not indicate that there was any deception of course, but
does suggest Mr. Ruby does respond physiologically to certain emotions that he
feels when he hears the questions and decides how to answer them. In a sense
this is a control-type question. Also in this series, in question No. 7, Mr. Ruby
was asked: “While in the service did you receive any disciplinary action?” There
is a noticeable rise in his blood pressure after he responded “No.” This question
had been discussed rather thoroughly with him, and after the series was run, he
admitted that he had been called in before his commanding officer regarding a
brawl he had while in the military service. He also commented: “Evidently you
are getting a good reading.” This could be interpreted as a deception pattern inasmuch
as in his mind he realized he had been in some trouble in the military
service; however, did not want to truthfully answer the question as he considered
it insignificant.</p>

<p>However, he did admit that he had been in some trouble with his commanding
officer regarding fighting. This is considered a control question, and its response
is greater than his response to the previous relevant question which I had related.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would there be any difference in psychological reactions, Mr.
Herndon, on a pattern of deception which the subject considered insignificant as
opposed to a pattern of deception which the subject considered significant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Generally the concept of the polygraph technique is that we are
attempting to find out what a man’s physiological responses will be in any area
where he is attempting to deceive. The content of the actual deception is not
particularly important. We want to get a tracing of where he is attempting to
deceive. Now under a situation such as Mr. Ruby was in here, it is more probable
that he is more concerned about these relevant questions than these irrelevant
or control-type questions. In other words, the relevant questions have more to do
with his well-being or what he is trying to prove to the Commission. However,
the chart here still shows that he attempted to deceive with regard to what he
considered insignificant, but it tends to indicate to me that he will respond to a
practice of deception, if that answers your question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What I am driving at here is whether there is any gage in whether
he considers it insignificant or significant in the reading. Stated differently,
there would be a response even though he might consider a question to be
insignificant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That is right. If there is an attempt on his part to practice
deception, if he again, as I say, is competent and reasoning rationally. In general
practice of polygraph work, generally speaking the control questions are of lesser<span class="pagenum" id="Page_591">591</span>
severity than the actual pertinent questions, but in those cases where the person
appears to be telling the truth, we find that they will respond more to the control
questions than the critical question, even though the critical question has more
potency and is more severe with regard to his well-being.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there any other significant findings on that chart?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes. Mr. Ruby also responded significantly in a physiological
sense with regard to question 9: “Have you ever served time in jail?” He failed
to actually respond yes or no. However, there was a decrease in his blood pressure,
a moderate impact in the GSR, and a change in the baseline of his pneumograph
tracing. The fact that he actually failed to say yes or no precludes my
interpretation of whether or not this is an indication of deception, but it does
indicate that Ruby did experience a physiological variation from his normal
pattern with regard to this question which is of a control-type nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Does that complete then the relevant findings on that chart?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That concludes series No. 3. It might be worthwhile to record
that the total chart minutes on this particular series was 2 minutes 45 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let us then mark the next series, which is series 3a, as Herndon
Deposition Exhibit No. 4.</p>

<p>(Herndon Deposition Exhibit No. 4 was marked for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you start there on series 3a with the relevant questions,
the responses and your evaluation of any significant psychological deviation,
please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. This particular series 3a was what would be called a modified
peak of tension series. Ruby was carefully instructed prior to the series that four
relevant questions were going to be asked in a consecutive order.</p>

<p>Question No. 3: “Did you first decide to shoot Oswald on Friday night?”
He responded “No.”</p>

<p>Question No. 4: “Did you first decide to shoot Oswald on Saturday morning?”
He responded “No.”</p>

<p>Question No. 5: “Did you first decide to shoot Oswald Saturday night?”
He responded “No.”</p>

<p>Question No. 6: “Did you first decide to shoot Oswald Sunday morning?”
He responded “Yes.”</p>

<p>These are the only relevant questions in this series. A review of the chart
with regard to his responses in this series reveals that Ruby’s blood pressure
continually rose from the question No. 3 until it reached a peak just as question
No. 6 was asked. In addition it was noted that there was a rather noticeable
change in his breathing pattern as question No. 6 was approached. There
is a slight impact in the GSR tracing as question No. 6 is approached. This
would mean to me in interpreting the chart that Ruby reached a peak of
tension as the question No. 6 was about to be asked in which he responded “Yes”
to “Did you first decide to shoot Oswald Sunday morning?” This particular
type of series cannot be interpreted with regard to whether or not there was
any deception, but it does indicate that Ruby built up a physiological peak
of tension to the time of Sunday morning with regard to his decision of shooting
Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there any correlation between the building up of a peak of
tension and the accurate answer to the series?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. In normal usage of polygraph technique where a peak of
tension is used, if the series is effective, the party will usually respond to a
particular item which happens to be the most pertinent with regard to the
offense. In this case it appears that Ruby projected his entire thoughts and
built up a physiological peak of tension to the point of Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are there any other significant readings on Exhibit No. 4?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. There is no other significant reading on series 4. The total
chart minutes was 2 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let’s move on then to series No. 4 and we will mark that as
Herndon Deposition Exhibit No. 5.</p>

<p>(Herndon Deposition Exhibit No. 5 was marked for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I will ask you to start on that one, Mr. Herndon, by giving us
the relevant questions and answers to those relevant questions and the responses,
if any?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_592">592</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I believe this is series No. 4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; series No. 4, and we have marked it as Exhibit No. 5. We
are one out of number now since we have used an “A” series.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. In series No. 4, Mr. Ruby was asked four relevant questions.</p>

<p>Question No. 2: “Were you on the sidewalk at the time Lieutenant Pierce’s
car stopped on the ramp exit?” He responded “Yes.”</p>

<p>Question No. 4: “Did you enter the jail by walking through the alleyway?”
Mr. Ruby responded “No.”</p>

<p>Question No. 6: “Did you walk past the guard at the time Lieutenant Pierce’s
car was parked on the ramp exit?” Mr. Ruby replied “Yes.”</p>

<p>Question No. 8: “Did you talk with any Dallas police officer on Sunday,
November 24, prior to shooting Oswald?” Mr. Ruby replied “No.”</p>

<p>With regard to chart interpretation on this particular series of questions, it
is difficult to interpret because this is the first series where Mr. Ruby tends to
show a little fatigue in that he took several deep breaths, could not refrain
from moving his foot and the rest of his body, and, in general, the chart is
relatively difficult to interpret.</p>

<p>However, considering these body motions and his irregular breathing, there
appear to be no significant physiological variations with regard to his response
to the relevant questions as projected in that series. There is one question in
which he displayed a moderate rise of blood pressure, and that was in regard
to an irrelevant question No. 5: “Are your parents alive?” In which he stated
“No.” He was questioned about this after the series was over, and he advised
that he felt a little nervous during this series, but that particular question
didn’t give him any trouble. His breathing is quite irregular throughout this
series, and I have a notation on my chart that I advised Mr. Specter that
Mr. Ruby was beginning to show some signs of fatigue, and it was mutually
agreed that we would have a recess at this point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did that recess last, Mr. Herndon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. This particular series began according to my charts at 4:35
p.m., and the next subsequent series began at 6:48 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now given us all the important findings on series 4?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let’s move on now then to series No. 5 and mark that as
Herndon Deposition Exhibit No. 6.</p>

<p>(Herndon Deposition Exhibit No. 6 was marked for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I will ask you to start with the relevant questions again, and
give us the answers and any significant physiological deviation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. This particular series which my notes refer to as series No. 5
began at 6:48, and Mr. Ruby was asked four relevant questions.</p>

<p>Question No. 2: “Did you see the armored truck before you entered the basement?”
He replied “No.”</p>

<p>Question No. 4: “Did you enter the police department through a door at the
rear on the east side of the jail?” He responded “No.”</p>

<p>Question No. 6: “After talking to Little Lynn did you hear any announcement
that Oswald was about to be moved?” He responded “No.”</p>

<p>Question No. 8: “Before you left your apartment Sunday morning, did anyone
tell you the armored car was on the way to the police department?” He replied
“No.”</p>

<p>The one particular thing of interest with regard to overall interpretation of
this chart is how Ruby showed considerable more relaxation and appeared to
be completely at ease after the recess. There was no physiological variation
of any significance noted with regard to his replies to the relevant questions.
There is some deviation with regard to his pneumograph tracing at question
No. 7, which is considered a control-type question. This question was: “Other
than what you told me, did you ever hit anyone with any kind of a weapon?”
He responded to this question by talking. However, he later asked that the
question be repeated. The question was repeated during the series, and he
responded “No.” The only significant deviation from his normal pattern was
recorded in the pneumograph, and this was caused by his talking in response
to the question the first time it was asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_593">593</span>
There is nothing else significant noted in series No. 5.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let’s proceed then to series No. 6 and we will mark that as
Herndon Deposition Exhibit No. 7.</p>

<p>(Herndon Deposition Exhibit No. 7 was marked for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Do you want the total chart minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; please give us that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The total chart minutes of series 5 was 2 minutes 55 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show now that we have marked series No. 6
as Herndon Exhibit No. 7. Would you now, Mr. Herndon, specify the relevant
questions, responses, and psychological deviations, if any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. In series No. 6 Mr. Ruby was asked four relevant questions.</p>

<p>No. 2: “Did you get a Wall Street Journal at Southwestern Drug Store during
the week before the assassination?” He replied “No.”</p>

<p>Question No. 4: “Do you have any knowledge of a Wall Street Journal addressed
to a Mr. J. E. Bradshaw?”</p>

<p>He replied “No.”</p>

<p>Question No. 6: “To your knowledge did you or any of your friends telephone
the FBI in Dallas between 2 and 3 a.m. Sunday morning?” He replied “No.”</p>

<p>Question No. 8: “Did you or any of your friends to your knowledge telephone
the sheriff’s office between 2 or 3 a.m. Sunday morning?” He replied “No.”</p>

<p>From a review of Mr. Ruby’s polygrams, on series 6, it was noted that there
were no significant physiological variations to his response to the relevant questions.
It was noted that Mr. Ruby did display slight suppression in his breathing
pattern, and a relative decrease in blood pressure with an increase in the
heart amplitude at question No. 7. This question was: “Did you ever overcharge
a customer?” Mr. Ruby replied “No.” However, after the series, this
question was discussed with him briefly, and he did make mention of the fact
that there had been some trouble at his nightclub with regard to the waitresses
and big bills. This could be interpreted as a possible deception pattern in that
he hedged with regard to the question “Did you ever overcharge a customer.”
The total chart minutes of series No. 6 was 2 minutes 50 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are there any other significant findings on series 6?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The only significant finding being that the control question 7
displays a more significant variation than his response to the relevant questions.
There are no others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You have now given us then all the significant findings on
series 6?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that we are now placing the designation
Herndon Deposition Exhibit No. 8 on series No. 7.</p>

<p>(Herndon Deposition Exhibit No. 8 was marked for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you start again, Mr. Herdon, with the relevant questions
and tell us the answers and the responses thereto with any significant findings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Series No. 7 contains four relevant questions.</p>

<p>Question No. 2: “Did you go to the Dallas police station at any time on Friday,
November 22, 1963, before you went to the synagogue?” Mr. Ruby replied “No.”</p>

<p>Question No. 4: “Did you go to the synagogue that Friday night?” Mr. Ruby
replied “Yes.”</p>

<p>Question No. 6: “Did you see Oswald in the Dallas jail on Friday night?”
Mr. Ruby replied “Yes.”</p>

<p>Question No. 8: “Did you have a gun with you when you went to the Friday
midnight press conference at the jail?” Mr. Ruby replied “No.”</p>

<p>There was one other question asked which I consider irrelevant. However,
it is of value to the series, and I will make mention of it, question No. 9:
“Is everything you told the Warren Commission the entire truth?” Mr. Ruby
responded “Yes.”</p>

<p>With regard to overall interpretation of series No. 7, I first noticed there is
a physiological deviation to Mr. Ruby’s response to question No. 1 which was
“Do you intend to answer the questions truthfully.” However, my notes indicate
that Mr. Ruby talked and said “Yes, I do,” and by actually speaking several
words it is believed that this caused the variation in the tracings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_594">594</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will movement or speaking cause a variation in the tracings
ordinarily, Mr. Herndon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes. Body movements or speaking any phrase or sentence
would certainly cause changes in the physiological patterns as displayed on the
polygraph. I made notation of that, however, and that explains the changes.
On question No. 2, Mr. Ruby did show a significant drop in the relative blood
pressure. This question pertained to: “Did you go to the Dallas police station
at any time on Friday November 22, 1963, before you went to the synagogue?”
I asked him about this question later when he responded “No,” and I noticed
a physiological change. He advised that there was some man by the name
of John Rutledge, and he made an association with proceedings at the trial
which I have reason to believe this gentleman, John Rutledge, differed somewhat
with what Ruby stated as to when he went to the synagogue.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of this change, however, it is possible that it was caused
by a body motion that I failed to detect during the actual response.</p>

<p>I notice that the cardio pen dropped all the way down and hit what we call
the limit screws. This frequently is caused by a sudden rapid shift in his body
position, and this change could have been caused by a body movement.</p>

<p>With regard to the other relevant questions in this series, question 4, question
6, and question 8, there was no significant deviation from his normal physiological
patterns.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there any other significant findings, in series No. 7?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. There was a significant change in his breathing pattern and
also a slight decrease in his blood pressure when I asked him the question “Did
you attend the synagogue regularly?”</p>

<p>However, this is a control type question, and as later discussed with him,
there was some area of doubt in his mind as to whether he attended the
synagogue regularly as much as he would like to. The total chart minutes on
series 7 was 2 minutes 55 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now given all the relevant findings on chart No. 7?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes, I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that I have affixed Herndon Deposition
Exhibit No. 9 to series No. 8.</p>

<p>(Herndon Deposition Exhibit No. 9 was marked for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I hand it to you with the request that you give us the findings
there starting with the relevant questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Series No. 8 contained five relevant questions.</p>

<p>No. 2: “Have you ever knowingly attended any meetings of the Communist
Party or any other group that advocates violent overthrow of the Government?”
Mr. Ruby replied “No.”</p>

<p>I notice in the pneumograph tracing some deviation. However, by interpretation
of the chart and the length of that particular question, it again appears
obvious that there was some hesitation on his part in answering the question
due to its length.</p>

<p>However, there was no other noticeable significant physiological deviation in
his response to that question.</p>

<p>Question No. 4: “Is any of your immediate family or any close friend a
member of the Communist Party?” Mr. Ruby replied “No” and there is no
significant change in his normal physiological pattern.</p>

<p>Question No. 6: “Is any of your immediate family or any close friend a
member of any group that advocates the violent overthrow of the Government?”
This again is a relatively long question. However, it did not appear to disturb
him, and there is no noticable physiological deviation in his response to this
question.</p>

<p>Question No. 8: “Did any close friend or any member of your immediate
family ever attend a meeting of the Communist Party?” Mr. Ruby replied “No.”</p>

<p>Here again there is no noticable significant deviation in his physiological
pattern.</p>

<p>Question No. 9: “Did any close friend or any member of your immediate
family ever attend a meeting of any group that advocates the violent overthrow
of the Government?” Here again this is a relatively long question and there
was a little hesitation on his part in answering it, causing a change in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_595">595</span>
pneumograph tracing. However, there is no significant deviation with regard
to his overall physiological pattern when he responded to this question. In
general, series 8 shows no significant deviation from his normal physiological
pattern. The total chart minutes was 2 minutes 50 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You have now then given us all of the relevant findings on series
No. 8, correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I now hand you the chart designated series No. 9 marked
Herndon Deposition Exhibit No. 10, and ask you if there was any unique
system employed in that series.</p>

<p>(Herndon Deposition Exhibit No. 10 was marked for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes, there was at this point in the interrogation. Realizing the
Commission had a large number of questions they wanted to ask, it was decided
at this point, in view of the fact that we had asked the main critical questions,
to proceed with what I call direct interrogation, that is that each and every
one of the questions asked is a relevant question, and that there are no irrelevant
questions or control questions asked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you proceed then to give us the results of those questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Did you want me to itemize each and every one of these questions
or read them out? They are all relevant questions and a matter of record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, please do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Series 9 contains 7 questions, all being relevant.</p>

<p>Question No. 1: “Did you ever meet Oswald at your post office box?” Mr.
Ruby replied “No.”</p>

<p>Question No. 2: “Did you use your post office mail box to do any business
with Mexico or Cuba?” Mr. Ruby replied “No.”</p>

<p>Question No. 3: “Did you do business with Castro Cuba?” Mr. Ruby replied
“No.”</p>

<p>Question No. 4: “Was your trip to Cuba solely for pleasure?”</p>

<p>Mr. Ruby replied “Yes.”</p>

<p>Question No. 5: “Have you now told us the truth concerning why you carried
$2,200 in cash on you?” Mr. Ruby replied “Yes.”</p>

<p>Question No. 6: “Did any foreign influence cause you to shoot Oswald?” Mr.
Ruby replied “No.”</p>

<p>Question No. 7: “Did you shoot Oswald because of any influence of the underworld?”
Mr. Ruby replied “No.”</p>

<p>In interpreting his chart with regard to this particular series of questions,
there is no noticeable significant deviation in his physiological pattern except
at question No. 6. According to my notation on the chart, Ruby moved his
head at this point, and there was a deviation caused by this movement in his
blood pressure tracing and also in his pneumograph tracing. His heart rate
maintained a consistent rate of approximately 66 to 72 heart beats per minute
throughout this series. No significant changes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the total time on that series?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. The total chart minutes on series 9 was 2 minutes 15 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now given us all the relevant factors from that series
reading?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let the record show that you are going to proceed with series
9A which is a continuation of the sheet marked Herndon Exhibit No. 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. This was done in order to save time inasmuch as the interrogation
was becoming rather lengthy at this point, and Mr. Specter indicated he
was anxious to proceed and to complete the rest of the questions that we had
agreed upon with all those parties that were interested in this interrogation.</p>

<p>Series No. 9A again is a series of relevant questions.</p>

<p>Question No. 8: “Did you shoot Oswald because of labor union influence?”
Mr. Ruby replied “No.”</p>

<p>Question No. 9: “Did any long distance telephone calls which you made before
the assassination of the President have anything to do with the assassination?”
Mr. Ruby replied “No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_596">596</span>
Question No. 10: “Did any of your long distance telephone calls concern the
shooting of Oswald?” Mr. Ruby replied “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What number question was that again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Question No. 10.</p>

<p>Question No. 11: “Did you shoot Oswald in order to save Mrs. Kennedy the
ordeal of a trial?” Mr. Ruby replied “Yes.”</p>

<p>Question No. 12: “Did you know the Tippit that was killed?” Mr. Ruby
replied “No.”</p>

<p>Question No. 13: “Did you tell the truth about relaying the message to Ray
Brantley to get McWillie a few guns?” Mr. Ruby replied “Yes.”</p>

<p>Question No. 14: “Did you go to the assembly room on Friday night to get
the telephone number of KLIF?” Mr. Ruby replied “Yes.”</p>

<p>Question No. 15: “Did you ever meet with Oswald and Tippit at your club?”
Mr. Ruby replied “No.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On the designations series 9 and 9A, Mr. Herndon, did you
loosen up the cuff on his arm during the two series?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes; I deliberately loosened or actually I completely took off
all pressure off his arm to allow him to have complete circulation in his arm
and to give him a rest period before proceeding with series 9A. I believe the
transcript will show that I asked him if he was feeling all right and if he was
ready to proceed before going into series 9A. A review of series 9A with regard
to Ruby’s polygrams fails to reveal any significant physiological reaction
with regard to his responses to these relevant questions.</p>

<p>At this point, Mr. Specter, I might add that we are getting into an area now
where it is possible that Ruby is getting somewhat cuff weary and getting
somewhat tired and becoming somewhat immune to the polygraph technique.
I believe we both realized this.</p>

<p>However, we wanted to ask these questions as a matter of record. The chart
shows there is no stress or strain. However, it is entirely possible that he is
becoming desensitized at this point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now given us all the relevant findings on series 9a?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes; the total chart minutes for this particular series was 2
minutes 30 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I now hand you series No. 10 which is marked Herndon Deposition
Exhibit No. 11, and ask you to start again with the relevant questions and
give us the responses thereto and any significant findings.</p>

<p>(Herndon Deposition Exhibit No. 11 was marked for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Series No. 10 again was mutually agreed upon by several of
the people present during the examination. However, formally authorized by
Mr. Specter of the President’s Commission. They are question No. 2 which is
relevant: “Were you at the Parkland Hospital any time on Friday?” Mr. Ruby
replied, “No.”</p>

<p>Question No. 3, which is considered relevant. “Did you say anything when
you shot Oswald other than what you testified about?”</p>

<p>Mr. Ruby replied, “No.”</p>

<p>Question No. 4, which was originally recommended by Dr. Beavers and as
agreed upon by Mr. Specter, was presented in this manner.</p>

<p>Question No. 4: “Have members of your family been physically harmed because
of what you did?” Mr. Ruby—could we go off the record here? I am
a little confused on my notes at this point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that while off the record, Mr. Herndon
has referred to his notes and also to the transcript of testimony taken by the
court reporter at the time the polygraph examination was administered, to
be sure of the questions and answers here, and that as Mr. Herndon points
out, his notes correspond with the transcript.</p>

<p>Will you then proceed Mr. Herndon to state those questions, answers and
responses, if any?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_597">597</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes; No. 4 was: “Have members of your family been physically
harmed because of what you did?” Mr. Ruby did reply “No,” and then said:
“May I interrupt?” He was instructed by me to just sit perfectly still and
we will discuss the questions later. There was a deviation in his physiological
tracings with regard to this question. However, these must be interpreted to the
fact that he actually spoke a sentence in response to the question.</p>

<p>Question No. 5 was: “Do you think members of your family are now in
danger because of what you did?” Mr. Ruby failed to make any reply or response
to this particular question. It is noted that there was no significant
change in his physiological tracings in any of the components following my
asking this question.</p>

<p>Question No. 6 was: “Is Mr. Fowler in danger because he is defending you?”
Here again Mr. Ruby failed to make any verbal reply to the question. Looking
at the polygrams produced, it is noted that there is no significant physiological
response with regard to this question. The examiner made a notation on his
chart that it appeared that Mr. Ruby was visibly pondering the answer to
these questions. However, decided not to answer them as instructed either
yes or no period.</p>

<p>Question No. 7 is a relevant question: “Did Blackie Harrison speak to you
just before you shot Oswald?” Mr. Ruby replied “No” and there is a slight
increase in his relative blood pressure. However, this is not considered significant
inasmuch as it is at the end of the series, and it is not unusual for slight
increase in blood pressure to be portrayed as the series prolongs into the later
questions. It is not considered significant.</p>

<p>The total chart minutes on this particular series was 2 minutes 25 seconds.</p>

<p>In discussion of the two questions in which Mr. Ruby failed to reply, I made
notations on the chart that he felt the questions were difficult to answer yes
or no, and that he didn’t know how to answer them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. By those questions do you mean the <span class="locked">ones——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I am referring to question 5 and 6 in which he did not specifically
reply verbally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That is “Do you think members of your family are now in
danger because of what you did?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And “Is Mr. Fowler in danger because he is defending you?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Mr. Ruby answer those in a preliminary session?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. During the preliminary session he did answer those questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What answer to each question did he give?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. To the question “Do you think members of your family are
now in danger because of what you did?” he replied “Yes.”</p>

<p>In regard to the question “Is Mr. Fowler in danger because he is defending
you?” Mr. Ruby replied “Yes.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now given all the significant findings on series No. 10?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I will now move to series No. 11 which we will mark for this
record as Herndon Deposition Exhibit No. 12.</p>

<p>(Herndon Deposition Exhibit No. 12 was marked for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you start on series No. 11, giving the relevant questions,
answers and any physiological deviation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. These questions on Series 11 were primarily asked after a conversation
between Mr. Ruby and Mr. Specter at which time Mr. Ruby indicated
he wanted some additional questions asked of him.</p>

<p>It was finally agreed upon that we would ask the three following questions.</p>

<p>No. 1 just to establish identity “Are you Jack Ruby?” in which he replied
“Yes.”</p>

<p>Question No. 2: “Do you consider yourself to be a 100-percent American
patriot?” Mr. Ruby responded “Yes.”</p>

<p>And question No. 3 “Is all of the testimony given by you today the complete
truth?” Mr. Ruby replied “Yes.”</p>

<p>This particular series began at 8:57 p.m., and a review of the physiological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_598">598</span>
responses to these three particular questions indicate that they are not significant.
It is believed by the examiner at this point, although Mr. Ruby said he was
not tired in his general conversation with the examiner, that he was probably
somewhat fatigued, and he was no longer displaying the usual physiological
responses expected during the earlier phases of the examination.</p>

<p>The total chart minutes of series 11 is 1 minute 10 seconds. I do not consider
anything significant to these particular responses other than the fact that we
obliged Mr. Ruby in asking them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was this polygraph examination excessive with respect to length
in your opinion, Mr. Herndon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Well, it would greatly depend on Mr. Ruby’s physical and mental
condition of course. A doctor was in attendance during the examination,
and I repeatedly asked Mr. Ruby during the examination how he felt and
whether he wanted to proceed. I asked him on several occasions if he would
like to take a break or have a drink of water. I cannot specifically state
that it did or did not appear to hinder his health or cause him any undue
fatigue.</p>

<p>However, I did hear the doctor indicate that there was no undue physical
stress or strain on Mr. Ruby during the examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Up until the points where you have indicated there were some
signs of tiredness, did Mr. Ruby appear to be responding in a satisfactory
manner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. I would say during the first several series of questions, and
based on the presumption again that Mr. Ruby was rationally sound and competent
during this phase of the examination, that he responded very normally,
and the polygraph examination proceeded without any technical difficulties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was Mr. Ruby given periodic breaks throughout the course of
the examination in addition to that lengthy one between series 4 and series 5?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes; he was given a number of breaks and there was no
time when he was asked a long series of questions inasmuch as the
total chart, minutes on my charts indicate none of them went beyond 3 minutes,
which is certainly considered well within standard series total chart minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add which you think would be helpful
to the President’s Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Herndon</span>. Yes. I would like to make a few additional comments with
regard to this polygraph examination, in view of the fact that it was somewhat
unique and unusual. I think these factors should be somewhat considered in
the overall evaluation of the polygraph examination.</p>

<p>First of all, Ruby has obviously been extensively interviewed by law enforcement
officers and by the Commission and other people, and there has been
a considerable length of time lapse since the time that the instant offense
occurred of him shooting Oswald. These factors of length of time and considerable
previous interrogation would tend to detract or negate any specific
or definite conclusion that could be rendered with regard to the polygraph
examination.</p>

<p>The fact that there were other personnel in the room would tend to negate
a valid polygraph technique. However, here again I did mention that this did
not appear to bother Mr. Ruby. But it should be considered and made a
matter of record.</p>

<p>One other point I would like to mention, and that is the large number of
relevant questions asked Mr. Ruby during this particular examination. This
is not general standard procedure. However, I realize that the President’s
Commission wanted to cover many facets, and that it was mutually agreed upon
that we would ask the questions that the Commission had originally drawn up
for this particular interrogation. In normal polygraph procedure it is usual
to keep the relevant questions down to perhaps several specific critical relevant
questions and work strictly on those, and in this particular examination we
had a large number of relevant questions to ask.</p>

<p>I think these are all factors that should be considered in the overall evaluation of
Mr. Ruby’s polygraph examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much, Mr. Herndon.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="WALL">TESTIMONY OF BRECK WALL (BILLY RAY WILSON)</h2>
</div>

<p>The testimony of Breck Wall was taken at 2:13 p.m., on August 5, 1964, at the
U.S. Post Office Building, 301 Stewart Street, Las Vegas, Nev., by Mr. Arlen
Specter, assistant counsel of the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that this deposition proceeding of the
President’s Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy is being
taken at the U.S. Post Office Building, 301 Stewart Street, Las Vegas, Nev.
May the record further show it is now 2:13 Pacific daylight time on Wednesday,

a friend of mine signed the receipt on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Under the regulations you are entitled to 3 days’ notice. Are
you willing to proceed with this deposition today without having that notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where were you born?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_600">600</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Jacksonville, Fla.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where did you live, in a general way, up to the present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Well, I have lived in Freeport, Tex., that is where I was raised,
and Dallas, New York City, Jacksonville, Fla., Orlando, Fla., and here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you live in New York City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. In 1954 through 1957.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was your occupation at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I worked as a doorman at Luchow’s on 14th Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you live at those various cities in Florida?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. In between—in the year of 1957 and 1958. I came to Dallas in
November of 1958, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When was it specifically that you lived in Florida then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. It was in the first part of 1958 and the latter part of 1957, I would
say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when did you live in Freeman, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Freeport.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Freeport, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Through school until I graduated in 1953.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. From high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then you attended the University of Texas in Austin for a year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where did you live from 1954 until the time you went to
New York City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Then New York City from Austin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you go directly from Austin to New York City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you go directly from New York City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. To Jacksonville, Fla.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where you lived for the balance of the time up until November
of 1958?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Right; sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you went to Dallas, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do when you first went to Dallas in November of
1958?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I was ill at the time and I had to stay with the McKennas. I was
sick at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where do the McKennas live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Currently they live in Galveston, Tex. They moved from Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What are the first names of the McKennas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Thomas J. McKenna.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is there another McKenna?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. There are—you mean as far as children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You say you lived with the McKennas. I take it there was
more than one McKenna or was there only one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Mrs. McKenna and three children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how long did you stay with them following the time you
joined them in November of 1958?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I would say about 2 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you next live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I can’t think of the name of the street. In Dallas. I lived in
Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. With others, or by yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. By myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did you happen to know the McKennas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. When I was going to high school, I would spend the summer with
my family and they lived next door to my family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when you spent the summer with your family who lived
next door to the McKennas, was that in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir; in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Whom did you live with when you went to school in Freeport?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_601">601</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. With my grandmother who has since deceased.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did you live in Dallas, Tex., after November of 1958?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. When I moved in November of 1958 there, I stayed until I just
moved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When was it that you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. We left in January of 1964 to go to Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say “we,” whom do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. The company; the show I am in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which show is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Bottoms Up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long were you in Houston then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. We were in Houston for 12 weeks and then from Houston we came
out to Las Vegas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When, to the best of your recollection, did you first meet Mr.
Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I would say about 3½ years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were the circumstances of your becoming acquainted with
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. We were having financial trouble at a club we owned called the
Playbill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say “we,” whom do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Joe Peterson, my partner. We needed a place to go to do a show.
Jack Ruby offered a very lucrative offer to play his new club. It was then
called the Sovereign Club which later became the Carousel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, what was the nature of the lucrative offer which Mr. Ruby
made to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Well, I think he was going to pay us, I think, I’m not sure, $125
a week plus we were on a small percentage of the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did you play for Mr. Ruby at the Sovereign Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I would say about 8 weeks. Maybe less.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What happened, if anything, to terminate that arrangement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. We got into an argument over a contract that I had signed stating
that I would perform the show for one night for around $2,200.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What show were you supposed to perform for one night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Bottoms Up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. For whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I don’t recall the name of the organization. It was a nurses’
organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was that show supposed to be performed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. In the ballroom of the Hotel Adolphus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the nature of your disagreement with Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. He was in a financial bind because the show wasn’t working out
like he thought and we were in a financial bind and needed the money and he
would let us do it only if we would give him half. We couldn’t because we
couldn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What do you mean “we”? You still mean Joe Peterson and you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes. And we called in the union man of our performing arts called
AGVA.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is that an abbreviation of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. American Guild of Variety Artists. And the AGVA man sided with
Jack and we got into an argument wherein Jack punched Joe in the mouth
and broke off a tooth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Joe Peterson, that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir. And we left that night. I might also add in the record
that the man, the name of the man representing our union, was named James
Dolen who was arrested later, some months later, by the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On what charge, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir; as far as I know he was running some sort of bingo
game or something illegal in Louisiana.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you perform that show Bottoms Up?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_602">602</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir. Jack Ruby and Jim Dolen took the show over and made
our kids perform the show.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was the same troupe then performing the show except for
you and Mr. Peterson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. The only one we have now with us that did the show with us
over at the Adolphus that particular night is Bill Fanning who is in our show.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. After that 8-week connection with Mr. Ruby what later association,
if any, did you have with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Well, I didn’t speak to Jack for about, I would say, around 6
months but he and Mr. Peterson became good friends again because they have
the type personalities that flare up and forget; and I don’t—I have a mind like
an elephant—and they started speaking so, therefore, I started speaking and
going back to the club which he changed into a stripper club called the Carousel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever work for Mr. Ruby again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then from that time on you knew him as a friend and acquaintance
in the Dallas area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was your occupation from the time you left Mr. Ruby’s
until you left Dallas in January of 1964?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. We reopened the Playbill Club for about 4 months and then we
went back to the—I’m sorry—then we went to the Maple Theater, did a show
for about 6 weeks called Mr. Wonderful, then back to the Adolphus Hotel where
we stayed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do at the Adolphus Hotel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Bottoms Up. Performed it in the Century Room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How frequently did you see Mr. Ruby during the years of 1961,
1962, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Well, after we lost the Playbill again for a second time and we
closed the show at the Maple Theater, then we were right across the street
from where Jack had his club and Jack got a haircut at the barbershop in the
hotel, ate in the hotel restaurant, consequently I think that is when he started—he
and Joe started being friends and I started seeing him a lot and became
good friends; then when we started at the Adolphus in 1962, maybe the latter
part of 1961, we started speaking and being good friends. We would go over
there sometimes three or four times a week just to see the show and the girls
over there which we were good friends with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To your knowledge, did Jack Ruby ever associate with any of
the criminal element?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. He always reminded me of a gangster but I have never seen him
with anyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why did he always remind you of a gangster?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Just the way he talks, you know, he just reminds me of a real
hood. Still I have never seen him with anyone that you would call a criminal
in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Aside from his appearance and the way he talks do you have
any factual reason for saying that he appears to be a hood or gangster?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To your knowledge was Jack Ruby ever a member of any subversive
organization or any group which advocates the forceful overthrow of
the United States Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were any members of his family or friends ever members of any
subversive organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I only met one relative of his which was his sister, Eva, or Ava,
however you would say it. I just met her casually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is her last name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I really don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Grant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Grant. That is right. She ran his club on—what street is it?
I have to think of the club for a minute. It is right next door to the B&amp;B.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The Vegas Club?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_603">603</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir. Thank you. That was the only time. I have only been
out to the Vegas Club maybe twice in the whole time I have been in Dallas
but I would see her at the B&amp;B restaurant eating after she had closed her club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever know Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever see Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Only after he had shot the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know whether Jack Ruby ever knew Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever see Jack Ruby and Lee Harvey Oswald together at
any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir; not at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know whether Jack Ruby knew Officer J. D. Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir; I don’t. He knew most of the policemen on the police force.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever see Jack Ruby with Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I don’t know what he looks like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know who Officer Tippit is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. He was the officer who was shot and killed the day of the
assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall Friday, November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were your activities on that day to the best of your ability
to recollect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. That was very easy to remember. We went down to the Adolphus
marquee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. “We” meaning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Joe Peterson and also with us was Nancy Austin, who is in our
show, and Kenny Jerome, who is in our show. We watched President Kennedy
drive by and I was listening to it on the radio as he was driving and when he
passed us he was going 30 miles an hour whereas he had been going 10 miles
an hour so we missed him. With all the excitement and everything we didn’t
get a good look at him so we went upstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Your view of the motorcade from the Adolphus was from the
marquee of the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do after the Presidential limousine passed the
Adolphus Hotel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. We wanted to get a better look at the President so Joe Peterson
and myself decided to go out to the airport because when he was out there, when
he first arrived in Dallas, he stayed out there I think 30 minutes longer than
he was supposed to, shaking hands with the people. We thought he might do
it again. We ran upstairs to change clothes. It was a very cold day. We
needed to put on some warm clothes. We went upstairs to change clothes and
go out to the airport. We always left our television on because we have a dog
and it sort of keeps him calm. When we opened the door into the bedroom they
announced over the television that the President had been assassinated. Joe
went down to the—as far as I know he went down to the Book Depository to see
what it looked like and I stayed in the bedroom and watched the television to
find out what was, you know, going on. We stayed there all that night and we
departed for Galveston to get away from Dallas the next day, which was
Saturday, at around 3 or 4 in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do the balance of Friday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. We stayed and watched television. I didn’t move from the
television set.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you have dinner that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. In the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you go to bed on the evening of November 22, if
you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. As far as I know I didn’t go to bed until 5 in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do all that night?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_604">604</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Watched television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were the television stations running around the clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you awaken on Saturday, November 23, if
you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I would say around 8 o’clock, 9 o’clock. I woke up and watched
television again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you eat breakfast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I went down to breakfast on Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Down to where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. The coffee shop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Of the Adolphus Hotel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir. Then I came right back up and watched television again
until that afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you leave the hotel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. About 3 or 4 that afternoon we left for Galveston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say “we,” whom do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Joe Peterson and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. By what means did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. In our car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you make any telephone calls on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir. I called the McKennas to tell them we were coming
down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you make any telephone calls on Friday, the day before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I’m sure I made telephone calls to each cast member telling them
we would not perform until Monday or Tuesday, that Mr. Anderson didn’t know
yet—he is the manager of the hotel—I’m sure I made quite a few calls that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had you had a conversation with Mr. Anderson concerning the
closing of the show?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir. He called us saying there wouldn’t be a show
until Monday or Tuesday depending on when the funeral was. He didn’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is his full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. All I know is Andy Anderson. He has initials. I don’t know, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What members of the cast did you call following your conversation
with Mr. Anderson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Everyone in the cast, and I may forget a few names. I can list
them if you’d like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Please do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Carl Tressler in Fort Worth. There would also be Eddie Parker,
Bill Fanning, Suzanne Malone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where does she live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. In Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where does Carl Tressler live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Fort Worth. All the cast members in our show live in Dallas with
the exception of Carl Tressler and Eddie Parker who live in Fort Worth. All
of my calls would have been in Fort Worth except for the long distance calls in
Galveston. We have had so many castings I really can’t remember the rest
of the people we had in our show. Possibly I made a call to Hazel Rippe, if
she was still in the show.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That would have been in Dallas also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir. All these telephone numbers would be in Dallas. Hazel
wasn’t in our show. There is another phone number in Fort Worth, it was a
girl dancer in our show by the name of Ryna Hradecky, who was a friend of
Carl Tressler’s, so, therefore, I might have given a message to Carl to call Ryna
because I couldn’t get her at home at that particular time but if I had any calls
to Fort Worth it would be to Ryna also. There would be one or two other calls
to Dallas which would be cast members but I really can’t think who was in the
show.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At about what time did you call Tom McKenna?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. It would probably be, I would say, around 2 in the afternoon
because we decided very quickly we were going. We just got tired of laying
around the room watching television. I was beginning to get “buggy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_605">605</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you have called him as late as 5:30 that afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir; it could have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do then the balance of that afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Watched television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you watch television all the time up until the point when
you left to go to Galveston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you arrive in Galveston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. It would be 11 o’clock; somewhere around 11 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How far is it from Dallas to Galveston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I didn’t make the call from Dallas to Galveston at 2—it must have
been 5:30—because it only takes 4½ hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is the distance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Around 200 miles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you make any stops en route?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Only for gas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you have dinner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. We didn’t have dinner. We don’t ever eat when we drive to
Galveston, just go straight on down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you eat when you arrived at Galveston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir; we ate at the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At Mr. McKenna’s house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do after arriving in Galveston that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Well, just as nearly, as quickly as we arrived is when we got a
telephone call from Jack Ruby. After I talked to him we sat and visited and
then went to bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did the telephone call from Mr. Ruby last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I would say it couldn’t have been more than only 5 minutes. Maybe
3½ minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. State, as precisely as you can recollect, exactly what Jack Ruby
said to you and what you said to him during that telephone call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Well, he was having trouble with the union, or AGVA, and I had
been elected the president of the council, newly elected president, and we had
not even had a meeting yet but—I can’t remember—he was having some sort
of problems with his girls and the union was going to make him do something,
which I didn’t think was right. I told him I would help him out and make
sure his case was presented correctly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the union trying to make him do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I don’t recall. I really don’t know but—I wasn’t going to be on
his side, but I was going to be sure it was presented correctly, that we would get
his angle as much as the union’s, the girl that was reporting him or whatever
the circumstances were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you friends with Mr. Ruby at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir. He was very upset the President was assassinated and
he called Abe Weinstein or Bernie Weinstein, he called them some names for
staying open Friday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What club did they run?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. They—I don’t know which one owns which. One owns the Theater
Lounge and the other owns the Colony Club, and he was very upset that he had
closed and they stayed open. He thought it wasn’t right and he wanted to
know when I would return to Dallas and I told him probably Monday or Tuesday
and he said, well, when I got in to town would I call him, which I said I would.
He asked how everything was. I told him fine and that was it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you recollect anything else he said during that telephone
conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you recollect anything else that you said to him during that
call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Only if I told him why I left Dallas. He asked what I was doing
in Galveston. I told him I just wanted to get away for a couple of days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he mention Lee Harvey Oswald in that telephone call?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_606">606</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir; not at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he mention anything about any assassin or the assassin
whoever he might be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir. The only thing that he said which would be important
to the Commission was that he was very upset that the other clubs had decided
to stay open and that they did not have the decency to close on such a day and
that he thought out of respect they should close. That is the only thing I recall
that he said that would be of any importance. The other things were about his
business with the union, how we were and why we went down to Galveston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he say anything about any intention he might have to do anything
to Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir; not at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Prior to that telephone call on the night of November 23, when
was the last time you had talked to Ruby before that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. It could have been 2 or 3 days before. I don’t know, as I said.
I saw him that often, you know. I do recall the last time I was in his club was
the week before he shot Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When were you in his club during that week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. We had signed a contract to go into the Continental Hotel in
Houston and we had <span class="locked">the——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. By “we” you mean you and Joe Peterson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Right. Whenever I use “we” that is always Joe Peterson. And
we had—the man who signed us felt pretty good about it and wanted to stay
up beyond 12 o’clock, which is our curfew in Texas, and the only place that was
open is the three exotic clubs and we decided to take Larry Grayson, booker
of the Continental, to Jack Ruby’s club and let him see a stripper called Jada.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Weren’t the exotic clubs governed by the curfew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir; I’m sorry. The Theater Lounge and the Colony Club did
close—I’m sorry. They didn’t close. No; they didn’t. You could serve a beer
called near beer which did not contain any alcohol, or they would serve coffee.
They did not have to close at the same time the others closed; so we took Larry
and went over there and stayed up until around 2 or 3. I recall the incident, by
the way, that Jack was having trouble with the union about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What incident was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. It was something about the comic had to perform in between each
stripper to lengthen the time of the show and where he had lined up three
strippers at one time and then a comic and then three strippers again.
He was having trouble with time. He wanted to make the show continuous and this
was the problem he was having, so the night that I went to the Carousel Club
with Larry Grayson and Joe Peterson he, himself, got on stage and entertained
for 30 minutes with a raffle and I recall that Larry turned to me and said—every
time that Jack would do something he would try and be very funny—every
time he would do something he would turn to me and say. “Is that all
right, Breck?” and Larry turned to me and said, “He thinks a great deal of you.
Every time he does anything he turns to you,” and I said, “Yes.” I definitely
remember that. That was the problem of trying to <span class="locked">make——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What night was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. It was at least a week before, maybe not—maybe not quite a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you recall the specific night that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir; I can’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Prior to that time when had you last seen Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I really don’t know, sir. I don’t think probably I saw him at all
until after the President had been shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, I’m going back, before the time you said you had this
conversation with him on that Saturday night when you were in Galveston.
You saw Jack Ruby at the Carousel Club some time about a week before the
assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When, prior to the time you were in the Carousel Club a week
before the assassination, had you last seen Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Possibly on the street or something. I had gone up to the club a
week or two before that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_607">607</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had you discussed this problem concerning the American Guild
of Variety Artists with Jack Ruby prior to that telephone conversation on
November 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir; I had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When had you discussed it with him before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. He had called <span class="locked">me——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Possibly 2 weeks before the assassination—telling me his problem
and wanting to know when it would be brought up at the meeting, and I told
him that we usually met the 15th of each month and that at the next meeting
I would—I’m sorry. I made an error. We meet every Thursday. Every Thursday
there was a union meeting and the 15th is when we meet privately, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have an official capacity with the union, that is, were
you an officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Well, I was an officer as being elected the president of the inter-union.
In other words, all the performers, if there was a complaint that some
performer had done something wrong and the management said that he was right
and the performer said that they were right, then the performers themselves
elected a committee of about six that would determine who was right, and this
was the committee and I really don’t even know the correct name of the committee.
They would judge who was right and wrong and what would be done
about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any official standing on the committee which was to
take up Jack Ruby’s problem?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I don’t understand what you mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you responsible in any official way for the committee which
was to consider the problem Jack Ruby had with the guild?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. My capacity was to make sure that everything was presented correctly
and this was the only thing that Jack was after me to do is to make sure
his side of the story was heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was it up to you to make the decision on who was right and who
was wrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. It was up to the committee, six members.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You were one of the members of the committee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, when did Jack Ruby first discuss his problem with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I would say around 2 weeks before the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did he next discuss the problem with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. He called me a couple of times to see if we had had a meeting or
not. He would call and I would tell him; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that by telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir; he would call me at the hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how many times did he call you after he first discussed it
with you approximately 2 weeks before the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I would say about two times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did he make those telephone calls to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. In the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately how long before the assassination were those
calls made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Well, the last one was the Saturday night, midnight the last call
came, that was the main reason he was calling me was to find out if we had had
a meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he call you once or twice between the first time he talked to
you about the guild problem and the time he called you in Galveston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. About twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did those two telephone calls occur, to the best of your
recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. In the afternoon. That was the only time to get me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What dates?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I can’t recall any dates.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you discuss any thing else in any of those two telephone
calls other than the specific problem with the guild?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_608">608</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had Mr. Ruby called you at Galveston prior to the time he completed
the call shortly after your arrival at Galveston on that Saturday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I’m sorry. Had he——?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he just call you the first time and make that connection with
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir; as far as I know. Otherwise my mother would have said
that she received a long distance call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say your <span class="locked">mother——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Nonnie. Mrs. McKenna.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mrs. McKenna did not refer to any prior call to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know how Mr. Ruby got your telephone number in
Galveston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir. I left my telephone number where I would be in Galveston
with the operator in Dallas, which I do every time I go out of town so
they will know how to contact me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your purpose in leaving your telephone number in that
manner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Well, I get quite a few calls and the main reason I left it was
because Mr. Anderson, who was the manger of the hotel, hadn’t decided what
day to come back to work, Monday or Tuesday, therefore, I needed to know so,
therefore, I left the telephone number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. After you completed your telephone conversation with Jack Ruby
on that Saturday night, November 23, what did you do next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. As far as I can remember I had a sandwich and visited with the
folks for about 45 minutes, then went to bed because I was kind of tired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At what time did you awaken on Sunday morning, November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I don’t know the precise time. I do know it was about—it couldn’t
have been more than 10 minutes before Jack shot Oswald because I had just
gotten up and walked in the bedroom and was watching it in the folks’ bedroom,
so whatever time Jack shot Oswald I was only up 10 minutes beforehand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What, if anything, did you observe on the television screen at
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Nothing at all to relate it was Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you know it was Jack at the time you saw the shooting of
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What part of the man did you see on the television screen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. It all happened so quick I didn’t see anything except I understood
Jack had been shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Understood who had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I’m sorry, that Oswald had been shot and that—I watched the interview
with the policeman saying he knew who it was but could not say
publicly who it was. We waited around and, I would say, within a matter
of 15 minutes they announced who it was. It seems to me that quick.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who did they announce that it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Jack Ruby, owner of a stripper club called the Carousel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was your reaction, if any, to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Well, it was a shock. That is all I can say. It was a real shock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do for the balance of that Sunday afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Well, I would say within 30 minutes to an hour we received a call
from the Washington Post representative who, I believe, was in Dallas at the
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did that representative of the Washington Post happen to
call you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I have no idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know what his name was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you say to him, if anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Well, I was still in shock. I told him that I had talked to Jack
over the telephone and he asked what we had said and I told him and he said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_609">609</span>
“Well, can you tell me a little about him?” And I was at that time having an
argument with Mr. Peterson on what to do, you know, keep your mouth shut,
or, you know, say what you had to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was Mr. Peterson’s view?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. He said to keep my mouth shut, he did not want to get involved
in any way, and that the right people would come to us and for us not to say
anything <span class="locked">so——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was your view about that subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Well, I didn’t know. I don’t know. I can’t remember. I would
say mine was the same way. I was kind of scared, to be honest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why were you scared?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Just when people start calling you long distance you get seared.
You don’t want to get involved in anything, particularly if you didn’t have anything
to do with it. Then the next telephone call we got was from Dick Hitt, who
is a man on the—a columnist for the Dallas Times Herald who knew I was a
very close friend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had you known Mr. Hitt before that telephone call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Oh, yes; ever since I have been in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did Mr. Hitt say to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. He wanted to know about—he wanted me to talk to his editor
or someone about Jack, to find out what kind of a person he was and everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you talk to his editor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. We did but very coldly. Joe talked to the editor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you talk to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I talked to Dick Hitt but whenever they called back the man called
back and said: “Dick Hitt said for me to call you.” Joe got on the phone and
said: “No, I don’t know anything.” I have a correction to make. The first
call that we received was from the Dallas Morning News. The second call we
got was from the Washington Post and the last call we got was from Dick Hitt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who called you from the Dallas Morning News?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I would say right now as far as I can remember it was Hugh
Ainsworth because he also knew I was a very good friend of Jack’s.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the content of the conversation between you and Mr.
Ainsworth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. The conversation was that Jack had called me and—Hugh and I
were good speaking friends. Not close friends, but we had talked a great deal—of
course, this being the first person I had talked to that had also known Jack,
we were just in a conversation. I told him: “Yes, I had received a call,” you
know, I was sort of outspoken in discussing it with Hugh. Joe got kind of
angry and said we should not meddle in any way at all and so the Washington
Post called after that and we were sort of cool and when Dick Hitt called we
said we knew nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you receive any other telephone calls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you make any telephone calls on that Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Whom did you call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I called Nancy Austin, who is a performer in our show, to find out
how to get hold of Phil Burleson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was Phil Burleson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. He was my attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long had he been your attorney?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Since I arrived in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was the purpose of your wanting to get Mr. Burleson’s
telephone number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Well, Phil also knew Jack and I wanted to see if he was going to
represent Jack or if he could or wanted to or to see if he could get in to see Jack
to see what was going on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Well, as I say, I was in shock. I was upset because I liked Jack
very much. He has been a very good friend of ours even with our ups and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_610">610</span>
downs. Just to make sure everything was all right. To find out what was
going on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had anybody requested you to contact an attorney on behalf of
Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That thought came to you on your own initiative?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you discuss it with Mr. Peterson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes; I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did Mr. Peterson say about that telephone call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. It was fine with him. The main thing that Joe objected to, he did
not want to be in print about saying anything or doing anything that would
jeopardize our position at the Adolphus Hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you know that Jack Ruby had other attorneys who represented
him regularly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he have any other attorney, to your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I have never known him to have any attorney at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That is prior to the time of the shooting of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you make any other telephone calls on that Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Well, any other phone calls I would have made would have been to
cast members.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. For what purpose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. To tell them that we still didn’t know we were going to do the
show or anything about it, just be prepared to come in Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, whenever they were notified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall any other specific calls you made on that Sunday,
November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do the balance of the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Watched television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you go to sleep that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Late. It was very late.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you have supper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. In the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you leave the house at all that Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir; I didn’t go out at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you arise on the following Monday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I would say Monday night. I really don’t, to be honest with you,
I don’t know what time I arrived back. I don’t know if we performed Monday
or Tuesday. From all recollection it was Tuesday we performed. I don’t
know. It could have been Tuesday afternoon that we got back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you go back to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I don’t remember, sir, now what day it was we left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you seen Jack Ruby after the shooting of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. It was the first Saturday or the second Saturday after the assassination
I was in the hotel room watching the football game and it was in the
afternoon and Sheriff Bill Decker called me and said that Jack was very depressed
and needed some cheering up and wanted to know if I would come
down, so I went down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long after Sheriff Decker’s call did you arrive at the jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I would say between half an hour and 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did you stay at the jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I would say about 20 minutes, maybe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. State as specifically as you can recollect the nature of your
conversation with Jack Ruby indicating what he said to you and what you
said to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Well, I wasn’t the only person there. There were two other people
there, one man I don’t know—I have seen him around before. The other man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_611">611</span>
was, I’m sure you have it in your records, he was the partner of Jack in the
club who tried to run it after Jack had shot Oswald. I can’t think of the man’s
name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall the first name of either of those men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir; I don’t. I know them by face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there anyone else present besides the four of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir; except for the two policemen that were inside the tank
where Jack was. He was inside the tank.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What conversation ensued while you were present with Mr.
Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Well, the main thing Jack brought out was he thought himself
correct in shooting Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. For what reason?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. A far as I can remember he didn’t give a reason. He just said,
you know. “I was right in doing it.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did any one disagree with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Well, they just didn’t say anything against him. I can’t remember
the incident too well. I do know that Jack was very upset and the two men,
on the outside, didn’t argue with him at all in anything that he said, and they
said they wouldn’t. I remember them making the comment to each other they
weren’t going to upset him, and whatever he said they would just nod yes to
and would agree with; they weren’t going to get him upset.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you say to Jack, if anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I talked to him about Phil.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Phil who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Burleson. “I was wondering if Phil came up to see you,” and,
“I asked him to come up,” and “If you can get him to represent you as one
of the attorneys,” and everything. “I think it would be very good for you since
he was at one time the assistant district attorney.” I said, “I think he would
do a good job for you. He is very honest, very aboveboard,” and Jack said,
“Yes, he came to see me and I think he would do well and I would like to use
him if I can.” Then I asked him how they were treating him in jail and
he said how nice they were to him and he asked me what I was doing.
I told him I was watching the football game and Sheriff Decker said I could come
down and see him. Then he asked me specifically did I want to get involved
in the case in any way, or something like that, and I told him under the circumstances
please don’t ever use our name or anything. It’s not that I didn’t
like him. It was just that it might ruin our careers that we worked very
hard for. He gave me his word he would never use us, say anything about us
in any publication or anything. This was very true. While we were in
Houston he needed money and wrote an article for a series of newspapers and
he stated in the article, toward the end he made a call to Joe Feder and Beck
Wald, which I thought was very nice of him and all the other circumstances in
the article that I could see he used the names of the people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Joe Feder was really Joe Peterson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And Beck Wald was really you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Me; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you recollect anything more about the conversation that
you had at the jail on the Saturday you refer to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir. It was the first time I had seen him since the assassination
and it was just, you know, kind of strange meeting. There wasn’t any fun
in it at all, you know, like laughs. Sheriff Decker told me he wanted to be
cheered up. It was not like that at all. It was a very sad thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever seen Jack Ruby since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir; I have gotten a few letters from Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I would say about three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did he write to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. From the jail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_612">612</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where were you when you received those letters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. In—I think I received two in Dallas and I would say one in
Houston, and they were very simple letters, just how he was feeling and, you
know, what he was doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you respond?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes; I wrote him back and told him what we were doing and
how we were doing and I hoped he was well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many times did you write to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Maybe three or four times. I don’t know. I do remember another
thing we discussed while he was in the jail. He said he was writing—I remember
two things—he was writing down his memoirs and wanted to do it
into a story form and would I be interested in doing it for him. I told him
I would see. And the other thing he mentioned to me is he had received a lot
of telegrams and letters from all over the country saying he was correct in
doing what he did, or he was wrong in doing what he did, or whatever it was.
He was getting so many in he had no way of writing them back. He wanted to
thank each and every one for writing to him and wanted to know if I would
correspond with them on behalf of him and that is when I said, “I would
rather not get involved in any way and you can understand why.” And he said,
“Yes, I do.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you had any other contacts at all with Jack Ruby after
November 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Only through corresponding letters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You have now mentioned all of the contacts you have had with
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Going back to November 21——</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I have one. I’m sorry. I do have one. As I said, Phil Burleson
is Joe’s and my attorney and, therefore, I would go see Phil every once in
awhile just to give Jack a message of hello, that we are thinking of him, and
to see how he was. We were all right and everything. I did ask Phil to do
this for me. Every once in awhile I would do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now related all of the contacts you have had with
Ruby since November 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Going back to November 21, the day before the assassination in
1963, did you have occasion to talk by telephone to Tom McKenna on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. The day before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir; not at all unless it was about football. I am a football
fanatic. It was the day before. This would be Thursday, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would it refresh your recollection if I said you had a telephone
call with him at about 6:50 on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir; it wouldn’t because I call him quite frequently. I just
made a telephone call to him day before yesterday. Unless it was just to say
hello and everything. We did not decide to go down to Galveston until that
afternoon, the day after the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long have you known Edward Parker of Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Eddie Parker is—came to work for us for Bottoms Up at the
Adolphus and he would help in costume changes and setting up the props. We
had a portable stage which he would set up and get everything ready before
the show would start. That would be about a year and a half, but we performed
at the Playbill Club, we performed a show which he also helped us in, called
Razzmataz was the name of the show.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall telephoning him on October 1st, 3d, and 4th, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir; I would call him in any respect to the show. The only
reason I would have anything to do with him would be to tell him whether we
would do a television show, needed him there and needed Carl Tressler, who
was in our show. They are roommates. Anytime I would call them would be
in reference to the show.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You already mentioned you called him on November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. To tell him probably that the show had been canceled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_613">613</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At about what time was that call made, if you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Well, it would probably be around, I would say, 1 or 2 o’clock. As
soon as Mr. Anderson told us we would not perform that night or Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could it have been as late as 6 that evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir; it could have been as I was going out of town to tell
him I was leaving and would be in Galveston; if they needed to get hold of me
to call the operator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But you didn’t go to Galveston on Friday, November 22, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir; that was just to tell him we were not going to do a show
that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know a Patricia Farmer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know a Clarence Vought?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What relatives, if any, does Tom McKenna have in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. The only one that would be there would be his son who is 18 years
old, George McKenna, who was working on a construction job at the Republic
National Bank.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know R. D. Matthews?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know whether Jack Ruby knew anybody by the name
of R. D. Matthews?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Only if that was the man I couldn’t think of in the previous statement.
I said I knew their faces but not their names, but the name doesn’t ring
a bell at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know anything about Jack Ruby’s trip to Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I have never heard of anything like that at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know anybody by the name of Henry Atcheson, A-t-c-h-e-s-o-n,
or Henry Acteson, A-c-t-e-s-o-n?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you make any telephone call from the Adolphus Hotel to
anyone in Canada during March of 1964?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I can’t remember ever calling Canada. As I stated before to you
the only one that I ever knew in Canada was Kay Sutton, who was a performer
in our show who was somewhere in Canada.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know James F. Mahon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir; he is my attorney, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you make a call to him on November 23, that is Saturday
after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir; possibly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the purpose of that call, if I may ask?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Well, to find out, possibly, if he knew anything about Jack; to
see if he was going to represent Jack or anything. He also knew Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. This was the day before the shooting of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Well, it could be any business thing. Phil handled most of our
things but as things stand right now Jim Mahon handles everything for us, our
bookkeeping and everything, so it could have been anything at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you make any other calls on November 23, 1963, if you can
remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. The 23d <span class="locked">was——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That is Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir; I could have called any number of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you make a call to RI 8-1434?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. That number—that could have been Jim Mahon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was Jim Mahon’s number Riverside 8-4361 or do you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No; that is his number. I do know—Riverside, 1434, I don’t know,
sir. I’m sure I placed quite a few calls that day. I talked to a lot of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever have a financial interest with Jack Ruby in the
Sovereign Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir; not as far as putting in our own money at all; only that
we would retain a percentage of the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What do you mean by “retain a percentage of the club”?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_614">614</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. For doing our shows there because we only received a small salary,
as I said, $125 a week. He said he would give us a portion of the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you mean a percentage of the gross receipts or a percentage
of the net receipts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I mean a percent of the club, period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Half ownership in the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that ever formalized into a written contract?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. As far as I know it was, sir, but I don’t remember where the papers
are. I think they were destroyed in the fire at the Playbill Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever get such an interest in the Sovereign Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever been interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
or any other other Federal agency regarding your connection with
Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I have never been called into an office and interviewed at all.
Possibly there were some men who came by and asked me a few questions but
I can’t remember it. It was that vague. I do know Joe Peterson was interviewed
by some representatives of the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you think you may have been interviewed by the FBI, but
you are not sure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever tell the FBI anything about Ruby’s telephone call
on the night of November 23 to you in Galveston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir; if they interviewed me I definitely told them about it
because it was very important.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But you are just not sure whether or not they interviewed you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I will tell you, things happened so fast. I definitely remember
Joe came back and said, “Two representatives want to talk to you,” but I don’t
remember ever talking to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You don’t have any specific recollection of ever talking to them
or telling them about that telephone call from Jack Ruby on Saturday, November
23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Wall, did you and I have a brief interview before this
deposition started today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And during the course of that interview did I ask you the outline
of the questions which we have covered here on the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And were your answers the same as you told me here this afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add which you think would be helpful
in any way to the President’s Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Well, the only thing that I stated to you before is that previously
I said that Jack and Joe got into a fight when he blew his stack but then on
the other hand there was a time when we needed $300 very desperately and
Jack in a matter of 10 minutes went over and got a loan on his own car for us
so that the man does have feelings and he can flare up in 5 minutes and then
forget about it, you know. I can’t, but he is one type of person who can. You
never know what he is going to do next.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know Ralph Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. That was the name of the gentleman who was visiting Jack at
the same time I was that I could not remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Aside from that time in the jail have you ever talked to Ralph
Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Very, very little. Jack at one time has taken Joe and I to a
bowling alley—I remember Ralph Paul was along—and took us for breakfast.
We bowled a game but I still didn’t say seven or eight words to the man. I was
very friendly but I still didn’t say anything to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_615">615</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you make any effort to telephone Ralph Paul anytime on
November 22 or 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Or November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. No, sir. I wouldn’t even know how to get ahold of the man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Wall, if you wish, we can make available the typed-up copy
of this deposition for you to read and sign, or if you are willing, you can waive
that signature which means that you will not read and sign the transcript. Do
you have any preference on the subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. I will do whatever is the easiest, for you all and the best way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you willing then to waive your reading and signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wall</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

</div>

<p>The testimony of Joseph Alexander Peterson was taken at 3:45 p.m., on
August 5, 1964, at the U.S. Post Office Building, 301 Stewart Street, Las Vegas,
Nev., by Mr. Arlen Specter, assistant counsel of the President’s Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show present at this time is Mr. Joseph Peterson.
Mr. Peterson, the President’s Commission on the Assassination of President
Kennedy has asked you to appear so that we may take your deposition
concerning any knowledge you have of Mr. Jack Ruby, his activities during the
period around the assassination of President Kennedy, and any of his associates.
With that preliminary statement of purpose, would you stand up and raise
your right hand, please?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you shall give in this proceeding
before the President’s Commission shall be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you state your full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Joseph Alexander Peterson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever been known by any other name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Joseph Jablonka.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that the name under which you were born, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You say that has been legally changed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Legally changed. My stepfather’s name is Walter Peterson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When was your name changed from Jablonka to Peterson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. November 1965. I remember that well because that was when
I was married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. November of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. 19—excuse me, 1946.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your birthday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. February 14, 1924.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Brooklyn, NY.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where have you lived since the time you were born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Let’s see, now. I have lived in Flatbush, Rogers Avenue, 649
Rogers Avenue, <span class="locked">and——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Until when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Wait a minute. Before that, 280 19th Street, Brooklyn, N.Y.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did you live in Brooklyn altogether?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. The family; all our lives. Me, I went in the service, came out,
went to Jacksonville, Fla.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_616">616</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you live in Brooklyn until you went into the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you go into the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. 1941.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long were you in the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. 1945.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you live after leaving the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. 1946 I went to—back home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Brooklyn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did you live in Brooklyn after 1946?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Let’s see. I guess a period about up until 1950.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you live after 1950?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did you live in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Three years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you live after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Jacksonville, Fla. No; wait a minute. I didn’t go to Jacksonville,
Fla. I visited Jacksonville, went to New Orleans, then from New
Orleans, Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. 1950, 1951, 1952.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let’s go back to 1950. You were living in Brooklyn at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Just before that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you go then in 1950?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. To New Orleans. Now, approximately—probably it was the
end of 1950 because 1951 was so close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did you live in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Two and a half to three years, and then I went to Dallas,
Tex. I lived there ever since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In what year did you move to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. About the end of 1953 or 1954.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did you live thereafter in Dallas, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Up to now. I went to—let’s see, now. I went to Houston
with the show last February. Up until last February I was in Dallas, Tex.
I was in the show in Houston, February, March, April, May, June-January,
February, March, then came here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your occupation at the present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Producer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Coproducer of musical shows with Breck Wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where are you employed right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Castaways Casino.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Here in Las Vegas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Right. In Las Vegas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long have you been in show business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Since about 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long have you known Mr. Breck Wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Since 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long, if at all, did you know Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I knew Jack Ruby—let me think, now. Probably it was the
last part of 1961 and we did one show there at his club. I believe it was 1961.
I’m trying to figure. We went back to the Adolphus in 1962. It was probably
in 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say “one show,” what do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Did a musical revue called Sticks and Stones there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did that last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Lasted about 2 or 3 months, I guess. We had problems.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What problems did you have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Well, a lot of disagreements. At the time Jack was changing
the club from a—he was reopening it. It was called the Sovereign. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_617">617</span>
making it into a private club. He wanted to do something different. We were
successful across the street with our revue. He talked to us about putting the
show up there, going 50-50 on a business basis with the club which we never
received anything about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever enter into an agreement with Jack Ruby wherein
you were to have a 50-50 interest in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Yes; this was written up with Vic Victorson, his attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Victorson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Yes; Victor Victorson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How do you spell that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Victorson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. V-i-c-t-o-r-s-o-n?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Yes; the agreement was with him. It never held up though.
We got nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You never received any interest in the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Not a thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever endeavor to enforce that agreement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Yes; the only thing we ever got out of it was through a loan.
I think Breck borrowed $300 to go to New York on a business trip. That is
all the money we received out of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever try to make Jack Ruby live up to the agreement
in any other way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. There was no use. Jack Ruby, in spite of our disagreements,
he was kind of good natured in a way. The best thing to do was to bow out
quietly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you first meet Jack Ruby in approximately September 1961,
when you played “Sticks and Stones”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. About that time; a little before that he came up to visit us at
the club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. September of 1960. Sometime around in there. He came up
like a lot of club owners do. I think when we reopened the club he came up
and visited us. We were introduced to him as Jack Ruby. That was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. After you terminated your business relationship with him when
the show “Sticks and Stones” ended, how frequently, if at all, did you see him
thereafter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. He came and visited us quite a lot at the Century Room. He
would come in when he had guests, big-shot type of thing, wanted to be recognized.
He was very nice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have a cordial relationship notwithstanding your prior
difficulties?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Right; right. Like I say, it was best to keep everything on a
hello-goodbye basis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How frequently did you see him after 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Well, normally, like bump into him. It was only across the
street. We were living at the Adolphus. Back and forth. It’s hard to tell how
many times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever have any more business dealings with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No; once we went into bankruptcy, Breck and I, and like when
all friendship failed we went to Jack Ruby and he came through. He was real
fine. Loaned us money. We paid him back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How much money did he loan you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. It wasn’t exactly a loan. It was a thing, holding on costumes
we had for the show. It was $400.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To your knowledge did Jack Ruby have any association with
any of the criminal elements?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Well, if you want to go by hearsay, yes; but actually I don’t
know of any. In fact he was in thicker with the police in Dallas than anybody
else I knew of because they were always in his place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What hearsay are you referring to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I am talking about any hearsay. Because of his character
automatically people would take him as a thug.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_618">618</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What aspect of his character would cause people to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Outward appearance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Anything besides outward appearance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No; Jack, in spite of our differences, he was a nice, a good
man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever see him associate with any of the criminal element
personally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To your knowledge was Jack Ruby a member of any organization
which advocated the forceful overthrow of the U.S. Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To your knowledge was any member of his family a member
of any such organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I know nothing about his family except I had met his sister.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To your knowledge were any of his friends or associates members
of any subversive organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No; not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you see Jack Ruby most recently prior to November 22,
1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I guess it was before we went to Galveston. Sometime before
then. I couldn’t peg it down. I’m sure we saw him. Like I say, we saw him
on the street there. Next thing was the call and that was it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You don’t recall seeing him specifically on any special date prior
to the day of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But you do think, in a general way, you must have seen him
because he was in the area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall the day of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Tell me as specifically as you can recollect what you did on
that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Well, there was going to be the parade. We went down and
stood on the marquee of the Adolphus Hotel. We were there with some newspaper
people we knew and everybody at the hotel. The President passed by.
We came back in the lobby. Next thing we knew we heard on the television
he had been shot. That was it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do next; if anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. As well as I can remember either we called or went upstairs,
told the rest of the kids in the cast, those that weren’t out. Just astonishment.
Everybody was in the lobby just moving around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you leave the hotel on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you go to sleep that night, if you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Well, that night we didn’t have a show. I don’t believe we
had a show. No; we didn’t have a show that night. They canceled it for three
nights. That is when we went to Galveston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you go to Galveston specifically?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Let me think. When was the 22d? What day was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The 22d was a Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. It was that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you go to Galveston Friday or Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I’m not sure whether it was Friday or Saturday because they
canceled the show. I think it might have been the next day. I don’t know. I
could not be sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recollect what you did next day before you went to
Galveston; if in fact it was that day you went to Galveston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. The next day before we went to Galveston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; you have told me—let’s go back to Friday. You told me
you stayed around the hotel the balance of that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_619">619</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then you say you went to Galveston either Friday or Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Tell me, to the best of your recollection, everything that you did
before you went to Galveston from the time of the assassination on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Well, we stayed at the hotel, found out if they were going to
have a show; that is why I think it was Friday now, asking Andy Anderson.
I think we picked up and left that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you make any telephone calls that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Breck might have called his mother in Galveston. I don’t
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What are the names of the people you refer to as his mother
and father?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Mr. and Mrs. Tom McKenna.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. They are not his real parents though?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No; they raised him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you make a phone call to Emerson 1-4534 on the day of
the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Emerson 1-4534. Who was it? I don’t remember the number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I am not able to give that to you, Mr. Peterson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Well, then I can’t remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about Riverside 2-6811?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Riverside 2-6811? I don’t know that number either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall any telephone calls which you made on November
22 or 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No; like I say, the only calls I probably made were around
the hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you arrive at Galveston; to the best of your
recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. If we left Friday it takes 4 hours. We probably left about,
maybe 5, 6. Got there about 11 or 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do after arriving in Galveston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Made ourselves at home like we always do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was there when you arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Mr. and Mrs. McKenna; the family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Anybody besides Mr. and Mrs. McKenna?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No; I don’t think so. I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you make any telephone calls from Galveston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Mr. Wall make any telephone calls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Somebody called us, newspaper people, I think, out of Washington,
some magazine wanted to know some stuff, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What magazine was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I have no idea. Some newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall specifically the name of the man who called you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you talk to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I think I did. Yes; I did talk to him. That is why I remember.
I’m trying to think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To the best of your recollection tell me specifically what you
said to him and what he said to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Well, just wanted to know—let me see. Was it there or was
it at the hotel? They wanted a—Time, I think it was Time, or Life, because
the man in Life is located in Dallas. He just wanted to know if we had any
pictures with Jack Ruby or anything we had done for a story. I told him we
did not have anything. Didn’t bother with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. While you were in Galveston did you receive any other telephone
calls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Yes; I’m trying to think. Somebody from some newspaper; I
believe it was in Washington. Some magazine or some newspaper. Breck
probably will remember better than I do. He has a better memory. They
wanted some information on Jack Ruby. I couldn’t give them any.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_620">620</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Aside from that call, did Breck Wall receive any telephone call
while you were in Galveston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I think he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. From whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Well, the only one was from Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Tell me about that call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Jack was very upset <span class="locked">about——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did it come in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. It was in the evening some time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. On the day before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Before what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Before the assassination or before the shooting of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Before the shooting of Oswald. I’m getting them both mixed
up. It was the day before Oswald’s assassination, or murder, whatever you
want to call it. Jack called and was very upset about the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you talk to Ruby on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I don’t think I did. I think Breck did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Breck Wall relate to you what that conversation was about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. The call would have been Saturday. We went down there
Friday. That is when it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was that telephone conversation between Jack Ruby
and Breck Wall all about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. What I just told you. Breck kind of soothed him a little
bit. Nothing you could do. All this baloney. Well, it happened, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know whether Ruby said anything about intending to
do anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No; not to my knowledge. He didn’t relate that to me. Just
he was very upset. Very sick; crying and all of that. That was it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any other subject discussed between Ruby and Breck
Wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No; Jack was very close to us. He made himself close to us,
you know. We were always in the headlines. Always in the newspapers. We
were very good friends with a lot of people in Dallas. He kind of tried to keep
up with us, you know, close. Anytime he had any problems or things like that
he always came to talk to us about it, or ideas for the club. He came to bug us
about that, you know. We were more or less successful in Dallas. Like I
say; the best thing to do was just be nice and kind of stay away as much as
possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there any other telephone calls which you made or which
you received while you were in Galveston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Not—I can’t remember right now. I just don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there any other telephone calls which Breck Wall made or
received while the two of you were in Galveston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. He probably talked to Tony Zoppi.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Zoppi?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Zoppi; he is the amusement critic on the Dallas Morning News.
We are very close friends. He probably talked to him about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You don’t recall specifically? You presume that might have
have happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are there any other calls you know about while you were in
Galveston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you go back to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Probably Tuesday. I think we went back Tuesday. We had
a show Tuesday. Ordinarily do. The show is closed for the weekend. It was
Tuesday when we went back; I’m pretty sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever talked to Jack Ruby after the day of the shooting
of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No; I got a little, letters from him, note when he was in jail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_621">621</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you receive that note?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. It was a few days after the FBI questioned us. He wrote
me a little thank you note because I spoke up for him. Like I am telling you,
he was all right in spite of him being no good, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did the FBI question you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. When we were in Dallas. When we were working at the hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall the approximate date when they talked to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Possibly a week, 2 weeks after the <span class="locked">Oswald——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where were you then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Living at the hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was the interview with the Federal Bureau of Investigation
conducted at your hotel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Yes; it was at the hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was present at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I think it was Mr.—who is the head of the FBI in Dallas?
He was the one. Griffin. Griffith. I believe it was Griffith.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was anybody with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. There was somebody else sitting at the table. I’m not sure
who it was. Tony Zoppi; I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Zoppi was present at the time of the interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I believe; he was either there before, after. Tony always has
breakfast there. We were all sitting at the table. Mr. Griffith came over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The special agent in charge there is Gordon Shanklin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. This was Mr. Griffith.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was Mr. Shanklin present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was Mr. Wall present at the time Mr. Griffith talked to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I don’t know; he might have been. Seems to me three people
were at the table. I’m trying to recollect. Breck might have been there. We
eat breakfast together there usually. It was either breakfast or lunch. I’m
never sure which it is because we always get up around 11 or 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When Mr. Griffith or Griffin interviewed you, did you tell him
about the telephone call that Jack Ruby made to Breck Wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Yes; we told him all that. In fact this is a little clearer than
that. Everything is a little fresher in my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you sure you told him of that telephone call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I don’t know if I did; I’m sure Breck did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you present when Breck Wall talked to the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No; I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How can you say you are sure Breck Wall told him of the telephone
call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Because Breck is very much in the habit of doing the right
thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that would be your presumption he did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You actually weren’t there when Breck Wall talked to the FBI
man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I’m pretty sure I wasn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall whether or not you personally told the agent from
the FBI about the telephone call from Ruby in Galveston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I’m pretty sure I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you interviewed by the FBI more than once or once?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Just the once, although I felt like it was more than once
talking to them going up and down in the elevators, there were a hundred of
them there. Couldn’t miss them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know how Ruby knew how to call you in Galveston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. What he probably did was call the hotel and ask where we
were because we always left a telephone call where we were at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why do you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. It was our policy to do that. If they wanted to start the show
they had to know where we were at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you find out Ruby had shot Oswald?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_622">622</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. When we were watching TV.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Galveston; in McKenna’s home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you recognize Ruby then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You could recognize Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Couldn’t miss it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was your reaction on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Shock. Unbelievable, really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know whether Breck Wall called Phil Burleson from
Galveston that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I think he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the purpose of that call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I have no idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he discuss it with you before he made the call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know whether he called Nancy Austin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. He probably called everybody up when that happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know specifically whether the call was to Nancy Austin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I think probably. Because of what he saw on the TV and
about the show.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know Eddie Parker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Oh, yes; he used to work for us backstage at the Adolphus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he ever call him up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Probably. In reference to the show because he had connection
with Tressler in the show.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Mr. Breck Wall call him up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. He probably did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was his purpose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. In regards to the show.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know a Patricia Farmer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know a Clarence Vought?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. A lot of these people I might know when I see them. Breck
knows. He is good on names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The name Clarence Vought doesn’t mean anything to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What relatives, if any, does Tom McKenna have in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I don’t know anything about them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know R. D. Matthews?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No; I don’t remember. I might.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know anything about Jack Ruby’s trip to Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Nothing. Only thing I know about that is when I read it
later in the papers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you know a man by the name of Henry Atcheson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Or Henry Acteson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No. I am saying no to a lot of these. I may know them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know anything about a telephone call to Mr. Atcheson
or Mr. Acteson in Canada back in March of 1964?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. That I made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever make such a call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Breck Wall ever make such a call to your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. He might have. I don’t know. Canada? Only one thing we
had to do, that was a man who wanted to buy the show for one night and
fly us up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Wohl, W-o-h-l. He got in touch with us about a show.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What part of Canada was he from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I don’t recollect right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was his first name?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_623">623</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I think it was Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he in Calgary, Alberta, Canada?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. That is it. Calgary. Some organization. He was trying to
get us booked for this, whatever it was, that they celebrate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was his name Wall, W-a-l-l?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No; Breck Wall is my partner. This other was Wohl,
W-o-h-l.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Maybe I’m spelling it wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he with you in the Adolphus Hotel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. He comes to our hotel quite a lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he with you in March of 1964?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Well, he stayed there at the hotel. He saw a show two or
three times. He talked to us about the chance of booking a show in Canada.
He would get in touch with this organization he was with and let us know,
which he did by letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever work that deal out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Well, it just never materialized.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did he pronounce his name again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Wohl, I believe it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Phonetically it sounds the same as W-a-l-l?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. He was from Calgary, Alberta, Canada?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Yes. I’m pretty sure that is it. In fact I think we still got
that letter. I know it is W-o-h-l because I remarked on it, about Breck Wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You say you still do have that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I’m pretty sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you look for that and send it to me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Sure. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let me write my name and address down for you so you can do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Fine. If I don’t have the letter we could get in touch with
the hotel. He always stays there. I’m sure they have records.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. His first name was Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I’m sure it was Jack; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Here is my name and address in Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. He was connected with a big oil company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. If you can find that letter and send it to me, I would be much
obliged to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do immediately after the assassination, if you
recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Well, we checked the hotel about the show.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you go down to the Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. I think we did; ran down to take a look.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the purpose of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Curiosity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that the only purpose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Yes; along with a couple of thousand other people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall what your reaction was when Breck Wall received
some telephone calls in Galveston from the Washington Post and from the
Dallas Morning News and the Dallas Times Herald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. That is it. Washington Post. Well, I got a little angry, told
him not to say anything over the phone until we got back home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why did you tell him not to say anything over the phone until
you got back home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Well, you don’t know who you are talking to over the phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any other reason in mind besides that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No; not at all. The only one I could recognize was the Dallas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_624">624</span>
Morning News people we knew. That was fine, but anybody else, I don’t know
who we were talking to. A lot of nuts would be calling you up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you know anything about Mr. Ruby’s troubles with the
American Guild of Variety Artists?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Jack had all kinds of problems and troubles with unions and
everybody else. Jack was like every other struggling nightclub owner who was
trying to get along the cheapest way he could. That was it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Does the telephone number Riverside 8-1434 in Dallas mean
anything to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Let me see. No, I don’t know. Probably does, but I don’t
remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add which you think would be helpful
to the President’s Commission in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Prior to the time when we went on the record here, Mr. Peterson,
did you and I have a very brief conversation concerning your knowledge of
Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Yes; we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have I covered those questions and a number of others during the
course of the deposition on the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is the information which you gave to me on the record the
same as what you told me off the record earlier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Yes; what I could remember—wait a minute, now. You said
“before”——</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We have covered, have we <span class="locked">not——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Everything on the record which we covered before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Under the rules of the President’s Commission, Mr. Peterson,
you have a right to read and to sign this deposition if you want to. Do you
want to do that or would you be willing to waive that reading and signing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Well, what does—do you want me to sign it? I will sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have any special interest in reading it and signing it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Well, I’d like to read it, then I will sign it. I have no objection
to signing it but I’d like to read what I’m signing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That is fair enough. You did receive a letter from the
Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Informing you you had a right to counsel if you wanted one
here today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Right. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And the other rules and regulations concerning the proceedings
in depositions before the President’s Commission, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And appearing here today was satisfactory with you as you
have appeared and testified without the representation of counsel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Peterson</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. That concludes the deposition, then, Mr. Peterson.
We shall make available a copy of the transcript for you to read and sign.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, about 3 years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were the circumstances of your making his acquaintance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I was with the police department at the time and I was working
that area where his club was, and it was a routine check of his place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did you and Jack Ruby get along during the time you
knew him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. We spoke. And sometimes he would get mad and I would talk
to him and calm him down a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How often did you visit Jack Ruby’s club, the Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. He would get mad with some of his help, some of his employees
mostly, or customers. And he was erratic and hotheaded.</p>

or hotheaded?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, sometimes he would get so mad that he would shake.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What would cause him to get that mad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Anything. I mean, he would just fly off the handle about anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you give me a specific illustration of what caused him on
any occasion to become that angry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Mostly with his help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. A moment ago you said that you had disagreements with him
over the way he treated his help. What was it about the way he treated his
help which caused you to have any disagreement with Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, they would want to quit and he would get upset about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that in relation only to Mrs. Kay Olsen who was an
employee of his, or did that apply to other employees as well?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_627">627</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why was it that you were concerned about other employees?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. He would talk to me about it and ask me what I thought, and I
would try to tell him to just calm down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But as a result of those conversations with Ruby, you had disagreements
with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Not very often. Not very often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you give me any other information as to what caused any
disagreement between you and Jack Ruby?</p>

early fall of 1963 on up until the time that you married her in December of 1963,
or January of 1964?</p>

Kay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. While talking with other officers. I couldn’t specifically say

Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

Stemmons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did it happen that you were not on duty with the police
department on the day President Kennedy was in town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I had my leg in a cast and I was doing light duty, which was
working in the office, patrol office, and I had asked them if they needed me to
work that day and they said no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What sort of an accident did you have to injure your leg?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I fell and broke my kneecap.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did that occur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. A woman called me on the phone who was a friend of the person
who had lived there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know who that woman was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, sir. And she wanted to know if I had heard the news, and I
said no and she said, “The President has been shot.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did that telephone call occur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Right after he was shot. I don’t know exactly what time it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you talk to anybody else on the telephone or in person between
the telephone call and the time that Kay visited you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Passers-by. I went outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Whom did you see outside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No one who I knew by name. They just said, “Have you heard
the news?” And I said, “Yes, I had.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_630">630</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any other telephone calls while you were guarding
that house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I called the police department and asked them if they needed me
to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To whom did you talk at the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I don’t recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What response did you get?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. They said no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did Kay visit you on that Friday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. In the afternoon sometime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did she stay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, I would say an hour or two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you have lunch on that Friday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. There at the place that I was watching.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you have supper that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. At her house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you go to her house? And by “her” I take it
you mean Kay’s house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then what time did you go to Kay’s house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. When I got—when the motorcycle officer came and relieved me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. About what time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, 8; about 8.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have an automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did you get from the house which you were guarding to
Kay’s house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Walked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How far was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. About 4 blocks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did the cast on your knee restrict your walking in any material
way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you able to walk with the cast on your knee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. A little bit, not much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But you were able to walk well enough to cover those 4 blocks
to Kay’s house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes. And it swelled after I had walked it, though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do after arriving at Kay’s house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, going back to that, I had crutches, I believe, that I used.
Now, what was the question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. After you arrived at Kay’s house, what did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. We talked about the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did you stay at Kay’s house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I would say several hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And about what time did you leave Kay’s house, to the best of
your ability to recollect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. What time I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was anybody else at Kay’s house with you besides Kay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In what manner did you travel away from Kay’s house, by foot,
by car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. By car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Whose car was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How was it that you didn’t have your car at the house which
you were guarding?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I didn’t want to drive it, I don’t remember why. I think I left
it for her to use.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Kay go with you when you drove away from her house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_631">631</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Downtown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the purpose of your trip to town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. To see where the President was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you go then to Dealey Plaza?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, we drove by there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you go anyplace else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. We went to a garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was that garage located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Jackson and Field.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the purpose of going to a garage at Jackson and
Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. We knew the man who worked there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Johnny is all I know him by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What sort of work did he do at that garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. He was an attendant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why did you want to go see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. To talk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. For any special purpose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recollect about what time you arrived at that garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, 12, approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see Johnny when you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see anybody else while you were at that garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who else did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see anybody else besides Johnny and Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Not that I remember; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, before seeing Ruby at the garage on that Friday night,
when had you seen him most recently before that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. It could have been a few days or a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall where it was that you saw him prior to this
Friday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, it was probably outside of his club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall the specific instance, or are you just saying what
you think probably occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I am just saying what probably occurred, because I don’t remember
when I saw him before that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have any recollection what your conversation was with
Mr. Ruby when you saw him prior to this Friday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did you talk to Mr. Ruby on this Friday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Two or three hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who else was present at the time of the conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Kay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Johnny.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there anybody besides Johnny and Kay and Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Tell me as specifically as you can recall exactly what it was
that Ruby said and what it was that you and Kay and Johnny said in reply
to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. We were all upset about the President’s assassination, and we
were just talking about how we hated it, that it was a tragedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Jack Ruby say something to that effect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes; very strongly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall what his exact words were, by any chance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I believe he said something to the effect that “It’s too bad that a
peon,” or a person like Oswald, “could do something like that,” referring to
shooting the President and the officer, Officer Tippit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_632">632</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he say anything more about Oswald at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. He cursed him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What specific language did he use?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. S.o.b.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any other specific curse that you recollect Ruby used
in describing Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. He could have said something else, but I remember that. I’m
sure that he did say something else, but I don’t remember what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he say anything at that time about whether or not he knew
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he say anything at that time about whether or not he knew
Officer J. D. Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. It seemed that he did know Officer Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why do you say, “It seemed that he did know Officer Tippit”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I believe he said that Tippit had been to his club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Recollect as specifically as you can exactly what he said about
that, if you can, Mr. Olsen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Something about Oswald shooting the President and Officer Tippit
and leaving the wife and children, and he kept referring to Jacqueline.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, how about what you were referring to concerning Ruby’s
knowing Officer Tippit? What exactly did Ruby say at that time, to the best of
your ability to recollect, about any relationship or acquaintanceship between
Jack Ruby and J. D. Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, I just don’t remember if there was anything specifically
said about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you say to Ruby during that conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I said it was a tragedy that this happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did Johnny say to Ruby at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. And he said, yes; it sure was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Johnny say anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, we all talked; I don’t remember what exactly was said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you remember anything specifically that Kay said at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No. It was a shame that it had happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall whether or not Kay said something to the effect
that “In England they would have Oswald by his toes and drag him through
the street”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, sir; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had Kay talked to Ruby earlier on that Friday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I believe that she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that in person or by telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I believe it was by phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was she when she talked to him by phone, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. At her house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where was Ruby, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I think he was at his house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At what time did that telephone conversation occur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I believe it was in the afternoon sometime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the purpose of that call, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. To find out if she had heard about the President’s assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there anything else said by either Kay or Ruby at that
time when they had telephone conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I wasn’t—I don’t believe I was there when she talked to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How do you know about the call then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. She said that she had talked to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know whether or not they discussed whether or not
the Carousel Club would be open that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I believe they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And do you know what Ruby said about that subject matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. He said that it would not be open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_633">633</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know whether Kay telephoned Ruby or Ruby telephoned
Kay on the occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long were you at that garage at Jackson and Field before
you saw Jack Ruby on that Friday night or early Saturday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, 30 minutes to an hour, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could that garage be located on Jackson and Akard, A-k-a-r-d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How far is Jackson and Akard from Jackson and Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. One block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you discuss with Ruby the fact that he closed his club that
night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you say to him, if you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I said that it should be closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you congratulate him for having closed it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you shake his hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I don’t recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you pretty emotionally upset about the assassination of
President Kennedy at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was Kay pretty emotionally upset about the assassination at
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about Johnny?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. He was, too; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how about Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What indication was there that you observed that Ruby was
emotionally upset about the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. He was very nervous.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In what way was that evident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, in his speech and his actions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any other indication that you were able to observe
that Ruby was upset about the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, the way he talked, and that was it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Ruby mention anything about the Weissman advertisement
that appeared in the Dallas papers earlier that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did he say about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. He said they shouldn’t be open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What Weissman advertisement had appeared earlier that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Just the usual ad in the paper about them being open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any advertisement in the paper that day containing
derogatory statements about President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. There was something in the paper, I believe, about somebody
carrying banners in one part of town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What kind of banners were those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I believe they were about President Kennedy, and what they said,
I don’t remember what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you remember Ruby’s comment about that, or whether he
made one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I believe he did say something about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall what it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. He said that it wasn’t right, and “I just wonder how they feel
about it now.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he say anything about the radicals in Dallas at that particular
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he say anything about the effect of all that on the Jews?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I believe he did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_634">634</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did he say about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No; he didn’t; I don’t believe he said anything about that; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, at about what time was <span class="locked">it——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Let me think about that for a minute, will you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Go ahead; take your time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I heard something about him saying after he shot Oswald that he
wondered if the other Jews would blame him for what he had done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you hear that from Ruby personally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No; it was hearsay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I either read it or heard it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall where you read it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I <span class="locked">believe——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Or from whom you heard it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. It was either in the paper or from someone who had been to visit
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who might it have been who was to visit him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Wally Weston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who is Wally Weston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. He was the master of ceremonies there in his club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you last talk to Wally Weston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. When I was in the hospital after the car accident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did that car accident occur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. December 7.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long were you in the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Two weeks, two and a half weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What injuries did you sustain in that automobile collision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I rebroke my leg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In the same place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. The same place and some more breaks. And I cracked my chest
bone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating your sternum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir. And I broke some ribs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What hospital were you in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Methodist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What else did Wally Weston have to say on that occasion, if
anything, about Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. He couldn’t understand why he did it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Weston say anything further about Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now told me everything you can remember about
that conversation among you and Ruby and Kay and Johnny that night in the
garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Between who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Ruby, Kay, Johnny, and you at the garage the Friday night or
early Saturday morning of the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I can’t think of anything else. It was a conversation about what
had happened to the President and Officer Tippit, and everyone was very upset
about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time, to the best of your ability or recollection, did that
conversation end?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Two or three in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I took Kay home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see <span class="locked">any——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Jack left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see anybody or talk to anybody else later that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you do after taking Kay home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. We talked a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you do next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I think I went home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_635">635</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you awaken on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, probably 11 in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you have breakfast on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. At her house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you go to her house? And by “her” I take it
you mean Kay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir. Oh, 12 or 1 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see anybody else on Saturday besides Kay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who else did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I saw Ruby Saturday night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was it that you saw Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. In front of his club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At what time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, 10 or 11 at night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you speak to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the circumstances under which you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. We were driving by and he was standing outside and we waved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he see you and wave at you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do from the time you got to Kay’s house until
the time that you saw Ruby standing in front of his club on that Saturday
night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Watched some television and listened to the radio a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see or talk to anybody else either in person or by telephone
from the time you got to Kay’s house until the time you saw Ruby that
Saturday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, sir; I don’t guess we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do after you saw Ruby in front of his club that
Saturday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. What did we do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you and Kay do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. We drove by where the President was shot, we drove by there
several times, and drove around town a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you finish driving around town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, I guess 1 or 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see anybody else you knew while you were driving around town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. We did, but I don’t remember who it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you stop and talk to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir. I don’t remember who it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you go when you finished driving around town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I took her home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you arrive at her home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I would say 2 or 3 in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, we talked about what had happened more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did that conversation last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, I guess about an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Went to bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you sleep that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I could have slept on her couch. Either that or I went back to my apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At what time did you awaken Sunday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, 10 or 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you have breakfast?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_636">636</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. At her house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And by “her” you mean Kay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you do after breakfast? First, did you go to
Kay’s house right after you awakened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then how long did you stay at Kay’s house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I think we were there when Ruby shot Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did you learn that Ruby had shot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. It was either the radio or the television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you watching TV at the time that it happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I believe so. If not, we turned it on right after we had heard it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was anyone else present in Kay’s house except you and Kay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Her children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What are the names of her children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Susan and Sheri.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How old is Susan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Nine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How old is Sheri?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Seven.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was anyone else present besides you and Kay and Susan and
Sheri?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, sir; they could have been outside playing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did you stay at Kay’s house that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, several hours, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see anybody else before you left Kay’s house that day,
on that Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Not that I recall. I could have seen somebody who lives there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Such as who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, the landlord.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I don’t remember his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you talk to anybody by telephone that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I don’t recall if I called the police department or not, whether
they wanted me to come down and work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you on duty that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How was it that you were off for 3 days in a row?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I had a holiday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What do you mean by “a holiday”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, like Christmas or Thanksgiving, or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You mean you had a compensatory day coming for having worked
a holiday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you hear any announcement that day that Oswald was
about to be moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did you happen to hear that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. On television, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And specifically, what was that announcement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. That he was being moved from the city jail to the county jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you talk to anybody about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you tell Ruby about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you talk to Ruby that Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever talked to Ruby at any time after that conversation
you had with him in the garage on late Friday night or early Saturday morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you leave Kay’s house on Sunday, November 24,
to the best of your ability to recollect?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_637">637</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I would say 9 or 10 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In the evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you go then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. We drove by city hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you stop?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you stop at city hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you go after dropping by city hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. We drove by where the President was assassinated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was Kay with you at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I believe she was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you go next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I believe we went to her house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did you stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you contact anybody after you learned Oswald was shot
by Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you contact anybody after you learned that Oswald was
shot by Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I believe I called the police department and asked them if they
wanted me to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Aside from that call, did you contact anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when you called the police department what did they tell
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. They didn’t need me to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did she work for Ruby last preceding the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Thursday, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you end your employment with the Dallas Police
Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. The latter part of December.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the reason for leaving the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I wanted to come to California.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Nobody at the Dallas Police Department asked you to leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who asked you to leave the Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Chief Curry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the reason for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I was out of sick time; in other words, you are allotted so much
sick time a year, and he didn’t want to extend me any more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that the only reason why he asked you to terminate your
employment with the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. That was one of the reasons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any other reason?</p>

<p>(Long pause.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I don’t remember exactly what was said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any special reason why you went to California?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. We heard the climate was nice out here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know a Bertha Cheek? Does that name ring a bell with
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who is she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I have heard the name. Can you help me a little bit with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, do you recollect anything about her at this moment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, sir; I have heard the name, though.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_638">638</span>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, do you know of any Bertha Cheek who has an apartment
building in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Not that I know of, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. From the time President Kennedy was assassinated through
the rest of that Friday and Saturday and Sunday did you see or talk to Little
Lynn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Bruce Carlin, during that same time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Bruce Carlin. I notice a quizzical look on your face. Do you
know who Bruce Carlin is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever see Oswald before the assassination of President
Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know at all whether Ruby knew Oswald prior to the
assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know Eugene Smith?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I don’t remember. I might know him if I would see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know whether Ruby knew anyone by the name of
Eugene Smith?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know whether Ruby was a member of any subversive
organization; that is, an organization which advocates the forceful overthrow
of the U.S. Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. To my knowledge, he was never a member of anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know whether any of his friends or family were members
of such an organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know whether Ruby associated with any of the criminal
element.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he ever associate with any of the criminal element?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I think he did in Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What, is the basis for your saying that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I had heard that he had been with a gang in Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, it could have been Ruby himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall for sure whether or not it was Ruby who told you
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I recall that he did—he had said something about being with a—or,
how rough Chicago used to be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, did he say anything beyond how rough it was, to the
effect that he was with a criminal gang or anything of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know anything about Ruby’s trip to Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What do you know about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. He said he was going to Cuba to get acts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To get what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Acts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. A-c-t-s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. For his nightclub?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did he go to Cuba, if you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I remember when he went, but I don’t remember the date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any other purpose that you know about in Ruby’s
going to Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No. He seemed to be quiet about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know anything about Ruby’s attitude toward the John
Birch Society?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_640">640</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know anything about his attitude toward the Minutemen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever hear Ruby say anything about the sign on impeaching
Chief Justice Earl Warren?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Would you repeat that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever hear Ruby say anything about a sign or advertisement
which said “Impeach Chief Justice Earl Warren of the U.S. Supreme
Court”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. He could have said something about it, but I don’t remember.
I think that he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Off the record for just a minute.</p>

<p>(There was a discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add which you think would be helpful
to the President’s Commission in any way, Mr. Olsen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I wish I did. If I did, I would tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But you don’t?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Not that I can think of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. Now, under the procedure of the Commission, Mr.
Olsen, we can make this deposition transcript available to you to read and
to sign, if you want to, or you can forego your right to do that on what is
called a waiver.</p>

<p>Would you like to read and sign the deposition; that is, this record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Should I?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, it’s up to you. If you want to, you can, it’s up to you.
There is some doubt in your mind, so I think we will make it available to
you to read and to sign.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. OK.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much for coming, Mr. Olsen, and that concludes
the deposition.</p>

<p>(There was a discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let’s go back on the record just a minute.</p>

<p>Mr. Olsen, did we have a brief conversation before I administered the oath
to you and the court reporter started to take down my questions and your
answers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did I cover in a general way the questions which I have
since asked you on the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you give me the same information which you have given
on the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And were you subsequently employed by Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, it took me about a month to think it over, because everybody
thought he wouldn’t last, you know, they thought his business wouldn’t last,

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever have any disagreements with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes; about, you know, trying to get a day off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the cause, did you say, of the disagreement?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Trying to get a day off. That was about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever have any other difficulties with Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No; not really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there ever romantic interest between you and Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did you meet Mr. Olsen, your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. When I was working up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At the Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did Mr. Ruby and Mr. Olsen get along?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, over me once in a while, trying to get some time off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_643">643</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there ever any other disagreement between Mr. Ruby and
Mr. Olsen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, he didn’t think that Harry should come up there so much,
me working there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How frequently did Harry come to the club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, maybe on Saturday night for an hour or something, you know
about once a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Mr. Ruby ever do any favors for Mr. Olsen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I think it was 325 North Ewing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did Mr. Olsen live at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. 1963? I think he was at Theatre Lane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did Mr. Ruby live in September of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I think he lived on Ewing, too. I don’t know the address; it
was out further.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was your relationship with Mr. Olsen in the fall or
September of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, steady.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You were going together steadily?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have plans to marry at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes. But we couldn’t because of me working, and, you know,
the police department, the wives couldn’t work in a place like that, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any other reason why you couldn’t marry Mr. Olsen
at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was his divorce final at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, I guess. I don’t know when he got it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he separated from his wife in the fall of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I think he was divorced. This is just last September?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes; he was divorced then. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Ruby ever visit Mr. Olsen at his apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Mr. Ruby ever visit you at your apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, he has been over for breakfast with a group, a group of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On how many occasions was he at your apartment; that is,
on how many occasions was Mr. Ruby at your apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, I would say twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were others always present on those occasions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes. It’s hard to remember all this, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How far was your apartment from Mr. Ruby’s in the fall of
1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, I would say a mile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. It wasn’t a block away?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No. I’m not very good at distances, but it was way at the end.
He lived way out on Ewing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many blocks was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, I don’t know. He lived in two places, he lived on Marsalis
once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did he live on Marsalis? How do you spell that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. M-a-r-s-a-l-i-s.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did he live at the Marsalis residence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, well, I know he was there on July the 4th the year before,
because we always spent July 4th over there, all the employees.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was he living in the fall of 1963, say September, October,
November?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_644">644</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Ewing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how far was his Ewing Street residence from your residence
at 325 Ewing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, do you know the block number? Could you give me a
block number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. No; I am not able to do that. Do you recollect his block number?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No; I don’t know it. I just know the big apartment building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And you don’t know how many blocks it was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I don’t; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you work at Mr. Ruby’s Carousel Club on a daily basis;
that is, did you work every day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes; 7 days a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall Friday, November 22, 1963, the day President
Kennedy was assassinated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When had you seen Mr. Ruby before that Friday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Thursday night at work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And do you recall whether you had any conversation with Mr.
Ruby on Thursday, November 21?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No; I can’t remember. I didn’t used to talk to him too much,
I stayed out of his way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Tell me as precisely as you can recollect what you did on Friday,
November 22.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Harry was guarding an estate on 8th Street just a ways from
where I lived, and I fixed a lunch for him and stopped off at the 7-11 store
to get him some milk, and that’s when I heard that there had been some trouble
downtown; a colored lady told me that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time was that that you stopped at the 7-11 store?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, I guess about 12:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In the afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes. I can’t remember the morning. I had the children and
I can’t remember. We probably had been in the pool or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you awaken that Friday morning, if you recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. It was probably late, because I worked that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And you cared for your children in the morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many children have you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Two girls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And their names and ages?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Susan is 9½ and Sheri is 7.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Both of these children were born during your first marriage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And after picking up the milk at the 7-11 store, what did you
do next?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I went up to give Harry his lunch, and he had heard it; some
woman had called. He was sitting there and some woman had called and she
wanted to speak to the lady that was supposed to be there. Harry answered
the phone and she told him, I think, about the President getting shot, because
he already knew when I got there, so we sat in the car and listened to the car
radio, and that’s how we knew about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long were you there at the house Harry was guarding?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, I guess about an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do next?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I called from there down to the club and this is when Harry
said, “You are going to quit; this is it,” you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why did Harry say that to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, I was on the verge of it anyway, we were going to come
out here last August and we kept putting it off and putting it off, and—wait a
minute, maybe I’m wrong. I called in and I said, “Are we open tonight?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who did you talk to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. The bartender.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_645">645</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Andrew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Andrew what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At the Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did the bartender say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I didn’t get to talk to Jack Ruby. Apparently he was crying
and everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Andy told me. And I said, “What is Jack doing?” And he said,
“Oh, he is all upset and he is crying.” And he said, “We are closed tonight.”
And after all this happened, oh, I had no desire to get back in that business or
anything, I was just sick over it anyway, so that’s when I said, “Well, I’m not
going back.” I didn’t tell Jack this or anything, you know, because, you see,
we are union and we have to give notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You told Mr. Olsen that day that you did not intend to go back
to work for Mr. Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, business, the whole business, I was through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And you made a telephone call from the house that Mr. Olsen
was guarding?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I went home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At about what time did you make that telephone call?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, I guess it was around 1:15. The President was killed at 1
o’clock, wasn’t he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. 12:30.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, I must have got there a little before that, then, because
I didn’t hear it until I sat in the car with Harry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, didn’t some lady tell you about it at the 7-11 store?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, she said the President had been shot; that’s what she said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then what is your best recollection about when you left that
house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, I guess about 1:30. So I must have called about 1:15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then where did you go next?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I was going to take the girls to the show.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What show?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I didn’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Some movie?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes; a movie. And, well, I didn’t; I wasn’t in the mood to sit
in a movie, you know, and I really can’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see anybody that afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I went and sat with my landlady.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is her name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. She was the manager of the apartment; Mrs. Hall. We sat
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is Mrs. Hall’s first name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where does she live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Ewing; 325 North Ewing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you left the house that Mr. Olsen was guarding, did you
go right back to your own residence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see anybody that afternoon besides Mrs. Hall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No. Just, I guess, neighbors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which neighbors?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I don’t know. I can’t remember the names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you telephone anybody?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No; I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you do later in the afternoon, if anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I fixed supper for Harry and the girls. I think he got off about
4 that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_646">646</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, he was guarding the house that day. Did he finish guarding
the house at 4?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I think the man relieved him—it was 6. The other policeman
relieved him at 6.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What policeman was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then Mr. Olsen came over to your residence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, as far as I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how long did he stay there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, we watched TV and, oh, we sat in front of that TV set for
a long time, and we were all nervous and upset, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was anybody else there besides you and Mr. Olsen and your two
children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you call anybody that evening by telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did anybody call you that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No. This is as far as I can recollect. I mean I can’t be positive.
I just can’t remember that day too well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how long did Mr. Olsen stay there that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. We went out. We, you know, got nervous sitting there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At what time did you go out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, it was late; it was about 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. We went downtown to a private club. We wanted a drink; we
were kind of shook up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What club did you go to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. It was the Sip and Nip on Commerce Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Sip and Nip?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see anybody there that you knew?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, we knew the bartender and the waitress. Because we didn’t
get out, you know, too often with me working all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the bartender’s name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I think his name was Lee. I’m pretty sure it was Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the waitress’ name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I can’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see anybody else you knew?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No; not there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did you stay there at the club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, they close at 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see anybody else you knew someplace else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, we went—do you want to know later what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Fine.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. We went to the parking lot; we used to go over there and talk
to Johnny.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Johnny who?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where is the parking lot located?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Right behind the Carousel Club; across the street on—what
street would that be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Akard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Akard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Jackson and Akard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Jackson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that at the intersection of Jackson and Akard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No. Jackson and the next street down. What was that? Field;
Jackson and Field. And we sat in there and we talked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did you talk to Johnny?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, quite a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was anybody else there at that time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_647">647</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Not that I remember; no. And we were sitting there; it was
late, and that’s when Jack Ruby drove by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did he drive by?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, I can’t be positive on these times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. About what time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I guess around 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he stop?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes. We waved, and he stopped. He stopped at a red light and
pulled in and he came in and sat in the car and talked to us for quite a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did that conversation last?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, I guess an hour or so at least.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As nearly as you can recollect, tell me exactly what he said and
what you said to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, everyone was shocked, you know, and we talked about
Mrs. Kennedy and the children and how terrible it was, and he told us he had
been down to the police station to take the boys some sandwiches down there,
and he was real upset, kind of wild-eyed, had his real stary look, and he was
upset that—well, he was mad that these other clubowners hadn’t closed down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which clubowners?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. The Theatre Lounge and the Colony Club. I hate to remember
all this stuff, I really do. You know, I have such a different life now and I
hate to rehash it all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What else did Mr. Ruby say at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I think he told us he had seen Oswald transferred, if I remember
right, and we asked him what he looked like and he said he looked like a little rat,
real sneaky looking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. He saw him transferred from where to where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I don’t know. He saw him down there. I think as they were
moving him from one room to another.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. He saw down where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. At the police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he say anything more about Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, I guess he cussed him out a bit. He was just real upset.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he say anything about what he intended to do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. About his club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. About anything.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he say he intended to shoot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know whether or not Ruby knew Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I don’t think he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever see Oswald in the club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had you ever seen Oswald at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What else did Ruby say at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. That’s about all I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any conversation about Officer J. D. Tippit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No. Was Tippit shot that day? Yes; he was, wasn’t he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Tippit was shot on Friday afternoon; that day.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes. I can’t remember, because I didn’t know Officer Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know whether or not Mr. Ruby knew Officer J. D. Tippit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, I read in the papers that he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Aside from what you read in the papers, do you have any personal
<span class="locked">knowledge——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As to whether Mr. Ruby knew Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Mr. Olsen know Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. He said he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he know him well?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_648">648</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. He said he had never been over to his house or anything, he just
seen him in the locker room, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. During the course of that conversation what did you say, that is,
when Mr. Ruby came by and you were parked at the parking lot talking to
Johnny?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Just how terrible everything was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall anything else that you said specifically?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No; I can’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you say, “In England they would have hung Oswald by his
toes and dragged him through the street?”</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you make any reference at all to what would happen to
Oswald if he were in England?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there anything else you can recollect about that conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had you talked to Ruby earlier on that Friday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long had you been at that parking lot before Ruby arrived?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I guess about an hour, as close as I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. During the course of that conversation, did Ruby say anything
about the Weissman ad?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I don’t know what you mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you know of any advertisement in the newspaper containing
derogatory remarks or unfavorable comments about President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Mr. Ruby say anything during that conversation about the
radicals in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. The what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The radicals in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I don’t know what that means.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he say anything about the John Birch Society?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he say anything about the Communists in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he say anything about the radical right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Mr. Ruby say anything about the effect on Jews?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you say anything to Mr. Ruby about his closing his club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, just in conversation I asked him how long he thought he
could close. See, I didn’t give him notice or anything, I had to get hold of
the union man first, because the union, you know, you have to give a 2-week
notice, otherwise you have to pay them 2 weeks’ salary. But I got out of that,
I talked to the union man and he said—well, I think they call it an act of God
when something like this happens, and you just don’t want any part of working
like that any more. I think that made all of us think a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you praise Ruby for closing up the club after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes, I thought it was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you tell him so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Mr. Olsen say anything about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, I can’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Mr. Olsen shake his hand for closing up the club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, they used to shake hands all the time. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you upset at that time about the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Very.</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was Mr. Olsen upset?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes; very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how about Mr. Ruby, how was he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Real upset.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_649">649</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe about him that led you to the conclusion
that he was upset?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, he looked awful tired and he would sit back and stare off into
space, and he never cried or anything, but, you know, he would just keep
saying over and over how terrible it was, what a wonderful man the President
was and how sorry he felt for Mrs. Kennedy and the children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. After Mr. Ruby left what did you and Mr. Olsen do next?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. We came home to my house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you arrive at your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, let me see. It was kind of late, I guess around 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do next?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I guess I went to bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did Mr. Olsen do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. He left. He was living on Theatre—yes, he left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. He was living where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Theatre Lane. He went to Theatre Lane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you awaken the next morning, which would have
been Saturday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Now, can I ask you, is this the day Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Oswald was shot on Sunday.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, Saturday? Oh, I would say around 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did <span class="locked">you——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I had to go pick up my daughters, see, from the babysitter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see anybody that you knew on that Saturday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I can’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you telephone anybody?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I can’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did anyone telephone you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, I have girl friends, you know, and we probably called
each other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you recall any specific girl friend who either called you or
whom you called?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see Mr. Olsen later that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I don’t know if he was working or not. I can’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall when you did see him next?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No. Oh, we went out that evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I don’t know. I can’t remember. I’m not being very helpful,
am I? But it was what, 9 months ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall seeing anybody else you knew on that evening
besides Mr. Olsen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. We saw Jack Ruby standing outside of his club. We parked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, I guess around 9. And he was standing outside and he
covered up all these pictures or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. He had covered up the pictures?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I think he had covered up pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What pictures did he cover up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Of the girls, you know, in the show. I think he covered them
up or something, or took them out or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why did he do that, do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you talk to Mr. Ruby on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No. We just pulled in the parking lot and said “Hi, how are you,”
and he said “OK.” It was just hello and goodbye, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever talked to Mr. Ruby since that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do next?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. That evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. We went out, but I can’t remember where.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_650">650</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you remember whether you saw anybody that night, or
whether you talked to anybody you knew?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No; I don’t know. I don’t even know where we went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you arrive home that night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Probably late.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you make any telephone calls after you arrived home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did Mr. Olsen do after he brought you home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Went home, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall what time you awakened on the next day, which
would have been Sunday, the day Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes; my daughter woke me. Can you tell me what time did this
happen, the shooting, and I can tell you what time I woke up, because my
daughter woke me up and told me about it, because she knew Jack, see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, what is your best recollection as to what time your daughter
awakened you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I expect 11:30, I guess. Because I get up in the morning and
fix their breakfast and everything and then I go back to bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did she say to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. She said, “Jack shot Oswald,” and I said, “Oh, no; don’t be
silly,” you know, but I got out of bed and turned on the TV and it was just—it
was just coming on, I think then, and I recognized him by the back of his
head, you know, from his back, and then, of course, my neighbors started
knocking because they knew where I worked and they said, “Have you heard,”
you know, and, oh, I couldn’t believe it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What neighbor did that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, I think my landlady.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mrs. Hall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Mrs. Hall; yes, probably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Anybody else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I think Nancy, one of the girls across the way, came in and
had some coffee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is Nancy’s last name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Ernest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where does she live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. She lives in one of the apartments on Ewing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you talk to anybody else at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No. Because I think that was the night we were going up to—I
had never met Harry’s parents. This was another reason I quit, you know,
and I wouldn’t have to lie to them or anything, you know. And I was hunting
up a babysitter, that’s right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you talk to anybody else on that Sunday by telephone or in
person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do that Sunday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. We went to Wichita Falls—Henrietta, Henrietta.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How far is Henrietta?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. About 160 miles, I think. To Harry’s parents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On Sunday, November 24?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I think that was the night. I’m sure that was the Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you leave Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, about 2 in the afternoon, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what time did you arrive at Henrietta, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I got that wrong. It was dark when we got there. I guess we
left later, about 4. I think we got there about 6:30. It was dark or something,
I don’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did you stay at Henrietta?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, about 3 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what time did you leave?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. About 10, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you drive back to Dallas that night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_651">651</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Whom did you see at Henrietta?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Harry’s parents. And then we visited another friend of the
family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the name of that friend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. His name was Harry. I don’t know his last name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you visit or meet anyone else at Henrietta?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. While you were at Henrietta did you talk to anyone over the
telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do when you arrived back in Dallas late that
Sunday night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Went to bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you listening to the radio or television before Oswald was
shot that Sunday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No; I was sleeping.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you hear any announcements on that day that Oswald was
about to be moved?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see Ruby on that Sunday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you talk to Ruby on that Sunday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. After you heard that Oswald was shot did you contact anybody?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I think I called Jean, my girl friend in Grand Prairie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is Jean’s last name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Jean Simms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In Grand Prairie, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the purpose of contacting her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, about Jack, you know, what a shock it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why did you call her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. She was my closest friend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any specific purpose in calling her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No; it was—you know, when somebody you work for does something
like this you just want to talk to someone, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you call anybody else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did anybody else call you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Not that I can remember. There might have been a girl friend
or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you ever go back to the Carousel Club after that Sunday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. We went up New Year’s Eve for a few minutes just to see some
of the girls that worked up there, and it was a real terrible atmosphere. We
didn’t stay long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Of course, Mr. Ruby wasn’t there at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever go back to work at the Carousel Club after Oswald
was shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you go back to the Carousel Club to get your clothes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you do that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. When I got the clearance from the union, he said it was all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Whom did you deal with to get the clearance from the union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Tom Palmer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How do you spell his last name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. P-a-l-m-e-r.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when did you get the clearance from Mr. Palmer?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_652">652</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, I didn’t work for a couple of weeks there, so it was over
that period, you know, a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When is your best recollection, then, as to when you went back
to the club to get your clothes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, I guess a week later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Whom did you see?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. The bartender let me in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was his name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Andrew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you say to him, if anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, he didn’t have too much to say to me. I think they thought
I was a traitor for not sticking with them, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you crying at the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes; I think I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why were you crying?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I felt sorry for Jack at that time, if I remember rightly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you <span class="locked">say——</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Just a minute, I’m just trying to think. I think Tom Howard,
Jack Ruby’s attorney, was up there at that time, and he got me in tears, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did he get you in tears, so to speak?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, I was upset anyway, and nervous, and, well, he just
talked about Jack said hello to all of us and he didn’t feel bad about me
quitting, anything I wanted to do was all right, not to worry about it, you
know, worry about quitting. You see, most of the girls stayed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was anybody else there at the time you went back to get your
clothes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But you recollect seeing attorney Tom Howard and bartender
Andy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I think that was the same day. I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But were you back there on any other day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No. The way I am confused, one evening we were up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that New Year’s Eve?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Before I got my clothes. No; it was before that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say you were up there, whom do you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Alice and I, a girl friend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is Alice’s last name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I think she quit, too, at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is Alice’s last name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. <span class="locked">Oh——</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Not Alice Nichol?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Alexander.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was it Alice Nichol?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No; Alice Alexander, I think it was. She was a waitress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where does she live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Grand Prairie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when was it that you and she were there together?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I can’t remember. It was some evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Whom did you see when you were there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. It seems like that was the night the attorney was up there.
I went up to get my paycheck; that’s right; I went up to get my paycheck.
That’s the night I was up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Mr. Ruby pay you by check or by cash?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Check, and then we would sign the check and he would give us
the cash, you know, like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who was there on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. What occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you went to get your paycheck.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. That was when Alice came with me. I’m pretty sure that this
was the night that Tom Howard was up there, and that was the night that I
was crying, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there anybody there besides you and Alice and Tom Howard?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_653">653</span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No; I think Andrew was even out of the office quite a bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any occasion to leave Dallas soon after November
24th, the Sunday when Oswald was shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. How soon? What do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Within a few days?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you go to work in Oklahoma City?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes; that was about—I think it was about 2 weeks after. I
wanted to make some money for Christmas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. For whom did you work in Oklahoma City?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. It was the Kings Club. I can’t remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have an arrangement to go up there to work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes; an agent got me a booking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you make that arrangement to go there to work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, within that 2 weeks afterward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see Tammi True in Oklahoma City?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes; I stayed with her; we shared a room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What, if anything, did you tell her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Oh, we discussed a lot of things about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you talk about with respect to Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. What a crazy thing he did. And that I would never go back to
work there. That was about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did you stay with Tammi True?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Three weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did she live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. We had a motel. It was the club owner’s motel where he rented
to the entertainers. I can’t remember the name of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any other reason why you left Dallas to go to
Oklahoma City?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No; just to make some money for Christmas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Mr. Olsen have an accident at about that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes; while I was up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What happened to him exactly?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. He totaled his car; hit a telephone pole.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say “totaled,” you mean a total wreck?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What injuries, if any, did he sustain?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I think he broke two bones in his leg and he separated his shoulder
and he had multiple chest injuries, black eye.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he hospitalized?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Methodist Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why did you later go to California?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Why did we come out here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, we had no desire to stay in Dallas. He used up all his
sick time on the police department, and, well, we wanted to come out here a
year—well, last August we were going to come out here and we didn’t have
enough money, and then he got his settlement from the car and I saved a little
money and so we just came out here. We always wanted to come out to
California.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Going back to the Friday of the assassination and the following
Saturday and the following Sunday when Oswald was shot, during that time
did you see or talk to Little Lynn?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. During that time did you see or talk to Tammi True?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I don’t know who that is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_654">654</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know a Bruce Carlin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

the Friday to the Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you talk to Ralph Paul?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I guess it was Monday when they reopened the club. I think that
was the day they reopened it, I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see Ralph Paul in person or did you talk to him on the
telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I talked to him on the telephone and I told him I wasn’t coming
back to work, and he said, “Well, it’s up to you.” He was very cool.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What connection, if any, did he have with the Carousel Club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I think he is the owner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The coowner with Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I thought Jack Ruby was just like managing it, you know, a front;
that Ralph had all the money in the place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What else was in that conversation between you and Ralph
Paul, if anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. That was it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Ralph Paul tell you that Ruby told him Saturday night he
was going to shoot Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I’m sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Or Mickey Ryan?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I don’t know him—oh, yes; I do; but I didn’t see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. During that same time did you see or talk to Tom Howard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No. Now, this is the Friday to the Sunday, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

November 22 to November 24?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Other than girl friends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Other than the ones you have already told me about.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you receive any telephone calls from the day of the assassination
until the following Sunday, other than those you have already told me
about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever see or hear of Oswald before November 22?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_655">655</span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know Bertha Cheek?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Is this who they call Aunt Bertha, the one that works at the
Colony Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I am not able to say.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Well, that’s the only Bertha I know. I have worked with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever know of any Bertha Cheek who operated an apartment
house?</p>

Government?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know whether any of his family of friends was ever a

in any way to the President’s Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. No. I wish I could help you, but that’s about all I can remember,
just as an employee and that’s about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Before the oath was administered to you, that is, before I swore
you in, did you and I have a very brief conversation about the subject matter
that I would ask you about during this deposition?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you answer the questions for me at that time in the
same way that you have on the record here this afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mrs. Olsen, we permit the witnesses to read the depositions and
to sign them if they wish to do so, and during the course of the deposition with
Mr. Olsen, it was concluded that he would read and sign his deposition, so this
transcript, which is the typing up of the questions and answers, will be made
available to you to read and sign.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Olsen</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And that concludes the deposition and we thank you very much
for coming here today.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
